This spans programs from entry-level hiring through more senior-level\nrecruiting. In 2024, the Corporation hired over 18,000 teammates reflecting a wide\nvariety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives so that we understand and\ncan respond to the needs of our clients and communities. We provide a variety of\nresources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills,\nincluding resources to help employees find new opportunities, re-skill and seek\nleadership positions. We have 11 Employee Networks with over 320,000 voluntary\nmemberships, which provide teammates opportunities to meet new people, have an\nimpact across multiple business lines and grow personally and professionally. They\nare open to all employees and participation is voluntary. In 2024, more than\n12,000 employees found new roles within the Corporation, and we delivered\napproximately 7.6 million hours of training and development to our teammates\nthrough Bank of America Academy. Additionally, our Board oversees Chief Executive\nOfficer and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed at\nleast annually. As part of our ongoing efforts to make the Corporation a great\nplace to work, we conduct a confidential annual Employee Engagement Survey\n(Survey) and have done so for nearly two decades. The Survey results are reviewed\nby the Board and senior management and used to assist in reviewing the\nCorporation\u2019s human capital strategies, programs, initiatives, and practices. In\n2024, 87 percent of the Corporation\u2019s employees participated in the Survey, and\nour Employee Engagement Index, an overall measure of employee satisfaction with\nthe Corporation, was 84 percent. Our turnover among employees was stable at 8\npercent in both 2024 and 2023.\n\nRecognizing and Rewarding Performance Our compensation philosophy is to pay for\nperformance over the long term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance\nconsiderations encompass both financial and nonfinancial measures, including the\nmanner in which results are achieved. These considerations are designed to\nreinforce and promote Responsible Growth and align with our Risk Framework. We\nstrive to pay our employees based on market rates for their roles, experience and\nhow they perform. We regularly benchmark against other companies both within and\noutside our industry to confirm our pay is competitive. In 2021, the Corporation\nannounced it would increase its minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 per\nhour by 2025. In October 2024, as a next step towards that goal, the Corporation\nincreased its hourly minimum wage for U.S. employees to $24 per hour. In addition,\nin January 2025, for the eighth year since 2017, we announced that we recognized\nour teammates with Sharing Success compensation awards for their efforts during\n2024. Approximately 97 percent of employees globally will receive an award in the\nfirst quarter of 2025. The Corporation is committed to equal pay for equal work.\nWe maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our commitment, including\nreviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight from our Board and\nsenior management. Physical, Emotional, and Financial Wellness The Corporation is\ncommitted to providing employees with access to leading benefits and programs that\nhelp promote their physical, emotional and financial wellness. Investments we make\nin our teammates are designed to help them thrive, enabling them to better deliver\nfor our clients, communities and each other. In 2024, we continued our efforts to\nprovide affordable access to healthcare. Teammates enrolled in one of our national\nmedical plans were able to access virtual general medical and behavioral health\ncare at no cost. For the 12th year in a row, U.S. health insurance premiums\nremained unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000. We also recognize the\nimportance of emotional wellness. Globally, teammates and members of their\nhouseholds can utilize our Employee Assistance Programs for 12 in-person\nconfidential counseling sessions, and unlimited phone consultations at no cost.\nThe Corporation also offers comprehensive time-away policies and caregiving\nbenefits. Globally, teammates celebrating at least 15 years of continuous service\nwith the Corporation can participate in our paid Global Sabbatical Program. We\nsupport teammates in reaching financial wellness with retirement savings plans and\nother programs, along with access to self-guided financial planning tools and\nexpert advice.

Government Supervision and Regulation The following discussion describes,\namong other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to\nBHCs, financial holding companies, banks and broker-dealers, including specific\ninformation about Bank of America.\n                                                                                  \n  3Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to an extensive\nregulatory framework applicable to BHCs,\nfinancial holding companies and banks\nand other financial services entities.\nU.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs\nand financial holding companies is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and the Deposit Insurance\nFund (DIF) rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and\ncreditors. As a registered financial\nholding company and BHC, the Corporation\nis subject to the supervision of, and\nregular inspection by, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries (the Banks), organized as\nnational banking associations, are\nsubject to regulation, supervision and\nexamination by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC have adopted guidelines that\nestablish minimum standards for the\ndesign, implementation and board\noversight of BHCs\u2019 and national banks\u2019\nrisk governance frameworks. U.S.\nfinancial holding companies, and the\ncompanies under their control, are\npermitted to engage in activities\nconsidered \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d as\ndefined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nand related Federal Reserve\ninterpretations. The Corporation's\nstatus as a financial holding company is\nconditioned upon maintaining certain\neligibility requirements for both the\nCorporation and its U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiaries, including\nminimum capital ratios, supervisory\nratings and, in the case of the\ndepository institutions, at least\nsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act\nratings. Failure to be an eligible\nfinancial holding company could result\nin the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of\nAmerica's activities, including\npotential acquisitions. Additionally, we\nare subject to a significant number of\nlaws, rules and regulations (LRRs) that\ngovern our businesses in the U.S. and in\nthe other jurisdictions in which we\noperate, including permissible\nactivities, minimum levels of capital\nand liquidity, compliance risk\nmanagement, consumer products and sales\npractices, privacy, data protection,\nsustainability and executive\ncompensation, among others.\n\nThe scope of the LRRs and the intensity\nof the supervision to which we are\nsubject have continuously increased over\nthe years. In addition, the banking and\nfinancial services sector is subject to\nsubstantial regulatory enforcement and\nfines. We cannot assess whether or not\nthere will be any major changes in the\nregulatory environment and expect that\nour business will remain subject to\ncontinuing and extensive regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nWe are also subject to various other\nLRRs, as well as supervision and\nexamination by other regulatory\nagencies, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect our entities,\nmanagement and ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. For\ninstance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to both U.S. and\ninternational regulation, including\nsupervision by the SEC, Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority and New\nYork Stock Exchange, among others; our\nfutures commission merchant subsidiary\nsupporting commodities and derivatives\nbusinesses in the U.S. is subject to\nregulation by and supervision of the\nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC), National Futures\nAssociation, the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange, and in the case of the Banks,\ncertain banking regulators; our\ninsurance activities are subject to\nlicensing and regulation by state\ninsurance regulatory agencies; and our\nconsumer financial products and services\nare regulated by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB). In addition,\ncertain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries\nare also registered with the CFTC as\nswap dealers, and conditionally\nregistered with the SEC as security-\nbased swap dealers.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by various\nnon-U.S. regulators, including\ngovernments, securities exchanges,\nprudential regulators, central banks and\nother regulatory bodies, in the\njurisdictions in which those businesses\noperate. For example, our financial\nservices entities are subject to\nregulation in the United Kingdom (U.K.)\nby the Prudential Regulatory Authority\nand Financial Conduct Authority, in\nIreland by the European Central Bank\n(ECB) and the Central Bank of Ireland\nand in France by the ECB, Autorit\u00e9 de\nContr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and\nAutorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers.\n\nThe Corporation is also subject to\nextensive LRRs in the U.S. and in the\nother jurisdictions in which it operates\nregarding bribery and corruption, know-\nyour-customer requirements, anti-money\nlaundering, embargo programs and\neconomic sanctions. For example, we are\nsubject to the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act\n(BSA), which contains anti-money\nlaundering and financial transparency\nlaws designed to detect and deter money\nlaundering and the financing of\nterrorism, as well as record-keeping,\nreporting, due diligence and customer\nverification requirements, various\nsanctions programs administered and\nenforced by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) and foreign\njurisdictions, which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in\ncountries that are, involved in\nactivities, such as terrorism,\nhostilities, drug trafficking or human\nrights violations and the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the\nU.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt\nand illegal payments to government\nofficials and others. In 2024, federal\nregulators, including the Federal\nReserve and the OCC, proposed amendments\nto update the requirements for\nsupervised institutions to establish,\nimplement and maintain effective, risk-\nbased and reasonably designed anti-money\nlaundering programs, including the\nidentification, evaluation and\ndocumentation of money laundering risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Source of Strength                                                              \n                                                                                  \nUnder the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the\nFinancial Reform Act) and Federal\nReserve policy, BHCs are expected to act\nas a source of financial strength to\neach subsidiary bank and to commit\nresources to support each such\nsubsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-\nguarantee provisions of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the\nevent of a loss suffered or anticipated\nby the FDIC, either as a result of\ndefault of a bank subsidiary or related\nto FDIC assistance provided to such a\nsubsidiary in danger of default, the\naffiliate banks of such a subsidiary may\nbe assessed for the FDIC\u2019s loss, subject\nto certain exceptions.\n                                                                                  \n  Transactions with Affiliates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act, as implemented by\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the\nBanks are subject to restrictions that\nlimit certain types of transactions\nbetween the Banks and their nonbank\naffiliates. In general, U.S. banks are\nsubject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit,\npurchases of assets and certain other\ntransactions involving their nonbank\naffiliates. Additionally, transactions\nbetween U.S. banks and their nonbank\naffiliates are required to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America4                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Deposit Insurance                                                               \n                                                                                  \nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks\nare insured by the FDIC, subject to\nlimits and conditions of applicable law\nand the FDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant to\nthe Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance\ncoverage limits are $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank for each\naccount ownership category. All insured\ndepository institutions are required to\npay assessments to the FDIC in order to\nfund the DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain a\nstatutory minimum ratio of the DIF to\ninsured deposits in the U.S. of at least\n1.35 percent and has established a long-\nterm goal of a two percent DIF ratio. As\nof the date of this report, the DIF is\nbelow the statutory minimum ratio and\nthe FDIC\u2019s long-term goal. In October\n2022, the FDIC adopted a restoration\nplan that includes an increase in\ndeposit insurance assessments across the\nindustry of two basis points (bps). The\nFDIC has indicated that it intends to\nmaintain such assessment rates for the\nforeseeable future. Deposit insurance\nassessment rates are subject to change\nby the FDIC and will be impacted by the\noverall economy and the stability of the\nbanking industry as a whole. The FDIC\nalso has the authority to charge special\nassessments from time to time, including\nin connection with systemic risk events.\nFor example, in 2023, the FDIC issued\nits final rule to impose a special\nassessment to recover the loss to the\nDIF resulting from the closure of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nFor more information on the impact to\nthe Corporation of the FDIC special\nassessment, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.

These rules are\ncomplex and continue to evolve as U.S.\nand international regulatory authorities\npropose and enact amendments to these\nrules. The Corporation seeks to manage\nits capital position to maintain\nsufficient capital to satisfy these\nregulatory rules and to support our\nbusiness activities. These continually\nevolving rules are likely to influence\nour planning processes and may require\nadditional regulatory capital and\nliquidity, as well as impose additional\noperational and compliance costs on the\nCorporation.\n\nFor more information on regulatory\ncapital rules and capital composition,\nsee Capital Management on page 48, Note\n16 \u2013 Regulatory Requirements and\nRestrictions to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, which are\nincorporated by reference in this Item\n1, and Item 1A.

To the extent that the Federal\nReserve increases our stress\n\ncapital buffer (SCB), global\nsystemically important bank (G-SIB)\nsurcharge or countercyclical capital\nbuffer, our returns of capital to\nshareholders, including dividends and\ncommon stock repurchases, could\ndecrease. As part of its CCAR, the\nFederal Reserve conducts stress testing\non parts of our business using\nhypothetical economic scenarios prepared\nby the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios\nmay affect our CCAR stress test results,\nwhich may impact the level of our SCB.\nFor example, based on the results of our\n2024 CCAR stress test, the Corporation\u2019s\nSCB increased to 3.2 percent.\nAdditionally, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge increased to 3.0 percent on\nJanuary 1, 2024. The Federal Reserve\ncould also impose limitations or\nprohibitions on taking capital actions\nsuch as paying or increasing dividends\nor repurchasing common stock, including\nas a result of economic disruptions or\nevents.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that a bank\nis not \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or \u201cwell-\nmanaged,\u201d the bank\u2019s BHC would be\nrequired to enter into an agreement with\nthe Federal Reserve to comply with all\napplicable capital and management\nrequirements, which may contain\nadditional limitations or conditions\nrelating to its activities.\nAdditionally, the applicable federal\nregulatory authority is authorized to\ndetermine, under certain circumstances\nrelating to the financial condition of a\nbank or BHC, that the payment of\ndividends would be an unsafe or unsound\npractice and to prohibit payment\nthereof.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. The\nrights of the Corporation, our\nshareholders and our creditors to\nparticipate in any distribution of the\nassets or earnings of our subsidiaries\nare further subject to the prior claims\nof creditors of the respective\nsubsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding\ndistributions, including the minimum\ncapital requirements, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity and Note 16 \u2013\nRegulatory Requirements and Restrictions\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                                  \n  Resolution Planning                                                             \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion\nof assets, every two years the\nCorporation is required by the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC to submit a plan\nfor a rapid and orderly resolution in\nthe event of material financial distress\nor failure.\n\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a\ndetailed roadmap for the orderly\nresolution of the BHC, including the\ncontinued operations or solvent wind\ndown of its material entities, pursuant\nto the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or\nmore hypothetical scenarios assuming no\nextraordinary government assistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\ndetermine that the BHC\u2019s plan is not\ncredible, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC may jointly impose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on growth,\nactivities or operations. A summary of\nour plan is available on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of\na resolution plan for Bank of America,\nNational Association (BANA), which must\ndescribe how the insured depository\ninstitution would be resolved under the\nbank resolution provisions of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. A\ndescription of this plan is available on\nthe FDIC\u2019s website.\n                                                                                  \n  5Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe continue to make progress to enhance\nour resolvability, which includes\ncontinued improvements to our\npreparedness and exercise capabilities\nto implement our resolution plan, both\nfrom a financial and operational\nstandpoint.\n\nAcross international jurisdictions,\nresolution planning is the\nresponsibility of national resolution\nauthorities (RA) and central resolution\nauthorities (CA). Among those, the\njurisdictions with the greatest impact\nto the Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries are\nthe U.K., Ireland, France, Mexico, Hong\nKong, Indonesia, the Philippines and\nMalaysia where rules have been issued\nrequiring the submission of significant\ninformation about locally incorporated\nsubsidiaries as well as the\nCorporation\u2019s banking branches located\nin those jurisdictions that are deemed\nto be material for resolution planning\npurposes. As a result of the RA\u2019s and\nCA's review of the submitted\ninformation, we could be required to\ntake certain actions over the next\nseveral years that could increase\noperating costs and potentially result\nin the restructuring of certain\nbusinesses and subsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Liquidity on page 9.\n                                                                                  \n  Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority                                \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nthe FDIC may be appointed receiver of an\ninsured depository institution if it is\ninsolvent or in certain other\ncircumstances. In addition, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nsystemically important financial\ninstitution (SIFI) such as the\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such institution. In the\nevent of such appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things, invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, instead\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury makes certain\nfinancial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. The orderly liquidation\nauthority is modeled in part on the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, but also\nadopts certain concepts from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority\ncontains certain differences from the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in\ncertain circumstances, the FDIC could\npermit payment of obligations it\ndetermines to be systemically\nsignificant (e.g., short-term creditors\nor operating creditors) in lieu of\npaying other obligations (e.g., long-\nterm creditors) without the need to\nobtain creditors\u2019 consent or prior court\nreview. The insolvency and resolution\nprocess could also lead to a large\nreduction or total elimination of the\nvalue of a BHC\u2019s outstanding equity, as\nwell as impairment or elimination of\ncertain debt.\n\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC\ncould replace a distressed BHC with a\nbridge holding company, which could\ncontinue operations and result in an\norderly resolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity is held solely\nfor the benefit of creditors of the\noriginal BHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve\nrequires that BHCs maintain minimum\nlevels of long-term debt required to\nprovide adequate loss absorbing capacity\nin the event of a resolution.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution, see Item 1A.

At\nJune 30, 2024, we held greater than 10\npercent of the total amount of deposits\nof insured depository institutions in\nthe U.S.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act\nrestricts acquisitions by a financial\ninstitution if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial institution would exceed\n10 percent of the total liabilities of\nall financial institutions in the U.S.\nAt June 30, 2024, our liabilities did\nnot exceed 10 percent of the total\nliabilities of all financial\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n                                                                                  \n  The Volcker Rule                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured\ndepository institutions and companies\naffiliated with insured depository\ninstitutions (collectively, banking\nentities) from engaging in short-term\nproprietary trading of certain\nsecurities, derivatives, commodity\nfutures and options for their own\naccount. The Volcker Rule also imposes\nlimits on banking entities\u2019 investments\nin, and other relationships with, hedge\nfunds and private equity funds. The\nVolcker Rule provides exemptions for\ncertain activities, including market\nmaking, underwriting, hedging, trading\nin government obligations, insurance\ncompany activities and organizing and\noffering hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies\nthat certain activities are not\nprohibited, including acting as agent,\nbroker or custodian. A banking entity\nwith significant trading operations,\nsuch as the Corporation, is required to\nmaintain a detailed compliance program\nto comply with the restrictions of the\nVolcker Rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivatives                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nOur derivatives businesses are subject\nto extensive regulation globally,\nincluding under the Financial Reform\nAct, the European Union (EU) Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive and\nRegulation, the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation, analogous\nU.K. regulatory regimes and similar\nregulatory regimes in other\njurisdictions. These regulations, among\nother things, require clearing and\nexchange trading of certain derivatives,\nestablish capital, margin, reporting,\nregistration and business conduct\nrequirements for certain market\nparticipants, set position limits on\ncertain derivatives and set out\nderivatives trading transparency\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions,\nincluding the U.S., EU, U.K., and Japan,\nhave adopted resolution stay regulations\nto address concerns that the close-out\nof derivatives and other financial\ncontracts could impede orderly\nresolution of G-SIBs, and additional\njurisdictions are expected to follow\nsuit. Generally, these regulations\nrequire amendment of certain financial\ncontracts to provide for contractual\nrecognition of stays of termination\nrights under various statutory\nresolution regimes and a stay on the\nexercise of cross-default rights based\non an affiliate\u2019s entry into insolvency\nproceedings. Resolution regulations may\nalso require contractual recognition by\nthe counterparty that amounts owed to\nthem may be written down or converted\ninto equity as part of a bail in.

These existing and evolving\nlegal requirements in the U.S. and\nabroad, as well as court proceedings and\nchanging guidance from regulatory\nbodies, including the validity of cross-\nborder data transfer mechanisms from the\nEU and other jurisdictions, continue to\nlend uncertainty to privacy compliance\nglobally.\n\nAdditionally, the Corporation is subject\nto evolving information security\n(including cybersecurity) LRRs enacted\nby U.S. federal and state governments\nand non-U.S. jurisdictions, including\nrequirements to develop cybersecurity\nprograms, policies and frameworks, as\nwell as provide disclosure and/or\nnotifications of certain cybersecurity\nincidents and data breaches.\n                                                                                  \n  7Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1A.  Risk FactorsThe discussion below addresses our material risk        \u2502\n\u2502  factors of which we are aware. Any risk factor, either by itself or together  \u2502\n\u2502  with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our            \u2502\n\u2502  businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.     \u2502\n\u2502  References to third parties may include suppliers, service providers,         \u2502\n\u2502  counterparties, financial market utilities, exchanges and clearing houses,    \u2502\n\u2502  data aggregators and other partners and their upstream and downstream         \u2502\n\u2502  service providers (e.g., fourth parties, fifth parties) who may also          \u2502\n\u2502  contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we   \u2502\n\u2502  currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses,         \u2502\n\u2502  results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Therefore, the  \u2502\n\u2502  risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that   \u2502\n\u2502  we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk   \u2502\n\u2502  in the MD&A beginning on page 45. For more information about the risks        \u2502\n\u2502  contained in this section, see Item 1. Business beginning on page 2, MD&A     \u2502\n\u2502  beginning on page 26 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements           \u2502\n\u2502  beginning on page 94.MarketWe may be adversely affected by the financial      \u2502\n\u2502  markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic              \u2502\n\u2502  conditions.General economic, political, social and health conditions in the   \u2502\n\u2502  U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our businesses. In particular,   \u2502\n\u2502  global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest        \u2502\n\u2502  rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross      \u2502\n\u2502  domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation,     \u2502\n\u2502  supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor         \u2502\n\u2502  shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal      \u2502\n\u2502  government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property         \u2502\n\u2502  values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or     \u2502\n\u2502  class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global      \u2502\n\u2502  markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or    \u2502\n\u2502  global banking industry, including bank failures, the failure of nonbank      \u2502\n\u2502  financial institutions and liquidity concerns, fluctuations or other          \u2502\n\u2502  significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies,   \u2502\n\u2502  the transition of benchmark rates to alternative reference rates, the impact  \u2502\n\u2502  of the volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the rate of        \u2502\n\u2502  growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and     \u2502\n\u2502  cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or    \u2502\n\u2502  energy infrastructure, recessionary fears, investor sentiment and the U.S.    \u2502\n\u2502  and global election cycles, including stated, perceived or actual changes to  \u2502\n\u2502  policy and the geopolitical environment. Global markets, including energy     \u2502\n\u2502  and commodity markets, may also be adversely affected by the current or       \u2502\n\u2502  anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather    \u2502\n\u2502  events or natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies   \u2502\n\u2502  or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflicts, terrorism, or other           \u2502\n\u2502  geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements   \u2502\n\u2502  and liquidity.Any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the     \u2502\n\u2502  above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income  \u2502\n\u2502  and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and     \u2502\n\u2502  financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. Elevated         \u2502\n\u2502  inflation and interest rate levels, monetary tightening by central banks,     \u2502\n\u2502  and geopolitical developments, including the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the  \u2502\n\u2502  conflicts in the Middle East, have adversely impacted and could continue to   \u2502\n\u2502  adversely impact financial markets and                                        \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  macroeconomic conditions, as well as result in additional market volatility   \u2502\n\u2502  and disruptions and recessionary risk.Global uncertainties regarding fiscal   \u2502\n\u2502  and monetary policies present economic challenges. High and rising debt       \u2502\n\u2502  levels in the U.S. and globally may contribute to interest rate volatility,   \u2502\n\u2502  which may constrain governments\u2019 fiscal policies, potentially resulting in    \u2502\n\u2502  adverse economic outcomes. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or central    \u2502\n\u2502  banks in other jurisdictions, including changes in target rates, balance      \u2502\n\u2502  sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and           \u2502\n\u2502  difficult to predict, particularly regarding inflation, due to the            \u2502\n\u2502  uncertainty of inflationary paths. This can affect interest rates and the     \u2502\n\u2502  value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities,     \u2502\n\u2502  and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may   \u2502\n\u2502  also raise government debt levels, adversely affect businesses and household  \u2502\n\u2502  incomes, adversely impact the banking sector generally, and increase          \u2502\n\u2502  uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. Monetary policy has contributed to   \u2502\n\u2502  and may continue to result in elevated market interest rates and a flat       \u2502\n\u2502  and/or inverted yield curve. Any increases in policy rates, as a response to  \u2502\n\u2502  inflation persistently above central bank targets, changes to fiscal or       \u2502\n\u2502  trade policies, or otherwise, could result in higher market interest rates.   \u2502\n\u2502  Elevated or rising interest rates may continue to result in volatility of     \u2502\n\u2502  equity and other markets, and volatility of the U.S. dollar, which could      \u2502\n\u2502  impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing       \u2502\n\u2502  delinquency rates. Financial market volatility could also result from         \u2502\n\u2502  uncertainty about the timing and extent of any additional rate cuts by the    \u2502\n\u2502  Federal Reserve in response to moderating inflation and/or weakening          \u2502\n\u2502  economic conditions. Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal      \u2502\n\u2502  Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in     \u2502\n\u2502  lower interest rates would typically result in lower revenue through lower    \u2502\n\u2502  net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of              \u2502\n\u2502  operations.Also, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and    \u2502\n\u2502  evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation,         \u2502\n\u2502  taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including       \u2502\n\u2502  efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely  \u2502\n\u2502  impact U.S. or global economic activity and our clients\u2019, our                 \u2502\n\u2502  counterparties\u2019 and our earnings and operations. Globally, although many      \u2502\n\u2502  central banks have begun to remove monetary restriction, policy rates in      \u2502\n\u2502  many countries remain at elevated levels. While higher interest rates have    \u2502\n\u2502  generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, they have         \u2502\n\u2502  negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment        \u2502\n\u2502  securities, deposits, loan demand and funding costs. In addition to higher    \u2502\n\u2502  interest rates, wider credit spreads can negatively impact capital and/or     \u2502\n\u2502  liquidity by reducing the value of debt securities. High and rising federal   \u2502\n\u2502  debt levels, investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal trajectory, changes to   \u2502\n\u2502  fiscal policy and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to     \u2502\n\u2502  lower investor appetite for U.S. debt securities, higher interest rates and   \u2502\n\u2502  financial market volatility, potentially impacting broader economic           \u2502\n\u2502  activity. Further, if the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling limit is not raised  \u2502\n\u2502  timely, the ramifications may result in market volatility, ratings            \u2502\n\u2502  downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions.      \u2502\n\u2502  This could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and      \u2502\n\u2502  world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest    \u2502\n\u2502  rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to  \u2502\n\u2502  U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.Changes to international trade and      \u2502\n\u2502  investment policies by the U.S. or other countries, and the uncertainty       \u2502\n\u2502  about potential changes, could negatively impact financial markets globally.  \u2502\n\u2502  Significant increases in tariff rates, either broadly applied or              \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America8                                                                \n                                                                                  \ntargeted at specific goods or trading\npartners, including Canada, Latin\nAmerica and the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (China), could adversely impact\neconomic conditions and/or result in\nhigher inflation, which could result in\nfinancial market volatility as markets\nadjust to the incremental cost of doing\nbusiness and/or new business models to\nreduce the impacts, as well as adversely\nimpact asset prices. Also, escalation of\ntensions between the U.S. and China,\nincluding tariff increases, could lead\nto further U.S. measures that adversely\naffect financial markets, disrupt world\ntrade and commerce and lead to trade\nretaliation, including through the use\nof counter tariffs, foreign exchange\nmeasures or the large-scale sale of U.S.\nTreasury bonds. Any restrictions on the\nactivities of businesses, could also\nnegatively affect financial markets.\n\nThese developments could adversely\naffect our businesses, clients,\nincluding demand for our products and\nservices, our market-making activities,\nour and our clients\u2019 securities and\nderivatives portfolios, including the\nrisk of lower re-investment rates in\nthose portfolios, our level of charge-\noffs and provision for credit losses,\nthe carrying value of our deferred tax\nassets, our capital levels, our\nliquidity and our results of operations.\n\nIncreased market volatility and adverse\nchanges in financial or capital market\nconditions may increase our market risk.\n\nOur liquidity, competitive position,\nbusiness, results of operations and\nfinancial condition are affected by\nmarket risks such as changes in interest\nand currency exchange rates,\nfluctuations in equity, commodity and\nfutures prices, trading volumes and\nprices of securitized products, the\nimplied volatility of interest rates and\ncredit spreads and other economic and\nbusiness factors. These market risks may\nadversely affect, among other things,\nthe value of our securities, including\nour on- and off-balance sheet\nsecurities, trading assets and other\nfinancial instruments, the cost of debt\ncapital and our access to credit\nmarkets, the value of assets under\nmanagement (AUM), fee income relating to\nAUM, client allocation of capital among\ninvestment alternatives, the volume of\nclient activity in our trading\noperations, investment banking,\nunderwriting and other capital market\nfees and the general profitability and\nrisk level of the transactions in which\nwe engage and our competitiveness with\nrespect to deposit pricing. The value of\ncertain of our assets is sensitive to\nchanges in market interest rates and/or\nspreads. If the Federal Reserve or a\nnon-U.S. central bank changes or signals\na change in monetary policy, market\ninterest rates or credit spreads could\nbe affected, which could adversely\nimpact the value of such assets. Changes\nto fiscal policy, including expansion of\nU.S. federal deficit spending and\nresultant debt issuance, could also\naffect market interest rates. If\ninterest rates decrease, our results of\noperations could be negatively impacted,\nincluding future revenue and earnings\ngrowth.\n\nOur models and strategies to assess and\ncontrol our market risk exposures are\nsubject to inherent limitations. In\ntimes of market stress or other\nunforeseen circumstances, previously\nuncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Such changes to the\nrelationship between market parameters\nmay limit the effectiveness of our\nhedging strategies and cause us to incur\nsignificant losses. Changes in\ncorrelation can be exacerbated where\nmarket participants use risk or trading\nmodels with assumptions or algorithms\nsimilar to ours. In these and other\ncases, it may be difficult to reduce our\nrisk positions due to activity of other\nmarket participants or widespread market\ndislocations, including circumstances\nwhere asset values are declining\nsignificantly or no market exists. Where\nwe own securities that do not have an\nestablished liquid trading market or are\notherwise subject to restrictions on\nsale or hedging, or\n\nwhere the degree of accessible liquidity\ndeclines significantly, we may not be\nable to reduce our positions and risks\nassociated with such holdings, so we may\nsuffer larger than expected losses when\nadverse price movements take place. This\nrisk can be exacerbated where we hold a\nposition that is large relative to the\navailable liquidity.\n\nIf asset values decline, we may incur\nlosses and negative impacts, including\nto capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of financial\ninstruments, including loans and loan\ncommitments, securities financing\nagreements, asset-backed secured\nfinancings, derivative assets and\nliabilities, debt securities, marketable\nequity securities and certain other\nassets and liabilities that we measure\nat fair value and are subject to\nvaluation and impairment assessments. We\ndetermine these values based on\napplicable accounting guidance, which,\nfor financial instruments measured at\nfair value, requires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price and to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs\nin fair value measurements. The fair\nvalues of these financial instruments\ninclude adjustments for market\nliquidity, credit quality, funding\nimpact on certain derivatives and other\ntransaction-specific factors, where\nappropriate.\n\nGains or losses on these instruments can\nhave a direct impact on our results of\noperations, unless we have effectively\nmitigated the risk of our exposures.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause\ndecreases in residential mortgage loan\noriginations and could impact the\norigination of corporate debt. In\naddition, increases in interest rates or\nchanges in spreads may continue to\nadversely impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities and, accordingly, for\ndebt securities classified as available-\nfor-sale (AFS), adversely affect\naccumulated other comprehensive income\nand, thus, our capital levels. Increases\nin interest rates or changes in spreads\ncould also adversely impact our\nregulatory liquidity position and\nrequirements, which include eligible AFS\ndebt securities and held-to-maturity\n(HTM) debt securities. As our liquidity\nis dependent on the fair value of these\nassets, increases in market interest\nrates and/or wider spreads, have\nadversely impacted and may continue to\nadversely impact the fair value of debt\nsecurities, adversely affecting\nliquidity levels.\n\nFair values may be impacted by declining\nvalues of the underlying assets or the\nprices at which observable market\ntransactions occur and the continued\navailability of these transactions or\nindices. The financial strength of\ncounterparties, with whom we have\neconomically hedged some of our exposure\nto these assets, also will affect the\nfair value of these assets. Sudden\ndeclines and volatility in the prices of\nassets may curtail or eliminate trading\nactivities in these assets, which may\nmake it difficult to sell, hedge or\nvalue these assets. The inability to\nsell or effectively hedge assets reduces\nour ability to limit losses in such\npositions, and the difficulty in valuing\nassets may increase our risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), which requires us to\nmaintain additional capital and\nincreases our funding costs. Values of\nAUM also impact revenues in our wealth\nmanagement and related advisory\nbusinesses for asset-based management\nand performance fees. Declines in values\nof AUM can result in lower fees earned\nfor managing such assets.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nIf we are unable to access the capital\nmarkets, have prolonged net deposits\noutflows, or our borrowing costs\nincrease, our liquidity and competitive\nposition will be negatively affected.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our\nbusinesses. We fund our assets primarily\nwith globally sourced deposits in our\nbank entities, as well as secured and\nunsecured liabilities transacted in the\ncapital markets. We rely on certain\nsecured funding sources,\n                                                                                  \n  9Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nsuch as repo markets, which are\ntypically short-term and credit-\nsensitive. We also engage in asset\nsecuritization transactions, including\nwith the government-sponsored\nenterprises (GSEs), to help fund a\nportion of our consumer lending\nactivities. Our liquidity could be\nadversely affected by any inability to\naccess the capital markets, illiquidity\nor volatility in the capital markets,\nthe decrease in value of eligible\ncollateral or increased collateral\nrequirements (including as a result of\ncredit concerns for short-term\nborrowing), changes to our relationships\nwith our funding providers based on real\nor perceived changes in our risk\nprofile, prolonged federal government\nshutdowns, or uncertainties regarding\nthe impact of GSE privatization, should\nit occur.\n\nAlso, our liquidity or cost of funds may\nbe negatively impacted by the\nunwillingness or inability of the\nFederal Reserve to act as lender of last\nresort, unexpected simultaneous draws on\nlines of credit or deposits, slower\nclient payment rates, restricted access\nto the assets of prime brokerage\nclients, the withdrawal of or failure to\nattract client deposits or invested\nfunds (e.g., from attrition driven by\nclients seeking higher yielding deposits\nor securities products, desiring to\nutilize an alternative financial\ninstitution perceived to be safer,\nchanging spending behavior due to\ninflation, decline in the economy or\nother drivers resulting in an increased\nneed for cash), increased regulatory\nliquidity, capital and margin\nrequirements for our U.S. or\ninternational banks and their nonbank\nsubsidiaries, which could result in the\ninability to transfer liquidity\ninternally, changes in patterns of\nintraday liquidity usage resulting from\na counterparty or technology failure or\nother idiosyncratic event or failure,\nthe default by a significant market\nparticipant or third party (including\nclearing agents, custodians, central\nbanks or central counterparty\nclearinghouses (CCPs)) or the inability\nto sell assets due to illiquid markets\n(e.g., no market exists or market\nsaturation). These factors may increase\nour borrowing costs and negatively\nimpact our liquidity.\n\nSeveral of these factors may arise due\nto circumstances beyond our control,\nsuch as general market volatility,\ndisruption, shock or stress, stress in\nsovereign debt markets, the emergence of\nwidespread health emergencies or\npandemics and geopolitical events and/or\nturmoil (including military conflicts,\nsuch as the Russia/Ukraine conflict and\nthe conflicts in the Middle East, or any\npotential escalation of such conflicts).\nFederal Reserve policy decisions\n(including fluctuations in interest\nrates or Federal Reserve balance sheet\ncomposition), negative views or loss of\nconfidence about us or the financial\nservices industry generally or due to a\nspecific news event (e.g., regional bank\nfailures), changes in the regulatory\nenvironment or governmental fiscal or\nmonetary policies, actions by credit\nrating agencies or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties or\nus. The impact of these potentially\nsudden events, whether within our\ncontrol or not, could include an\ninability to sell assets or redeem\ninvestments, unforeseen outflows of\ncash, the need to draw on liquidity\nfacilities, the reduction of financing\nbalances and the loss of equity secured\nfunding, debt repurchases to support the\nsecondary market or meet client\nrequests, the need for additional\nfunding for commitments and\ncontingencies and unexpected collateral\ncalls, among other things, the result of\nwhich could be increased costs, a\nliquidity shortfall and/or impact on our\nliquidity coverage ratio.\n\nOur liquidity and cost of funds may be\nimpacted by our reputation risk,\ninvestor behavior and confidence, debt\nmarket disruption, firm specific\nconcerns or prevailing market\nconditions, including changes in\ninterest and currency exchange rates,\nsignificant fluctuations in equity and\nfutures prices, lower trading volumes\nand prices of securitized products and\nour credit spreads. Increases in\ninterest rates and our credit\n\nspreads can increase the cost of our\nfunding and result in mark-to-market or\ncredit valuation adjustment exposures.\nChanges in our credit spreads are market\ndriven and may be influenced by market\nperceptions of our creditworthiness,\nincluding changes in our credit ratings\nor changes in broader financial market\nand macroeconomic conditions. Changes to\ninterest rates and our credit spreads\noccur continuously and may be\nunpredictable and highly volatile. We\nmay also experience net interest margin\ncompression from offering higher than\nexpected deposit rates in order to\nattract and maintain deposits.\nConcentrations within our funding\nprofile, such as maturities, currencies\nor counterparties, can also reduce our\nfunding efficiency.\n\nReduction in our credit ratings could\nlimit our access to funding or the\ncapital markets, increase borrowing\ncosts or trigger additional collateral\nor funding requirements.\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise\nfunds are directly impacted by our\ncredit ratings. Credit ratings are also\nimportant to investors, clients or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and seek to engage in\ncertain transactions, including over-\nthe-counter (OTC) derivatives. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by rating agencies, which\nconsider a number of financial and\nnonfinancial factors, including our\nfranchise, financial strength,\nperformance and prospects, management,\ngovernance, risk management practices,\ncapital adequacy, asset quality and\noperations, among other criteria, as\nwell as factors not under our control,\nsuch as regulatory developments, the\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment and changes to rating\nmethodologies.\n\nRating agencies could adjust our credit\nratings at any time and there can be no\nassurance as to whether or when a\ndowngrade could occur. Any reduction\ncould result in a wider credit spread\nand negatively affect our access to\ncredit markets, the related cost of\nfunds, our businesses and certain\ntrading revenues, particularly in those\nbusinesses where counterparty\ncreditworthiness is critical. If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our parent\ncompany, bank or broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were downgraded, we may\nexperience loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing,\nand/or incur increased cost of funds and\nincreased collateral requirements. Under\nthe terms of certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements,\nif our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings are downgraded, the\ncounterparties may require additional\ncollateral or terminate these contracts\nor agreements.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nconsequences of a credit rating\ndowngrade are inherently uncertain and\ndepend upon numerous dynamic, complex\nand inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including the relationship\nbetween long-term and short-term credit\nratings and the behaviors of clients,\ninvestors and counterparties.\n\nBank of America Corporation is a holding\ncompany, is dependent on its\nsubsidiaries for liquidity and may be\nrestricted from transferring funds from\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America Corporation, as the\nparent company, is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and\nmanage liquidity on a legal entity\nbasis. Legal entity liquidity is an\nimportant consideration as there are\nlegal, regulatory, contractual and other\nlimitations on our ability to utilize\nliquidity from one legal entity to\nsatisfy the liquidity requirements of\nanother, including the parent company,\nwhich could result in adverse liquidity\nevents. The parent company depends on\ndividends, distributions, loans and\nother payments from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries to fund dividend payments\non our preferred stock and common stock\nand to fund all payments on our other\nobligations, including debt obligations.\nAny inability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America10                                                               \n                                                                                  \npay dividends or make payments to us may\nadversely affect our cash flow,\nliquidity and financial condition.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. Our bank\nand broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to restrictions on their ability\nto lend or transact with affiliates,\nminimum regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements and restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited with them\nin bank or brokerage accounts to fund\ntheir businesses. Intercompany\narrangements we entered into in\nconnection with our resolution planning\nsubmissions could restrict the amount of\nfunding available to the parent company\nfrom our subsidiaries under certain\nadverse conditions.\n\nAdditional restrictions on transactions\nwith certain related parties, increased\ncapital and liquidity requirements and\nadditional limitations on the use of\nfunds on deposit in bank or brokerage\naccounts, as well as lower earnings, can\nreduce the amount of funds available to\nmeet the obligations of the parent\ncompany and may require the parent\ncompany to provide additional funding to\nsuch subsidiaries. Regulatory action\nthat requires additional liquidity at\neach of our subsidiaries could impede\naccess to funds we need to pay our\nobligations or pay dividends. In\naddition, our right to participate in a\ndistribution of assets upon a\nsubsidiary\u2019s liquidation or\nreorganization is subject to prior\nclaims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\nBank of America Corporation\u2019s liquidity\nand financial condition, and the ability\nto pay dividends and obligations, could\nbe adversely affected in the event of a\nresolution.\n\nBank of America Corporation, our parent\nholding company, is required to submit a\nplan to the FDIC and Federal Reserve\nevery two years describing its\nresolution strategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. Bank of\nAmerica Corporation\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy is a \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy, whereby only the\nparent holding company would file for\nbankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. Certain key operating subsidiaries\nwould be provided with sufficient\ncapital and liquidity to operate through\nsevere stress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue operating or be\nwound down in a solvent manner following\na bankruptcy of the parent holding\ncompany. Bank of America Corporation has\nentered into intercompany arrangements\nresulting in the contribution of most of\nits capital and liquidity to key\nsubsidiaries. Pursuant to these\narrangements, if Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nbecomes imminent, it will no longer be\nable to draw liquidity from its key\nsubsidiaries and will be required to\ncontribute its remaining financial\nassets to a wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary. This could adversely affect\nour liquidity and financial condition,\nincluding the ability to meet our\npayment obligations, and our ability to\npay dividends and/or repurchase our\ncommon stock.\n\nIf the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly\ndetermine that Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s resolution plan is not\ncredible, they could impose more\nstringent capital or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or operations. We\ncould also be required to take certain\nactions that could impose operating\ncosts and result in the divestiture of\nassets or restructuring of businesses\nand subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a G-SIB such as Bank of America\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver to conduct an orderly\nliquidation, and could, among other\nthings, invoke the orderly liquidation\nauthority, instead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the\nTreasury makes certain\n\nfinancial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. Also, the FDIC could\nreplace Bank of America Corporation with\na bridge holding company, which could\ncontinue operations and result in an\norderly resolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity would be held\nsolely for the benefit of our creditors.\nThe FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy may result in our security\nholders suffering greater losses than\nwould have been the case under a\nbankruptcy proceeding or a different\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Corporation is resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC\u2019s\norderly liquidation authority, third-\nparty creditors of our subsidiaries may\nreceive significant or full recoveries\non their claims, while security holders\nof Bank of America Corporation could\nface significant or complete losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nEconomic or market disruptions and\ninsufficient credit loss reserves may\nresult in a higher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nA number of our products expose us to\ncredit risk, including loans, letters of\ncredit, derivatives, debt securities,\ntrading account assets and assets held-\nfor-sale. Deterioration in the financial\ncondition of our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral could adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nOur credit portfolios may be impacted by\nU.S. and global macroeconomic and market\nconditions, events and disruptions,\nincluding declines in GDP, consumer\nspending or property values, asset price\ncorrections, increasing consumer and\ncorporate leverage, increases in\ncorporate bond spreads, government\nshutdowns or policies such as tax\nchanges, changes in international trade\npolicy including tariff rates, rising or\nelevated unemployment levels, elevated\ninflation or cost of living expenses,\nfluctuations in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates, as well as the emergence\nof widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, extreme weather events and\nthe impacts of climate change, including\nacute and/or chronic extreme weather\nevents and efforts to transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. Significant economic\nor market stresses and disruptions\ntypically have a negative impact on the\nbusiness environment and financial\nmarkets, which could impact the\nunderlying credit quality of our\nborrowers, counterparties and assets.\nProperty value declines or asset price\ncorrections could increase the risk of\nborrowers or counterparties defaulting\nor becoming delinquent in their\nobligations to us, and could decrease\nthe value of the collateral we hold,\nwhich could increase credit losses.\nCredit risk could also be magnified by\nlending to leveraged borrowers or\ndeclining asset prices, including\nproperty or collateral values, unrelated\nto macroeconomic stress. Simultaneous\ndrawdowns on lines of credit and/or an\nincrease in a borrower\u2019s leverage in a\nweakening economic environment, or\notherwise, could result in deterioration\nin our credit portfolio, should\nborrowers be unable to fulfill competing\nfinancial obligations. Increased\ndelinquency and default rates could\nadversely affect our credit portfolios\nand increase charge-offs and provisions\nfor credit losses.\n\nA recessionary environment and/or a rise\nin unemployment could adversely impact\nthe ability of our consumer and/or\ncommercial borrowers or counterparties\nto meet their financial obligations and\nnegatively impact our credit portfolio.\nConsumers have been and may continue to\nbe negatively impacted by inflation\nand/or a higher cost of living,\nresulting in drawdowns of savings or\nincreases in household debt. Elevated\ninterest rates, which have increased\ndebt servicing costs for some businesses\nand households, may adversely impact\ncredit quality, particularly in a\nrecessionary environment. Certain\nsectors also remain at risk (e.g.,\ncommercial real estate,\n                                                                                  \n  11Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nparticularly office) as a result of\nshifts in demand and tight financial and\ncredit conditions. Globally, conditions\nof slow growth or recession could\nfurther contribute to weaker credit\nconditions. If the macroeconomic\nenvironment or certain sectors worsen,\nour credit portfolio, net charge-offs,\nprovision and allowance for credit\nlosses could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe establish an allowance for credit\nlosses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments, based\non management's best estimate of\nlifetime expected credit losses (ECL)\ninherent in our relevant financial\nassets. The process to determine the\nallowance for credit losses uses models\nand assumptions that require us to make\ndifficult and complex judgments that are\noften interrelated, including\nforecasting how borrowers or\ncounterparties may perform in changing\neconomic conditions. The ability of our\nborrowers or counterparties to repay\ntheir obligations may be impacted by\nchanges in future economic conditions,\nwhich in turn could impact the accuracy\nof our loss forecasts and allowance\nestimates. There is also the possibility\nthat we have failed or will fail to\naccurately identify the appropriate\neconomic indicators or accurately\nestimate their impacts to our borrowers\nor counterparties, which could impact\nthe accuracy of our loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates.\n\nIf the models, estimates and assumptions\nwe use to establish reserves or the\njudgments we make in extending credit to\nour borrowers or counterparties, which\nare more sensitive due to the current\nuncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment, prove inaccurate in\npredicting future events, we may suffer\nlosses in excess of our ECL. In\naddition, changes to external factors\ncan negatively impact our recognition of\ncredit losses in our portfolios and\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is our\nbest estimate of ECL, but there is no\nguarantee that it will be sufficient to\naddress credit losses, particularly if\nthe economic outlook deteriorates\nsignificantly, quickly or unexpectedly.\nAs circumstances change, we may increase\nour allowance, which would reduce\nearnings. If economic conditions worsen,\nimpacting our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral, and credit losses are\nunexpectedly worse, we may increase our\nprovision for credit losses, which could\nadversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nOur concentrations of credit risk could\nadversely affect our credit losses,\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nWe may be subject to concentrations of\ncredit risk because of a common\ncharacteristic or common sensitivity to\neconomic, financial, public health or\nbusiness developments. Concentrations of\ncredit risk may reside in a particular\nindustry, geography, product, asset\nclass, counterparty or within any pool\nof exposures with a common risk\ncharacteristic. A deterioration in the\nfinancial condition or prospects of a\nparticular industry, geographic\nlocation, product or asset class, or a\nfailure or downgrade of, or default by,\nany particular entity or group of\nentities could negatively affect our\nbusinesses, and it is possible our\nlimits and credit monitoring exposure\ncontrols will not function as\nanticipated.\n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions\nand have significant credit\nconcentrations with respect to the\nfinancial services industry,\npredominantly comprised of broker-\ndealers, commercial banks, investment\nbanks, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds, CCPs and other\ninstitutional clients. Financial\nservices institutions and other\ncounterparties are inter-related because\nof trading, funding, clearing or other\nrelationships. Defaults by one or more\ncounterparties, or market uncertainty\nabout the financial stability of one or\nmore financial services institutions, or\nthe financial services industry\ngenerally,\n\ncould lead to market-wide liquidity\ndisruptions, losses, defaults and\nrelated disputes and litigation.\n\nOur credit risk may also be heightened\nby market risk when the collateral held\nby us cannot be liquidated or is\nliquidated at prices not sufficient to\nrecover the full amount of the loan or\nderivatives exposure, which may occur\nfrom events that impact the value of the\ncollateral, such as a sudden change in\nasset price or fraud. Disputes with\nobligors as to the valuation of\ncollateral could increase with\nsignificant market stress, volatility or\nilliquidity, and we could suffer losses\nif we are unable to realize the fair\nvalue of the collateral or manage\ndeclines in the value of collateral.\nAlso, our counterparty credit risk can\nincrease if margin posted by\ncounterparties is insufficient to cover\nexposures and elevated counterparty\nexposure is accompanied by the\ncounterparty\u2019s likelihood of default.\n\nWe have concentrations of credit risk,\nincluding with respect to our consumer\nreal estate and consumer credit card\nexposure, as well as our commercial real\nestate and asset managers and funds\nportfolios, which represent a\nsignificant percentage of our overall\ncredit portfolio. Declining home price\nvaluations and demand where we have\nlarge concentrations could result in\nincreased servicing advances and\nexpenses, defaults, delinquencies or\ncredit losses. The impacts of\nearthquakes, as well as climate change,\nsuch as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and the\nincreasing frequency and severity of\nextreme weather events and natural\ndisasters, including droughts, floods,\nwildfires and hurricanes, could\nnegatively impact collateral, the\nvaluations of home or commercial real\nestate or our clients\u2019 ability and/or\nwillingness to pay fees, outstanding\nloans or afford new products. This could\nalso cause insurability risk and/or\nincreased insurance costs to clients.\nEconomic weaknesses, particularly from\nincreases in inflation or sustained\nelevated inflation, adverse business\nconditions, market disruptions, adverse\neconomic or market events, rising\ninterest or capitalization rates,\ndeclining asset prices, greater\nvolatility in areas where we have\nconcentrated credit risk or\ndeterioration in real estate values or\nhousehold incomes may cause us to\nexperience higher credit losses in our\nportfolios or write down the value of\ncertain assets. We could also experience\ncontinued and long-term negative impacts\nto our commercial credit exposure and an\nincrease in credit losses within those\nindustries that may be permanently\nimpacted by a change in consumer\npreferences or other industry\ndisruptions.\n\nWe also enter into transactions with\nsovereign nations, U.S. states and\nmunicipalities. Uncertain economic or\npolitical conditions or policies, such\nas economic sanctions or increased\ntariffs, disruptions to capital markets,\ncurrency fluctuations, changes in\ncommodity prices and social instability,\ncould adversely impact the operating\nbudgets or credit ratings of government\nentities and expose us to credit and\nliquidity risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may result in our inability to\nsell, syndicate or realize the value of\nour positions, increasing\nconcentrations, which could increase RWA\nand the credit and market risk\nassociated with our positions, and\nincrease operational and litigation\ncosts.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by\nweaknesses in the U.S. housing market.\n\nDuring 2024, the U.S. housing market\ncontinued to be impacted by higher\nmortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-\nrate mortgages that more than doubled\nfrom 2021, and higher home prices (in\nvarying degrees among markets) that have\nnegatively impacted housing\naffordability and the demand for many of\nour products. Also, our mortgage loan\nproduction volume is generally\ninfluenced by the rate of growth in\nresidential\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America12                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmortgage debt outstanding and the size\nof the residential mortgage market, both\nof which have slowed due to higher\ninterest rates and reduced\naffordability. A deeper downturn in the\ncondition of the U.S. housing market\ncould result in significant write-downs\nof asset values in several asset\nclasses, notably mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS). If the U.S. housing\nmarket were to further weaken, the value\nof real estate could decline, which\ncould result in increased credit losses\nand delinquent servicing expenses,\nnegatively affect our representations\nand warranties exposures, and adversely\naffect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nOur derivatives businesses may expose us\nto unexpected risks, which may result in\nlosses and adversely affect liquidity.\n\nWe are party to a large number of\nderivatives transactions that may expose\nus to unexpected market, credit and\noperational risks that could cause us to\nsuffer unexpected losses. Fluctuations\nin asset values or rates or an\nunanticipated credit event, including\nunforeseen circumstances that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to\nbecome correlated, may lead to losses\nresulting from risks not taken into\naccount or anticipated in the\ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a\nderivative instrument. Certain\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements provide that upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events,\nsuch as a change to our or our\naffiliates\u2019 credit ratings, we may be\nrequired to provide additional\ncollateral or take other remedial\nactions, and we could experience\nincreased difficulty obtaining funding\nor hedging risks. In some cases our\ncounterparties may have the right to\nterminate or otherwise diminish our\nrights under these contracts or\nagreements upon the occurrence of such\nevents.\n\nWe are also a member of various CCPs,\nwhich results in credit risk exposure to\nthose CCPs. In the event that one or\nmore members of a CCP defaults on their\nobligations, we may be required to pay a\nportion of any losses incurred by such\nCCP. A CCP may also, at its discretion,\nmodify the margin we are required to\npost, which could mean unexpected and\nincreased funding costs and exposure to\nthat CCP. As a clearing member, we are\nexposed to the risk of non-performance\nby our clients for which we clear\ntransactions, which may not be covered\nby available collateral. Also, default\nby a significant market participant may\nresult in further risk and potential\nlosses.\n                                                                                  \n  Geopolitical                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to numerous political,\neconomic, market, reputational,\noperational, compliance, legal,\nregulatory and other risks in the\njurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe do business throughout the world,\nincluding in emerging markets. Economic\nor geopolitical stress in one or more\ncountries could have a negative impact\nregionally or globally, resulting in,\namong other things, market volatility,\nreduced market value and economic\noutput. Our liquidity and credit risk\ncould be adversely impacted by, and our\nbusinesses and revenues derived from\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to,\nrisk of loss from financial, social or\njudicial instability, economic\nsanctions, changes in government\nleadership, including from electoral\noutcomes or otherwise, changes in\ngovernmental or central bank policies,\nexpropriation, nationalization and/or\nconfiscation of assets, price controls,\nhigh inflation, natural disasters, the\nemergence of widespread health\nemergencies or pandemics, capital\ncontrols, currency re-denomination risk\nfrom a country exiting the EU or\notherwise, currency fluctuations,\nforeign exchange controls or movements\n(caused by devaluation or de-pegging),\nunfavorable political and diplomatic\ndevelopments, oil price fluctuations and\nchanges in legislation. These risks are\nespecially elevated in emerging markets.\n\nPolitical and economic interactions\nbetween the U.S. and important trading\npartners, including China, but also more\nbroadly across the EU, Latin America and\nCanada, may result in sanctions, further\ntariff increases or other restrictive\nactions on cross-border trade,\ninvestment and transfer of data and\ninformation technology. Such actions,\nwhich may also include actions taken\nagainst other countries to enforce trade\nrestrictions, could reduce trade\nvolumes, result in further supply chain\ndisruptions, increase costs for\nproducers, and adversely affect our\nbusinesses and revenues, as well as our\nclients and counterparties, including\ntheir credit quality.\n\nSlowing growth, recessionary conditions,\nadverse geopolitical conditions and\npolitical or civil unrest, foreign trade\ncompetition, labor shortages, wage\npressures and elevated inflation in\ncertain countries pose challenges,\nincluding from volatility in financial\nmarkets. Foreign exchange rates against\nthe U.S. dollar remain uncertain and\npotentially volatile, and depreciation\ncould increase our financial risks with\nclients that deal in non-U.S. currencies\nbut have U.S. dollar-denominated debt.\n\nWe invest or trade in the securities of\ncorporations and governments located in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions, including\nemerging markets. Revenues from the\ntrading of non-U.S. securities may be\nsubject to negative fluctuations as a\nresult of the above factors.\nFurthermore, the impact of these\nfluctuations could be magnified because\nnon-U.S. trading markets, particularly\nin emerging markets, are generally\nsmaller, less liquid and more volatile\nthan U.S. trading markets. Risks in one\nnation can limit our opportunities for\nportfolio growth and negatively affect\nour operations in other nations,\nincluding our U.S. operations. Market\nand economic disruptions may affect\nconsumer confidence levels and spending,\ncorporate investment and job creation,\nbankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence\nand default on consumer and corporate\ndebt, economic growth rates and asset\nvalues, among other factors.\n\nElevated government debt levels raise\nthe risk of volatility, significant\nvaluation changes and political tensions\nregarding fiscal policy or defaults on\nor devaluation of sovereign debt, all of\nwhich could expose us to substantial\nlosses. Financial markets have been and\nmay continue to be sensitive to\ngovernment budget processes and changes\nto fiscal policy, as well as any\nresulting political turmoil.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by governments,\nsecurities exchanges and regulators,\ncentral banks and other regulatory\nbodies. In many countries, the laws and\nregulations applicable to the financial\nservices and securities industries are\nless predictable, prone to change and\nuncertainty, and regularly evolving.\nSignificant resources are spent on\ndetermining, understanding and\nmonitoring foreign LRRs, some with less\npredictable legal and regulatory\nframeworks, as well as managing our\nrelationships with multiple regulators\nin various jurisdictions. Our inability\nto remain in compliance with local laws\nand manage our relationships with\nregulators could result in increased\nexpenses, changes to our organizational\nstructure and adversely affect our\nbusinesses, reputation and results of\noperations in that market.\n\nWe are also subject to complex and\nextensive U.S. and non-U.S. LRRs, which\nsubject us to costs and risks relating\nto bribery and corruption, know-your-\ncustomer requirements, anti-money\nlaundering, embargo programs and\neconomic sanctions, which can vary by\njurisdiction and require implementation\nof complex operational capabilities and\ncompliance programs. Non-compliance,\nincluding improper implementation,\nand/or violations could result in an\nincrease in operational and compliance\ncosts, and enforcement actions and civil\nand criminal penalties against us and\nindividual employees. The\n                                                                                  \n  13Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nincreasing speed and novel ways in which\nfunds circulate could make it more\nchallenging to track the movement of\nfunds and heighten financial crimes\nrisk. Compliance with these evolving\nregulatory regimes and legal\nrequirements depends on our ability to\nimprove and/or evolve our processes,\ncontrols, surveillance, detection and\nreporting and analytic capabilities and\ncould be adversely impacted by\noperational failures.\n\nIn the U.S., the political uncertainty\naround the federal government\u2019s debt\nceiling, a growing federal budget\ndeficit and government debt levels could\ncreate the possibility of U.S.\ngovernment defaults on its debt and/or\nfurther downgrades to its credit\nratings, and prolonged government\nshutdowns, which could weaken the U.S.\ndollar, cause market volatility,\nnegatively impact the global economy and\nbanking system and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition, including our\nliquidity. Also, changes in fiscal,\nmonetary, regulatory, trade and/or\nforeign policy, labor shortages, wage\npressures, supply chain disruptions and\nhigher inflation, could increase our\ncompliance costs and adversely affect\nour business operations, organizational\nstructure and results of operations.\nEmerging market currency values and\nmonetary policy settings are\nparticularly sensitive to such changes\nin U.S. monetary policy. Also, elevated\nor rising U.S. interest rate levels or\nhigh tariff rates, could result in\nadditional currency volatility and\nrecessionary conditions in a number of\nnon-U.S. markets.\n\nWe are also subject to geopolitical\nrisks, including economic sanctions,\nacts or threats of international or\ndomestic terrorism, including responses\nby the U.S. or other governments\nthereto, corporate espionage, increased\nstate-sponsored cyberattacks or\ncampaigns, civil unrest and/or military\nconflicts, including the escalation of\ntensions between China and Taiwan, which\ncould adversely affect business, market\ntrade and general economic conditions\nabroad and in the U.S. The\nRussia/Ukraine conflict and the\nconflicts in the Middle East have\nmagnified such risks and resulted in\nregional instability, and adverse\ndevelopments in or expansion of these\nconflicts could negatively impact\ncommodity and other financial markets,\nas well as economic conditions. Widening\nregional conflicts resulting in the\ninvolvement of neighboring countries\nand/or North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization member countries and/or\nmilitary conflicts in other areas of the\nworld could result in additional\neconomic disruptions, financial market\nvolatility, higher inflation and changes\nto asset valuations, which could disrupt\nour operations and adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Business Operations                                                             \n                                                                                  \nA failure in or breach of our operations\nor information systems, or those of\nthird parties or the financial services\nindustry, could cause disruptions,\nadversely impact our businesses, results\nof operations and financial condition,\nand cause legal or reputational harm.\n\nOperational risk exposure exists\nthroughout our organization, including\nrisks arising from our operations and\ninformation systems, which comprise the\nhardware, software, infrastructure,\nbackup systems and other technology that\nwe own or use to collect, process,\nmaintain, use, share, transmit or\ndispose of information, including\npersonal and/or confidential employee,\nclient and third-party information,\nwhich are integral to the performance of\nour businesses. Our extensive\ninteractions with, and reliance on,\nthird parties and the financial services\nindustry, including the processing and\nreporting of a large number of complex\ntransactions at increasing speeds in\nmany currencies and jurisdictions create\nadditional operational risk to us.\n\nOur operations and information systems\nand components thereof, and those of our\nthird parties, have been, and in the\n\nfuture will likely be, ineffective or\nfail to operate properly or become\ndisabled or damaged as a result of a\nnumber of factors, including events that\nmay be wholly or partially beyond our or\nsuch third party\u2019s control. Such events\nhave adversely affected, and in the\nfuture could adversely affect, physical\nsite access of our operations, the\nsafeguarding of information and our\nability to process transactions, provide\nservices to our clients and perform\nother operations, including reporting\nand decision-making. Short-term or\nprolonged disruptions to our or our\nthird parties\u2019 critical business\noperations and client services are\npossible, such as due to computer,\ntelecommunications, network, utility,\nelectronic or physical infrastructure\noutages, including from abuse or failure\nof our electronic trading and\nalgorithmic platforms, significant\nunplanned increases in client\ntransactions, fraudulent transactions,\ncyberattacks, aging information systems,\nnewly introduced or identified\nvulnerabilities or defects in key\nhardware and software, failure of or\ndefects in infrastructure or manual\nprocesses, technology project\nimplementation challenges and supply\nchain disruptions. Operational\ndisruptions and prolonged operational\noutages could also result from events\narising from natural disasters,\nincluding acute and chronic weather\nevents, such as wildfires, tornadoes,\nhurricanes and floods, some of which are\nhappening with more frequency and\nseverity, and earthquakes, as well as\nlocal or larger scale political or\nsocial matters, including civil unrest,\nterrorist acts and military conflict.\n\nWe continue to have greater reliance on\nour and our third parties\u2019 remote access\ntools and technology, and employees\u2019\npersonal systems and increased data\nutilization and dependence upon our\ninformation systems to operate our\nbusinesses, including from evolving\nclient preferences, which has led to\nincreased reliance on digital banking\nand other digital services provided by\nour businesses. Effective management of\nour business continuity increasingly\ndepends on the security, reliability and\nadequacy of such systems.\n\nWe also rely on our employees,\nrepresentatives and third parties in our\nday-to-day operations, who may, due to\nillness, unavailability, the emergence\nof widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, human error, misconduct\n(including errors in judgment, malice,\nfraud or illegal activity), malfeasance\nor a failure, breach or misuse of\ninformation systems, cause disruptions\nto our organization and expose us to\noperational losses, regulatory risk and\nreputational harm. Our and our third\nparties\u2019 inability to properly\nintroduce, deploy and manage operational\nor technology changes and continuously\nalter, improve and automate processes\nand systems, including related controls,\nsuch as regarding internal financial and\ngovernance processes, existing products\nand services, and new product\ninnovations and technology, could also\nresult in additional operational,\ninformation security, reputational and\nregulatory risk, including from the use\nof artificial intelligence (AI), such as\nmachine learning and generative AI.\n\nRegardless of the measures we have taken\nto implement training, procedures,\ncontrols, backup systems and other\nsafeguards to support our operations and\nbolster our operational resilience, our\nability to conduct business may be\nadversely affected by significant\nfailures or disruptions to us or to\nthird parties with whom we interact or\nupon whom we rely, including localized\nor systemic cyber events or other\ntechnology incidents that result in\noutages or unavailability of information\nsystems, part or all of the internet,\ncloud services and/or the financial\nservices industry infrastructure\n(including funds transfers, electronic\ntrading and algorithmic platforms and\ncritical banking activities), which\ncould be exacerbated by the\nconcentration of third-party service\nproviders or third-party\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America14                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmodels, including AI, and result in\nsystemic operational impact across the\nfinancial services industry or beyond.\nOur ability to implement backup systems\nand other safeguards with respect to\nthird-party systems and the financial\nservices industry infrastructure is more\nlimited than with respect to our\nsystems. Weakness in and/or the\ninability to simplify and improve our\nand our third parties\u2019 processes or\ncontrols could impact our ability to\ndeliver products or services to our\nclients and expose us to regulatory,\nreputational and operational risks.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our\nresiliency, business continuity,\ntechnology change and information\nsecurity response plans will effectively\nmitigate our operational risks. Any\nbackup systems or manual processes may\nnot process data accurately and/or as\nquickly or effectively as our primary\nsystems, and some data might not be\navailable or backed up. Also, the speed\nin which we are able to remediate any\nfailure or disruption of our operations\nand/or information systems may vary\nacross jurisdictions. We regularly\nupdate the operational processes and\ninformation systems we rely on to\nsupport our operations and growth,\nincluding as part of our efforts to\ncomply with all applicable LRRs\nglobally. This updating entails\nsignificant costs and creates risks\nassociated with implementing new or\nmodified operational processes and\ninformation systems and integrating them\nwith existing information systems,\nincluding business interruptions,\nfailures or ineffectiveness.\n\nIncreasing reliance on our information\nsystems and frequency of natural\ndisasters heighten our risk of\noperational loss. Any failure or\ndisruption of our or our third parties\u2019\noperations or information systems\nresulting in disruption to our critical\nbusiness operations and client services,\na failure to identify or effectively\nrespond to operational risks timely\nand/or a failure to continue to deliver\nour services through an operational\nfailure or disruption could impact the\nconfidentiality, integrity or\navailability of data and information,\nand expose us to various risks,\nincluding market abuse, fraud, financial\nlosses and other costs, misappropriation\nand corruption, loss of trust or\nconfidence in us and/or the financial\nservices industry, client attrition,\nregulatory (e.g., LRR compliance),\nmarket, privacy and liquidity risk,\nadversely impact our results of\noperations and financial condition and\ncause legal, regulatory or reputational\nharm.\n\nThe Corporation and third parties with\nwhom we interact and/or on whom we rely,\nare subject to cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches, and\ntechnology failures that have and in the\nfuture could adversely affect our\nability to conduct our businesses,\nresult in the alteration,\nunavailability, misuse, destruction or\ndisclosure of information, damage our\nreputation, increase our regulatory and\nlegal risks, result in additional costs\nor financial losses and/or otherwise\nadversely impact our businesses and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the\nsecurity, controls and efficacy of our\ninformation systems, and the information\nsystems of our clients, third parties,\nthe financial services industry and\nfinancial data aggregators with whom we\ninteract, on whom we rely or who have\naccess to our clients\u2019 personal or\naccount information. We rely on\neffective access management and the\nsecure collection, processing,\nmaintenance, use, transmission, storage,\ndissemination and disposition of\ninformation in our and our third\nparties\u2019 information systems. Our\ncybersecurity risk and exposure remains\nheightened because of, among other\nthings, our prominent size and scale,\nhigh-profile brand, geographic footprint\nand international presence and role in\nthe financial services industry and the\nbroader economy. The proliferation of\nthird-party financial data aggregators\nand emerging technologies, including AI\n(such as\n\nmachine learning and generative AI) and\nrobotics, increases our cybersecurity\nrisks and exposure, including by making\nfraud detection and authentication more\ndifficult.\n\nWe, our employees, customers, regulators\nand third parties are ongoing targets of\nan increasing number of cybersecurity\nthreats and cyberattacks. The tactics,\ntechniques and procedures used in\ncyberattacks are pervasive,\nsophisticated, evolving and designed to\nevade security measures, including\ncomputer viruses, malicious or\ndestructive code (such as ransomware),\nsocial engineering (including phishing,\nvishing and smishing), real and virtual\nimpersonation, denial of service or\ninformation or other security breach\ntactics that have and in the future are\nlikely to result in disruptions to our\nbusinesses and operations and the loss\nof funds, including from attempts to\ndefraud us and/or our customers, and\nimpact the confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of our information,\nincluding intellectual property, or the\npersonal and/or confidential information\nof our employees, clients and third\nparties. Cyberattacks are carried out on\na worldwide scale and by a growing\nnumber of actors, including organized\ncrime groups, hackers, terrorist\norganizations, extremist parties,\nhostile foreign governments and their\nproxies, state-sponsored actors,\nactivists, disgruntled employees and\nother persons or entities, including for\ncorporate espionage.\n\nCybersecurity threats and the tactics,\ntechniques and procedures used in\ncyberattacks change, develop and evolve\nrapidly and continuously, including from\ngrowth in third-party services that\nfacilitate or carry out cyberattacks and\nfrom emerging technologies, such as AI\n(including machine learning and\ngenerative AI) and quantum computing,\nwhich may be used to enhance the\ntactics, techniques and procedures\ndescribed above and facilitate new cyber\nthreats. Despite substantial efforts to\nprotect the integrity and resilience of\nour information systems and implement\ncontrols, processes, policies, employee\ntraining and other protective measures,\nwe cannot anticipate and detect all\ncybersecurity threats and incidents\nand/or develop or implement effective\npreventive or defensive measures\ndesigned to prevent, respond to or\nmitigate all cybersecurity threats and\nincidents. Internal access management or\nother technology failures could impact\nthe confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of data and information.\nOur vulnerability increases if employees\nfail to exercise sound judgment and\nvigilance when targeted with social\nengineering or other cyberattacks\nincreases our vulnerability.\n\nOur risk from and exposure to\ncybersecurity threats and incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures continues to\nincrease due to the acceptance and use\nof digital banking and other digital\nproducts and services, including mobile\nbanking products, and reliance on remote\naccess tools and other technology, which\nhave increased our reliance on virtual\nor digital interactions and a growing\nnumber of access points to our\ninformation systems that must be\nsecured, and results in greater amounts\nof information being available for\naccess. Greater demand on our\ninformation systems and security tools\nand processes will likely continue.\n\nWe also face significant third-party\ntechnology, cybersecurity and\noperational risks relating to the large\nnumber of clients and third parties with\nwhom we do business, the financial\nservices industry, upon whom we rely to\nfacilitate or enable our business\nactivities or upon whom our clients\nrely, including the secure collection,\nprocessing, maintenance, use, sharing,\ndissemination and disposition of client\nand other sensitive information,\nproviders of products and services,\nfinancial counterparties, financial data\naggregators, financial intermediaries,\nsuch as clearing agents, exchanges and\nclearing\n                                                                                  \n  15Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nhouses, regulators, federal and state\ngovernments, providers of outsourced\nsoftware, services and infrastructure,\nsuch as internet access, cloud service\nproviders and electrical power, and\nretailers for whom we process\ntransactions. Such third-party\ninformation systems extend beyond our\nsecurity and control systems, and such\nthird parties have varying levels of\nsecurity and cybersecurity resources,\nexpertise, safeguards, controls and\ncapabilities. Threat actors may actively\nseek to exploit third-party security and\ncybersecurity weaknesses, and the\nrelationships of our third parties with\nus may increase the risk that they are\ntargeted by the same threats we face,\nand such third parties may be less\nprepared for such threats. Also, we are\nat risk from critical third-party\ninformation security and open-source or\nproprietary software defects and\nvulnerabilities. We must rely on our\nthird parties to adequately detect and\npromptly report cybersecurity incidents.\nTheir failure could adversely affect our\nability to report or respond to\ncybersecurity incidents effectively or\ntimely.\n\nDue to increasing consolidation,\ninterdependence and complexity of\nfinancial entities and technology and\ninformation systems, a cybersecurity\nthreat or incident, information or\nsecurity breach or technology failure\nthat significantly exposes, degrades,\ndestroys, renders unavailable or\ncompromises the information systems or\ninformation of one or more financial\nentities or third parties could\nadversely impact us and increase the\nrisk of operational failure and loss, as\ndisparate information systems need to be\nintegrated, often on an accelerated\nbasis. Similarly, any cybersecurity\nthreat or incident, information or\nsecurity breach or technology failure\nthat significantly exposes, degrades,\ndestroys, renders unavailable or\ncompromises our information systems or\ninformation could adversely impact third\nparties and the critical infrastructure\nof the financial services industry,\nthereby creating additional risk for us.\n\nCybersecurity incidents or information\nor security breaches could persist for\nan extended period of time prior to\ndetection, and it often takes additional\ntime to determine the scope, extent,\namount and type of impact, including the\ninformation altered, destroyed, accessed\nor otherwise compromised, following\nwhich the measures to recover and\nrestore to a business-as-usual state may\nbe difficult to assess and require\nnotification to our clients, government\nofficials and regulators. We have spent\nand expect to continue to spend\nsignificant resources to modify and\nenhance our protective measures and our\ncapabilities to respond and recover,\ninvestigate and remediate software and\nnetwork defects and vulnerabilities, and\ndefend against, detect and respond to\ncybersecurity threats and incidents,\nwhether to us, third parties, the\nindustry or businesses generally.\n\nWhile we and our third parties have\nexperienced cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures, as well as adverse\nimpacts from such events, including as\ndescribed in this risk factor, we have\nnot experienced material losses or other\nmaterial consequences relating to\ncybersecurity incidents, information or\nsecurity breaches or technology\nfailures, whether directed at us or our\nthird parties. However, we expect to\ncontinue to experience such events and\nimpacts ourself and at our third parties\nwith increased frequency and severity\ndue to the evolving threat environment,\nand there can be no assurance that\nfuture cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures, including as a\nresult of cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures experienced by our\nthird parties, will not have a material\nadverse impact on us, including our\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nFuture cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation or security breaches or\ntechnology failures suffered by us or\nour third parties could result in\ndisruption to our day-to-day business\nactivities and an inability to effect\ntransactions, execute trades, service\nour clients, safeguard information,\nmanage our exposure to risk, expand our\nbusinesses, detect and prevent\nfraudulent or unauthorized transactions,\nincluding transactions impacting our\nclients, maintain information systems\naccess and business operations and\nclient services, in the U.S. and/or\nglobally. Also, we could experience the\nloss of clients and business\nopportunities, the withdrawal of client\ndeposits, the misappropriation,\nalteration or destruction of our or our\nthird parties\u2019 intellectual property or\nconfidential information, the\nunauthorized access to or temporary or\npermanent loss or theft of information,\nincluding of our employees and clients,\nsignificant lost revenue, increased risk\nof fraudulent transactions, losses and\nclaims brought by third parties,\nviolations of applicable privacy,\ncybersecurity and other LRRs, litigation\nexposure, economic sanctions,\nenforcement actions, government fines,\npenalties or intervention and other\nnegative consequences. Although we\nmaintain cyber insurance, there can be\nno assurance that liabilities or losses\nwe may incur will be covered under such\npolicies or that the amount of insurance\nwill be adequate. In the case of any\ncybersecurity incident, information or\nsecurity breach or technology failure\narising from third-party systems\nimpacting us, any third-party\nindemnification may not be applicable or\nsufficient to address the impact of such\ncybersecurity incidents, information or\nsecurity breaches or technology\nfailures, including monetary losses of\nthe Corporation. The occurrence of any\nof the events described above could\nadversely impact our businesses, results\nof operations, liquidity and financial\ncondition, and cause reputational harm,\nwhether such events are actual or\nperceived.\n\nFailure to satisfy our obligations as\nservicer for residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, loans owned by other\nentities and other related losses could\nadversely impact our reputation,\nservicing costs or results of\noperations.\n\nWe service mortgage loans on behalf of\nthird-party securitization vehicles and\nother investors. If a material breach of\nour obligations as servicer or master\nservicer is committed, we may be subject\nto termination if the breach is not\ncured timely following notice, which\ncould cause us to lose servicing income.\nWe may also have liability for any\nfailure by us or a third party, as a\nservicer or master servicer to adhere to\nor perform the required servicing\nobligation in accordance with the terms\nof the servicing agreements that result\nin impairment or loss to the loans\u2019\nowner. If any such breach was found to\nhave occurred, it may harm our\nreputation, increase our servicing costs\nor losses due to potential\nindemnification obligations, result in\nlitigation or regulatory action or\nadversely impact our results of\noperations. Also, foreclosures may\nresult in costs, litigation or losses\ndue to irregularities in the underlying\ndocumentation, or if the validity of a\nforeclosure action is challenged by a\nborrower or overturned by a court\nbecause of errors or deficiencies in the\nforeclosure process. We may also incur\ncosts or losses relating to delays or\nalleged deficiencies in processing\ndocuments necessary to comply with state\nlaw governing foreclosure.\n\nChanges in the structure of and\nrelationship among the GSEs could\nadversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or\npurchase certain mortgage loans that\nmeet their conforming loan requirements.\nDuring 2024, we sold approximately $1.5\nbillion of loans to GSEs, primarily\nFreddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie\nMae are currently in conservatorship,\nwith the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nacting as conservator. While there have\nbeen\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \nperiodic proposals to remove or exit the\nGSEs from conservatorship and eliminate\nthe perceived \u201cimplicit guarantee\u201d\nassociated with the GSEs, none have been\nsuccessful. We cannot predict the future\nprospects of the GSEs, including the\ntiming of any recapitalization or\nrelease from conservatorship, or any\nlegislative or rulemaking proposals\nregarding the GSEs\u2019 status in the\nhousing market. If the GSEs take a\nreduced role in the marketplace,\nincluding by limiting the mortgage\nproducts they offer, we could be\nrequired to seek alternative funding\nsources, retain additional loans on our\nbalance sheet, secure funding through\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank system, or\nsecuritize the loans through Private\nLabel Securitization, which could\nincrease our cost of funds related to\nthe origination of new mortgage loans,\nincrease credit risk and/or impact our\ncapacity to originate new mortgage\nloans. These developments could\nadversely affect our securities\nportfolios, capital levels, liquidity\nand results of operations.\n\nOur risk management framework may not be\neffective in mitigating risk and\nreducing the potential for losses.\n\nOur risk management framework is\ndesigned to minimize our risk and loss.\nWe seek to effectively and consistently\nidentify, measure, monitor, report and\ncontrol the risk types to which we are\nsubject, including the seven key risk\ntypes we face. Risks also may span\nacross multiple key risk types,\nincluding cybersecurity risk, climate\nrisk, legal risk and concentration risk.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified\nset of controls and risk mitigation\ntechniques, including modeling and\nforecasting, hedging strategies and\ntechniques seeking to balance our\nability to profit from trading positions\nwith our exposure to potential losses,\nwe are inherently limited by our ability\nto identify and measure all risks,\nincluding emerging and unknown risks,\nanticipate the timing and impact of\nrisks, apply effective hedging\nstrategies, make correct assumptions,\nmanage and aggregate data correctly and\nefficiently, identify changes in markets\nor client behaviors not historically\nreflected and develop risk management\nmodels and forecasts to assess and\ncontrol risk.\n\nOur risk management depends on our\nability to consistently execute all\nelements of our risk management program,\ndevelop and maintain a culture of\nmanaging risk well throughout the\nCorporation and manage third-party\nrisks, including providers of products\nand services, to allow for effective\nrisk management and help confirm that\nrisks are appropriately considered,\nevaluated and responded to timely.\nUncertain economic and geopolitical\nconditions, widespread health\nemergencies and pandemics, heightened\nlegislative and regulatory scrutiny of\nand change within the financial services\nindustry, the pace of technological\nchanges, including AI (such as machine\nlearning and generative AI) and quantum\ncomputing, accounting, tax and market\ndevelopments, the failure of employees,\nrepresentatives and third parties to\ncomply with our policies and Risk\nFramework and the overall complexity of\nour operations, among other\ndevelopments, have in the past and may\nin the future, result in a heightened\nlevel of risk, including operational,\nreputational and compliance risk.\nFailure to manage evolving risks or\nproperly anticipate, escalate, manage,\ncontrol or mitigate risks could result\nin additional legal, regulatory and\nreputational risk, losses and adversely\naffect our results of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe are highly regulated and subject to\nevolving government legislation and\nregulations and certain settlements,\norders and agreements with government\nauthorities from time to time.\n\nWe are highly regulated and subject to\nevolving and comprehensive regulation\nunder federal and state laws in the U.S.\nand the laws of the various foreign\njurisdictions in which we\n\noperate. These laws and regulations\nsignificantly affect and have the\npotential to increase our compliance\ncosts, restrict the scope of our\nexisting businesses, require changes to\nour employment practices, business\nstrategies and controls and procedures,\nlimit our ability to pursue certain\nbusiness opportunities, including the\nproducts and services we offer, reduce\ncertain fees and rates and/or make our\nproducts and services more expensive for\nour clients. We are also required to\nfile various financial and nonfinancial\nregulatory reports to comply with LRRs\nin the jurisdictions in which we\noperate, which results in additional\ncompliance and operational risk.\n\nWe continue to adjust our business and\noperations, legal entity structure,\nsystems, disclosure, policies,\nprocedures, processes, controls and\ngovernance, including with regard to\ncapital and liquidity management, risk\nmanagement and data management, in an\neffort to comply with LRRs, and evolving\nexpectations, guidance and\ninterpretation by regulatory\nauthorities, including the Department of\nTreasury (including the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and OFAC), Financial\nCrimes Enforcement Network, Federal\nReserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability\nOversight Council, FDIC, Department of\nLabor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S., foreign\nregulators, other government authorities\nand self-regulatory organizations.\nFurther, we expect to become subject to\nfuture LRRs, including beyond those\ncurrently proposed, adopted or\ncontemplated in the U.S. or abroad, and\nevolving interpretations of existing and\nfuture LRRs, which may include policies\nand rulemaking related to FDIC\nassessments, loss allocations between\nfinancial institutions and clients\nregarding the use of our products and\nservices, including electronic payments,\nemerging technologies, such as the\ndevelopment and use of AI (including\nmachine learning and generative AI),\ncybersecurity and data, employment\npractices and further climate and\nenvironmental risk management and\nsustainability reporting and disclosure,\nincluding emissions.\n\nThe cumulative effect of all of the\ncurrent and possible future legislation\nand regulations, as well as related\ninterpretations, on our litigation and\nregulatory exposure, businesses,\noperations, including our ability to\ncompete, and profitability remains\nuncertain and necessitates that we make\ncertain assumptions with respect to the\nscope and requirements of existing,\nprospective and proposed LRRs in our\nbusiness planning and strategies. If\nthese assumptions prove incorrect, we\ncould be subject to increased\nregulatory, legal and compliance risks\nand costs, and potential reputational\nharm. Also, regulatory initiatives in\nthe U.S. and abroad may overlap, and\nnon-U.S. regulations and initiatives may\nbe inconsistent or conflict with current\nor proposed U.S. regulations or with\neach other, which could lead to\ncompliance risks and higher costs.\n\nOur regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad\npower and discretion to direct our\nactions, and they have assumed an active\noversight, inspection and investigatory\nrole across the financial services\nindustry. Regulatory focus is not\nlimited to LRRs applicable to the\nfinancial services industry, but\nincludes other significant LRRs that\napply across industries and\njurisdictions, including those related\nto anti-money laundering, anti-bribery,\nanti-corruption know-your-customer\nrequirements, embargo programs and\neconomic sanctions.\n\nWe are also subject to LRRs in the U.S.\nand abroad, including the GDPR and CCPA,\nand a number of additional jurisdictions\nenacting or considering similar laws or\namendments to existing laws, regarding\nprivacy and the disclosure, collection,\nuse, sharing and safeguarding of\npersonally identifiable information,\nincluding our employees, clients,\nsuppliers, counterparties and other\nthird parties, the violation of which\ncould result in litigation, regulatory\nfines,\n                                                                                  \n  17Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nenforcement actions and operational\nloss. Also, we are and will continue to\nbe subject to new and evolving data\nprivacy laws in the U.S. and abroad,\nwhich could result in additional costs\nof compliance, litigation, regulatory\nfines and enforcement actions. There\nremains complexity and uncertainty,\nincluding potential suspension or\nprohibition, regarding data transfer\nbecause of concerns over compliance with\nLRRs for cross-border flows and\ntransfers of personal data from the\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S.\nand other jurisdictions outside of the\nEEA, resulting from judicial and\nregulatory guidance. Other\njurisdictions, including China and\nIndia, have commenced consultation\nefforts or enacted new legislation or\nregulations to establish standards for\npersonal data transfers. If cross-border\npersonal data transfers are suspended or\nrestricted or we are required to\nimplement distinct processes for each\njurisdiction\u2019s standards, this could\nresult in operational disruptions to our\nbusinesses, additional costs, increased\nenforcement activity, new contract\nnegotiations with third parties, and/or\nmodification of such data management.\n\nAs part of their enforcement authority,\nour regulators and other government\nauthorities have the authority to, among\nother things, conduct investigations and\nassess significant civil or criminal\nmonetary fines, penalties or\nrestitution, issue cease and desist\norders, suspend or withdraw licenses and\nauthorizations, initiate injunctive\naction, apply regulatory sanctions or\ncause us to enter into consent orders.\nThe amounts paid by us and other\nfinancial institutions to settle\nproceedings or investigations have, in\nsome instances, been substantial and may\nincrease. In some cases, governmental\nauthorities have required criminal pleas\nor other extraordinary terms as part of\nsuch resolutions, which could have\nsignificant consequences, including\nreputational harm, loss of clients,\nrestrictions on the ability to access\ncapital markets, and the inability to\noperate certain businesses or offer\ncertain products. Our responses to\nregulators and other government\nauthorities have been and may continue\nto be time-consuming and expensive and\ndivert management attention from our\nbusiness. The outcome of any matter,\nwhich may last years, may be difficult\nto predict or estimate.\n\nThe terms of settlements, orders and\nagreements that we have entered into\nwith government entities and regulatory\nauthorities have also imposed, or could\nimpose, significant operational and\ncompliance costs on us with respect to\nenhancements to our procedures and\ncontrols, losses with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated\nagainst our clients, expansion of our\nrisk and control functions within our\nlines of business, investment in\ntechnology and the hiring of significant\nnumbers of additional risk, control and\ncompliance personnel. For example, in\nDecember 2024, the OCC issued a Consent\nOrder against BANA relating to certain\naspects of BANA\u2019s BSA, anti-money\nlaundering and economic sanctions\ncompliance programs, and we continue to\nrespond to requests for information\nabout similar aspects of such programs\nfrom other regulators. If we fail to\nmeet the requirements of the regulatory\nsettlements, orders or agreements to\nwhich we are subject, or, more\ngenerally, fail to maintain risk and\ncontrol procedures and processes that\nmeet the heightened standards\nestablished by our regulators and other\ngovernment authorities, we could be\nrequired to enter into further\nsettlements, orders or agreements and\npay additional fines, penalties or\njudgments, or accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on our businesses.\n\nImproper actions, behaviors or practices\nby us, our employees or representatives\nthat are illegal, unethical or contrary\nto our core values, including the\nhandling of fiduciary obligations,\nconflicts of interest and the misuse of\nconfidential\n\ninformation, could harm us, our\nshareholders or clients or damage the\nintegrity of the financial markets, and\nare subject to increasing regulatory\nscrutiny across jurisdictions. The\ncomplexity of the regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled\nwith the global scope of our operations\nand the regulatory environment\nworldwide, also means that a single\nevent or practice or a series of related\nevents or practices may give rise to a\nsignificant number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by multiple federal\nand state agencies in the U.S. or by\nmultiple regulators and other\ngovernmental entities in different\njurisdictions. Actions by other members\nof the financial services industry\nrelated to business activities in which\nwe participate may result in\ninvestigations by regulators or other\ngovernment authorities.\n\nWhile we believe that we have an\nappropriate approach to developing and\nimplementing risk management and\ncompliance programs, compliance risks\nwill continue to exist, particularly as\nwe anticipate and adapt to new and\nevolving LRRs and evolving\ninterpretations, and potential\nmisconduct by bad actors globally. We\nalso rely upon third parties who may\nexpose us to compliance and legal risk.\nFuture legislative or regulatory\nactions, and any required changes to our\nbusiness or operations or strategy, or\nthose of third parties upon whom we\nrely, resulting from such developments\nand actions could result in a\nsignificant loss of revenue, impose\nadditional compliance and other costs or\notherwise reduce our profitability,\nlimit the products and services that we\noffer or our ability to pursue certain\nbusinesses and business opportunities,\nrequire us to dispose of certain\nbusinesses or assets, affect the value\nof assets held, require changes in\ntraining, testing, governance, controls\nand procedures and compensation\npractices, require us to increase prices\nand therefore reduce demand for our\nproducts, or otherwise adversely affect\nour businesses.\n\nWe are subject to significant financial\nand reputational risks from potential\nliability arising from lawsuits and\nregulatory and government action.\n\nWe face significant legal risks in our\nbusiness, with a high volume of claims\nagainst us and other financial\ninstitutions, including conduct related\nto various products, services and\nmarkets. The amount of damages,\npenalties and fines that private\nlitigants, including clients and other\ncounterparties, and regulators seek from\nus and other financial institutions\ncontinues to be significant and\nunpredictable.\n\nU.S. regulators and government agencies\nregularly pursue enforcement claims and\nlitigation against financial\ninstitutions, including us, for alleged\nviolations of law and client harm,\nincluding under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and\nEnforcement Act, the federal securities\nlaws, the False Claims Act, fair lending\nlaws and regulations (including the\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act and the\nFair Housing Act), the FCPA, the BSA,\nregulations issued by OFAC, Home\nMortgage Disclosure Act, antitrust laws,\nand consumer protection laws and\nregulations related to products and\nservices such as overdraft and sales\npractices, including prohibitions on\nunfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts\nand practices (UDAAP) under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Act and the Federal\nTrade Commission Act, and EFTA, as well\nas other enforcement action taken by\nprudential regulators with respect to\nsafety, soundness and appropriateness of\nour business practices. Such claims may\ncarry significant penalties, restitution\nand, in certain cases, treble damages,\nand the ultimate resolution of\nregulatory inquiries, investigations and\nother proceedings which we are subject\nto from time-to-time is difficult to\npredict.\n\nIn particular, we are the subject of\nlitigation regarding our processing of\nelectronic payments through the Zelle\nnetwork,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18                                                               \n                                                                                  \nour efforts to detect, prevent and\naddress fraud perpetrated against our\nclients and/or the handling of fraud-\nrelated disputes, which could result in\nfines, judgments and/or settlements, and\nadversely affect our businesses and\nstrategies due to the treatment of loss\nallocations between clients and us, all\nof which could also adversely impact\nother similar products and services.\nFurther, in addition to the consent\norder referenced above regarding\nBSA/anti-money laundering and economic\nsanctions compliance programs, we have\nentered into orders or settlements with\ncertain government agencies regarding\nthe rates paid on uninvested cash in\nbrokerage and investment advisory\naccounts that is swept into interest-\npaying bank deposits, credit card sales\nand marketing practices and\nrepresentment fee practices and our\nparticipation in implementing\nCOVID-19-related government relief\nmeasures and other federal and state\ngovernment assistance programs,\nincluding the processing of unemployment\nbenefits for California and certain\nother states. We are subject to, or\ncould become subject to, related\nlitigation or investigations by other\nregulators with respect to the conduct\nthat gave rise to these orders, or the\norders or investigations we become\nsubject to in the future, which may\nresult in judgments and/or settlements.\n\nWe and our regulators have an increased\nfocus on information security. This\nincludes cybersecurity incidents\nperpetrated against us, our clients,\nproviders of products and services,\ncounterparties and other third parties,\nthe collection, use and sharing of data,\nand safeguarding of personally\nidentifiable information and corporate\ndata, as well as the development,\nimplementation, use and management of\nemerging technologies, including AI,\nwhich have resulted in, and will likely\ncontinue to result in, related\nlitigation or government enforcement,\nincluding with regard to compliance with\nU.S. and global LRRs, and could subject\nus to fines, judgments and/or\nsettlements and involve reputational\nlosses. We expect to also face\nincreasing scrutiny regarding\nsustainability-related policies, goals,\ntargets and disclosure, which could\nresult in litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions and\nreputational harm. Misconduct, or the\nperception of misconduct, by our\nemployees and representatives, including\nconflicts of interest, unethical,\nfraudulent, improper or illegal conduct,\nthe failure to fulfill fiduciary\nobligations, unfair, deceptive, abusive\nor discriminatory business practices, or\nviolations of policies, procedures or\nLRRs, including conduct that affects\ncompliance with books and records\nrequirements, have resulted and could\nresult in further litigation and/or\ngovernment investigations and\nenforcement actions, and cause\nsignificant reputational harm.\n\nThe global environment of extensive\ninvestigations, regulation, regulatory\ncompliance burdens, litigation and\nregulatory enforcement, combined with\nuncertainty related to the continually\nevolving regulatory environment, have\naffected and are likely to continue to\naffect operational and compliance costs\nand risks, including the adaptation of\nbusiness strategies, the limitation or\ncessation of our ability or feasibility\nto continue providing certain products\nand services and our employment\npractices. Lawsuits and regulatory\nactions have resulted in and will likely\ncontinue to result in judgments, orders,\nsettlements, penalties and fines adverse\nto us, in amounts that may be\nsignificant or unpredictable, and in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of\nreserves established. Litigation and\ninvestigation costs, substantial legal\nliability or significant regulatory or\ngovernment action against us could\nadversely affect our businesses,\nfinancial condition, including\nliquidity, and results of operations,\nand/or cause significant reputational\nharm.\n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may\nrequire increased capital and liquidity\nlevels, which could adversely impact the\nCorporation.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. capital and\nliquidity regulations. These rules,\namong other things, establish minimum\nratios relating to capital for different\ncategories of assets and exposures to\nqualify as a well-capitalized\ninstitution. As a G-SIB, we are also\nrequired to hold additional capital\nbuffers, including a G-SIB surcharge, a\nSCB and a countercyclical buffer, which\nare reassessed at least annually. Also,\nwe are subject to regulatory liquidity\nrequirements, including the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio and the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio. If any of our subsidiary\ninsured depository institutions fail to\nmaintain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d status under\nthe applicable regulatory capital rules,\nthe Federal Reserve will require us to\nagree to bring the insured depository\ninstitution back to well-capitalized\nstatus, which may include restrictions\non our activities, such as our ability\nto pay dividends and/or repurchase our\ncommon stock. If we were to fail to\nenter into or comply with such an\nagreement, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose more severe restrictions on our\nactivities, including requiring us to\ncease and desist activities otherwise\npermitted.\n\nFrom time to time regulators may change\nregulatory capital requirements,\nincluding total loss-absorbing capacity\n(TLAC) and long-term debt requirements,\nchange how regulatory capital or RWA is\ncalculated, or increase liquidity\nrequirements. These components of our\ncapital and liquidity ratios could also\nbe impacted by economic disruptions or\nother events that may cause an increase\nin our balance sheet, RWA or leverage\nexposures, which could increase the\namounts of regulatory capital or\nliquidity we are required to hold.\n\nIn 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued\nnotices of proposed rulemaking to revise\nthe measurement of RWA and the G-SIB\nsurcharge calculation, both of which may\nbe re-proposed. Also, in 2023, U.S.\nbanking regulators issued proposed\nchanges to the long-term debt\nrequirements for TLAC, which may impact\neligibility of certain debt instruments,\nand in 2024, the Federal Reserve\nseparately confirmed it is considering\nchanges to existing, as well as new,\nliquidity requirements. The timing and\ncomposition of any such proposals or re-\nproposals remain uncertain due to\nvarious factors, including changes of\nleadership positions in the U.S. bank\nregulatory agencies.\n\nOur ability to pay dividends or\nrepurchase common stock depends, in\npart, on our ability to maintain\nregulatory capital levels above minimum\nrequirements plus buffers. If increases\noccur in our SCB, G-SIB surcharge or\ncountercyclical capital buffer, our\ndividends and common stock repurchases,\ncould decrease. For example, in 2024,\nour SCB increased by 70 bps to 3.2\npercent and our G-SIB surcharge\nincreased 50 bps to 3.0 percent. Our\nG-SIB surcharge is expected to increase\nto 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent in 2027,\nand could further increase in the\nfuture. The Federal Reserve could also\nlimit or prohibit capital actions (e.g.,\nimpacts to dividends and common stock\nrepurchases) as a result of economic\ndisruptions or events.\n\nExtensive regulatory evaluation of our\ncapital planning practices by the\nFederal Reserve includes stress testing\non parts of our business using\nhypothetical economic scenarios prepared\nby the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios\nmay affect our CCAR stress test results,\nwhich may impact our SCB level and\nrequire us to hold additional capital.\nIn 2024, the Federal Reserve announced\nthat it intends to propose potential\nchanges to bank stress tests, which\ncould impact our SCB.\n\nChanges to and compliance with the\nregulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements may impact our operations\nby requiring us to liquidate assets,\nincrease borrowings, issue additional\nsecurities, reduce common stock\nrepurchases or dividends, limit\ncompensation practices, cease or alter\ncertain operations, pricing strategies\nand business activities or hold highly\nliquid assets, adversely affecting our\nresults of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  19Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nChanges in accounting standards or\nassumptions in applying accounting\npolicies could adversely affect us.\n\nAccounting policies and methods are\nfundamental to how we record and report\nour financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies\nrequire the use of estimates and\nassumptions that may affect the reported\nvalue of our assets or liabilities and\nresults of operations and are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are\ninherently uncertain. If assumptions,\nestimates or judgments are erroneously\napplied, we could be required to correct\nand restate prior-period financial\nstatements. Accounting standard-setters\nand those who interpret the accounting\nstandards, including the SEC, banking\nregulators and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may\nalso amend or even reverse their\nprevious interpretations or positions on\nhow various standards should be applied.\nThese changes may be difficult to\npredict and could impact the preparation\nand reporting of our financial\nstatements, including the application of\nnew or revised standards\nretrospectively, resulting in unexpected\nlosses, revisions to prior-period\nfinancial statements and other adverse\nimpacts to us, including legal and\nregulatory risk.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by changes\nin U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and\nregulations.\n\nWe could be adversely affected if U.S.\nand foreign governmental authorities\nfurther change tax laws, including\nchanges to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of\n2017 and Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022. Also, new guidelines issued by the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD), which are\ncurrently being enacted into law in some\nOECD countries in which we operate, are\nexpected to impose a 15 percent global\nminimum tax on a country-by-country\nbasis. Any implementation of and/or\nchange in U.S. and foreign tax laws and\nregulations or interpretations of\ncurrent or future tax laws and\nregulations could materially adversely\naffect our effective tax rate, tax\nliabilities and results of operations.\nU.S. and foreign tax laws are complex\nand our judgments, interpretations or\napplications of such tax laws could\ndiffer from that of the relevant\ngovernmental authority. This could\nresult in additional tax liabilities and\ninterest, penalties, the reduction of\ncertain tax benefits and/or the\nrequirement to make adjustments to\namounts recorded, which could be\nmaterial.\n\nAlso, we have U.K. net deferred tax\nassets (DTA) which consist primarily of\nnet operating losses that are expected\nto be realized in a U.K. subsidiary over\nan extended number of years. Adverse\ndevelopments with respect to tax laws or\nto other material factors, such as\nprolonged worsening of international\ncapital markets or changes in the\nability of our U.K. subsidiary to\nconduct business in the markets outside\nthe U.K., could lead our management to\nreassess and/or change its current\nconclusion that no valuation allowance\nis necessary with respect to our U.K.\nnet DTA.\n                                                                                  \n  Reputation                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nDamage to our reputation could harm our\nbusinesses, including our competitive\nposition and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain\nclients, investors and employees is\nimpacted by our reputation. Harm to our\nreputation can arise from various\nsources, including actual or perceived\nactivities of our officers, directors,\nemployees, other representatives,\nclients and third parties, including\ncounterparties, such as fraud,\nmisconduct and unethical behavior,\nadequacy of our ability to detect,\nprevent and/or respond to fraud\nperpetrated against our clients, and the\nhandling of related disputes regarding\nthe use of our products\n\nand services, including electronic\npayments, effectiveness of our internal\ncontrols, the fees charged to our\nclients, including overdraft and non-\nsufficient funds fees, compensation\npractices, lending practices,\nsuitability or reasonableness of\nparticular trading or investment\nstrategies, the services offered to our\nclients, the reliability of our research\nand models and prohibiting clients from\nengaging in certain transactions.\n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by\nactual or perceived failure to deliver\nthe products, standards of service and\nquality expected by our clients and the\ncommunity, including the overstatement\nor mislabeling of the environmental\nbenefits of our products, services or\ntransactions, the failure to protect our\nclients and/or recognize and address\nclient complaints, compliance failures,\ntechnology changes, the implementation,\nmanagement and use of emerging\ntechnologies, including AI, the failure\nto maintain effective data management,\ncybersecurity incidents and information\nand security breaches affecting us and\nour employees, clients and third\nparties, which have occurred and which\nwe expect to continue to occur with\nincreased frequency and severity,\nprolonged or repeated system outages,\nour privacy policies, the unintended\ndisclosure of or failure to safeguard\npersonal, proprietary or confidential\ninformation, the breach of our fiduciary\nobligations, employment practices and\nthe handling of widespread health\nemergencies or pandemics. Our reputation\nmay also be harmed by litigation and/or\nregulatory matters and their outcomes,\nand/or criticism or challenges by third\nparties, relating to the topics\ndiscussed above or otherwise. Challenges\nand criticisms to our environmental and\nsocial practices and disclosures, and\nthose of our clients and third parties,\nincluding from third parties, who may\nhave diverging views regarding those\npractices and disclosures, may also harm\nour reputation.\n\nIncreases in market interest rates have\nresulted in increased focus on asset and\nliability management, including HTM and\nAFS securities and related unrealized\nlosses. Perceptions of our liquidity and\nfinancial condition, actions by the\nfinancial services industry generally,\nor by certain members or individuals in\nthe industry may harm our reputation.\nAdverse publicity or negative\ninformation posted on social media by\nemployees, the media or otherwise,\nwhether or not factually correct, may\ntrigger a loss of trust or confidence on\nthe part of clients, counterparties,\nshareholders, investors, debt holders,\nmarket analysts, other relevant parties\nor regulators, adversely impacting our\nbusiness prospects and results of\noperations.\n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving\nLRRs and interpretations, including\nregarding fair lending activity, UDAAP,\nelectronic funds transfers, know-your-\ncustomer requirements, data protection\nand privacy (including the GDPR and the\nCCPA), cross-border data movement and\ndata localization, cybersecurity, the\nuse and development of AI, data and\ntechnology and other matters, as well as\nevolving and expansive interpretations\nof these LRRs. Principles concerning the\nappropriate scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy vary considerably\nacross jurisdictions, and regulatory and\npublic expectations regarding the\ndefinition and scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy and data protection\nremains fluid. These laws may be\ninterpreted and applied by various\njurisdictions inconsistent with our\ncurrent or future practices, or with one\nanother. If personal, confidential or\nproprietary information of clients in\nour possession, or in the possession of\nthird parties or financial data\naggregators, is mishandled, misused or\nmismanaged, or if we do not timely or\nadequately address such information, we\nmay face regulatory, legal and\noperational risks, which could adversely\naffect our reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America20                                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe could suffer reputational harm if we\nfail to properly identify and manage\npotential conflicts of interest, the\nmanagement of which has become\nincreasingly complex as we expand our\nbusiness activities through more\nnumerous transactions, obligations and\ninterests with and among our clients.\nThe actual or perceived failure to\nadequately address conflicts of interest\ncould affect the willingness of clients\nto use our products and services, or\nresult in litigation or enforcement\nactions, which could adversely affect\nour business.\n\nOur actual or perceived failure to\naddress these and other issues, such as\noperational risks, could give rise to\nreputational risk that could harm us and\nour business prospects, including the\nattraction and retention of clients and\nemployees, and give rise to additional\nregulatory restrictions, legal risks and\nreputational harm, which could, among\nother consequences, increase the size\nand number of litigation claims and\ndamages asserted or subject us to\nenforcement actions, fines and\npenalties, and cause us to incur related\ncosts and expenses.\n                                                                                  \n  Other                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nWe face significant and increasing\ncompetition in the financial services\nindustry.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and experience intense\ncompetition from local and global bank\nand nonbank financial institutions and\nnew entrants in domestic and foreign\nmarkets. There is increasing pressure to\nprovide products and services on more\nattractive terms, including lower fees,\nlower cost investment strategies and\nhigher interest rates on deposits, which\nmay impact our ability to effectively\ncompete. Also, we may be disadvantaged\nfrom more stringent regulatory\nrequirements applicable to us than to\nnonbank financial institutions or other\nactual or perceived competitors.\n\nThe growth of and mergers among\ntraditional financial services companies\nhave increased competition. Emerging\ntechnologies and the growth of\ne-commerce have lowered geographic and\nmonetary barriers of other financial\ninstitutions, made it easier for non-\ndepository institutions to offer\ntraditional banking products and\nservices and allowed non-traditional\nfinancial service providers and\ntechnology companies to compete with\ntraditional financial service companies\nin providing electronic and internet-\nbased financial solutions and services,\nincluding electronic securities trading\nwith low or no fees and commissions,\nmarketplace lending, financial data\naggregation and payment processing\nservices, including real-time payment\nplatforms. Further, clients may choose\nto conduct business with other market\nparticipants who engage in business or\noffer products in areas we deem\nspeculative or risky as an alternative\nto traditional products. Increased\ncompetition may reduce our market share,\nnet interest margin and revenues from\nour fee-based products and services and\nnegatively affect our earnings,\nincluding by pressuring us to lower\npricing, requiring additional investment\nto improve the quality and delivery of\nour technology and/or affecting our\nclients\u2019 willingness to do business with\nus.\n\nOur inability to adapt our business\nstrategies, products and services could\nharm our business.\n\nWe rely on a diversified mix of\nbusinesses that deliver a broad range of\nfinancial products and services through\nmultiple distribution channels. Our\nsuccess depends on our and our third-\nparty providers\u2019 ability to timely\nchange or adapt our business strategies,\nproducts and services and their\nrespective features, including available\npayment processing services and\ntechnology, such as AI and machine\nlearning, to rapidly evolving industry\nstandards and consumer preferences. Our\nstrategies could be further impacted by\nmacroeconomic stress,\n\nwidespread health emergencies or\npandemics, cyberattacks, and military\nconflicts or other significant\ngeopolitical events.\n\nWidespread adoption and rapid evolution\nof, as well as developments in the\nregulatory landscape relating to\nemerging technologies, including\nanalytic capabilities, AI (including\nmachine learning and generative AI),\nautomated decision-making, self-service\ndigital trading platforms and automated\ntrading markets, internet services, and\ndigital assets, such as central bank\ndigital currencies, cryptocurrencies\n(including stablecoins), tokens and\nother cryptoassets that utilize\ndistributed ledger technology (DLT), as\nwell as payment, clearing and settlement\nprocesses that use DLT, create\nadditional strategic risks, could\nnegatively impact our ability to compete\nand require substantial expenditures to\nthe extent we were to modify or adapt\nour existing products and services. As\nnew technologies evolve and mature, our\nbusinesses and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted, including\nas a result of new competitors to the\npayments and trading ecosystems and\nincreased volatility in deposits and/or\nsignificant long-term reduction in\ndeposits (i.e., financial\ndisintermediation).\n\nAlso, we may not be as timely or\nsuccessful in assessing the competitive\nlandscape and developing or introducing\nnew products and services, integrating\nnew products or services into our\nexisting offerings, responding, managing\nor adapting to changes in consumer\nbehavior, preferences, spending,\ninvesting and/or saving habits,\nachieving market acceptance of our\nproducts and services, reducing costs in\nresponse to pressures to deliver\nproducts and services at lower prices or\nsufficiently developing and maintaining\nclients. Further, our businesses may be\nnegatively impacted if we, or our third-\nparty providers, do not timely\ndevelopment and apply emerging\ntechnologies, like AI and quantum\ncomputing, or if our initiatives in\nthese areas are deficient or fail. Our\nor our third-party providers\u2019 inability\nor resistance to timely innovate or\nadapt operations, products and services\nto evolving regulatory and market\nenvironments, industry standards and\nconsumer preferences could result in\nservice disruptions, harm our business\nand adversely affect our results of\noperations and reputation.\n\nWe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial harm if our\nmodels fail to properly anticipate and\nmanage risk.\n\nWe use models enterprise-wide, including\nto forecast losses, project revenue and\nexpenses, assess and control our\noperations and financial condition,\nassist in capital planning, manage\nliquidity and measure, forecast and\nassess capital and liquidity\nrequirements for credit, market,\noperational and strategic risks. Under\nour Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model\nRisk Management is required to perform\nend-to-end model oversight, including\nindependent validation before initial\nuse, implementation monitoring, ongoing\nmonitoring reviews through outcomes\nanalysis and benchmarking, and periodic\nrevalidation. However, models are\nsubject to inherent limitations from\nsimplifying assumptions, uncertainty\nregarding economic and financial\noutcomes, and emerging risks, including\nfrom applications that rely on AI.\n\nOur models may not be sufficiently\npredictive of future results, such as\ndue to limited historical patterns,\nextreme or unanticipated market\nmovements or clients\u2019 behavior and\nliquidity, especially during severe\nmarket downturns or stress events (e.g.,\ngeopolitical or pandemic events), which\ncould limit their effectiveness and\nrequire timely recalibration. The models\nthat we use to assess and control our\nmarket risk exposures also reflect\nassumptions about the degree of\ncorrelation among prices of various\nasset classes or other market\nindicators, which may not be\nrepresentative of the next downturn and\nwould magnify the limitations inherent\nin using historical data to\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmanage risk. Market conditions in recent\nyears have involved unprecedented\ndislocations and highlight the\nlimitations inherent in using historical\ndata to manage risk. Our models may also\nbe adversely impacted by human error and\nmay not be effective if we fail to\nproperly oversee, regularly review and\ndetect their flaws during our review and\nmonitoring processes, they contain\nbiases, erroneous data, assumptions,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, or\nour applications running the models do\nnot perform as expected. Regardless of\nthe steps we take to design effective\ncontrols, governance, monitoring and\ntesting, and implement new technology\nand automated processes, we could suffer\noperational, reputational and financial\nharm, including funding or liquidity\nshortfalls, and adverse business\ndecisions and regulatory risk if models\nfail to properly anticipate and manage\nrisks.\n\nFailure to properly manage data may\nadversely affect our ability to manage\ncompliance risk and business needs, and\nresult in errors in our operations,\nreporting and decision-making, and non-\ncompliance with LRRs.\n\nWe rely on our ability to manage and\nprocess data accurately, timely and\ncompletely, including capturing,\ntransporting, aggregating, using,\ntransmitting data externally, and\nretaining and protecting data\nappropriately. While we continually\nupdate our policies, programs, processes\nand practices and take steps to leverage\nemerging technologies, such as\nautomation, AI and robotics, our data\nmanagement processes may not be\neffective and are subject to weaknesses\nand failures, including human error,\ndata limitations, process delays, system\nfailure or failed controls. Failure to\neffectively manage data accurately,\ntimely and completely may adversely\nimpact its quality and reliability and\nour ability to manage current and\nemerging risks, produce accurate\nfinancial, nonfinancial, regulatory,\noperational, environmental and social\nreporting, detect or surveil potential\nmisconduct or non-compliance with LRRs,\nand to manage our business needs,\nstrategic decision-making, resolution\nstrategy and operations. The failure to\nestablish and maintain effective,\nefficient and controlled data management\ncould adversely impact our development\nof products and client relationships and\nincrease operational losses and\nregulatory and reputational risk.\n\nOur operations, businesses and clients\ncould be adversely affected by the\nimpacts related to climate change.\n\nClimate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters present short-,\nmedium- and long-term risks. The\nphysical risks include an increase in\nthe frequency and severity of extreme\nweather events and natural disasters,\nincluding floods, wildfires, hurricanes\nand tornados, and chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels. Such\ndisasters and effects could adversely\nimpact our facilities, employees and\nclients\u2019 ability to repay outstanding\nloans, disrupt the operations of us and\nour clients or third parties, cause\nsupply chain or distribution network\ndisruptions, damage collateral and/or\nresult in market volatility, rapid\ndeposit outflows or drawdowns of credit\nfacilities, the deterioration of the\nvalue of collateral or insurance\nshortfalls.\n\nThere is also increasing risk related to\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\nChanges in consumer preferences or\nfinancial condition of our clients and\ncounterparties, market pressures,\nadvancements in technology and\nadditional legislation, regulatory,\ncompliance and legal requirements could\nalter our strategic planning and the\nscope of our existing businesses, limit\nour ability to pursue certain business\nactivities and offer certain products\nand services, amplify credit and market\nrisks, negatively impact asset values,\nrequire capital\n\nexpenditures and changes in technology\nand markets, including supply chain and\ninsurance availability and cost,\nincrease expenses and adversely impact\nour capital requirements and results of\noperations. Particularly, there is a\nglobal regulatory focus on climate\nchange and existing and pending\ndisclosure requirements in various\njurisdictions, with jurisdictional\ndivergence, which is expected to impact\nour legal, compliance and public\ndisclosure risks and costs.\n\nOur climate change strategies, policies,\nand disclosures, which may evolve over\ntime, our ability to achieve our\nclimate-related goals and targets and/or\nthe environmental or climate impacts\nattributable to our products, services\nor transactions may impact legal and\ncompliance risk and could result in\nreputational harm as a result of\nnegative public sentiment, regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation and reduced\ninvestor and stakeholder confidence. Due\nto divergent views of stakeholders, we\nare at increased risk that any action,\nor lack thereof, by us concerning our\nresponse to climate change will be\nperceived negatively by some\nstakeholders, which could adversely\nimpact our reputation and businesses.\nOur ability to meet our climate-related\ngoals and targets, including our goal to\nachieve certain greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions targets by 2030 and net zero\nGHG emissions in our financing\nactivities, operations and supply chain\nbefore 2050, is subject to risks and\nuncertainties, many of which are outside\nof our control, such as technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, public policies and\nbetter emissions data reporting, and\nongoing engagement with clients,\nsuppliers, investors, government\nofficials and other stakeholders. Due to\nthe evolving nature of climate-related\nrisks, which are expected to increase\nover time, it is difficult to predict,\nidentify, monitor and effectively\nmitigate climate-related risks and\nuncertainties.\n\nFurthermore, there are and will continue\nto be challenges related to the\navailability, quality and disclosure of\nclimate-related data, including data\nobtained from third parties, which may\nresult in legal, compliance and/or\nreputational harm.\n\nOur ability to attract, develop and\nretain qualified employees is critical\nto our success, business prospects and\ncompetitive position.\n\nOur performance and competitive position\nis heavily dependent on the talents,\ndevelopment and efforts of highly\nskilled individuals. Competition for\nqualified personnel is intense from\nwithin and outside the financial\nservices industry. Our competitors\ninclude global institutions and\ninstitutions subject to different\ncompensation and hiring regulations than\nthose imposed on us. Also, our ability\nto attract, develop and retain employees\ncould be impacted by our reputation,\nprofessional and development\nopportunities, changes in regulation or\nenforcement practices, changes in\nworkforce concerns, expectations,\npractices and preferences (including\nremote work), and increasing labor\nshortages and competition for labor,\nwhich could increase labor costs.\n\nWe must provide market-level\ncompensation to attract and retain\nqualified personnel. As a large\nfinancial and banking institution, we\nare and may become subject to additional\nlimitations on compensation practices by\nthe Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC\nand other global regulators, which may\nnot affect our competitors. Also,\nbecause a substantial portion of\ncompensation paid to many of our\nemployees is equity-based awards based\non the value of our common stock,\ndeclines in our profitability or outlook\ncould adversely affect the ability to\nattract and retain employees.

Net interest\nyield on a fully taxable-equivalent\n(FTE) basis decreased 13 basis points\n(bps) to 1.95 percent for 2024.

The following\nhighlights the significant changes. \u25cf\nCard income increased $230 million\nprimarily due to higher late fees,\nannual fees and card transfer fees. \u25cf\nService charges increased $371 million\nprimarily due to higher treasury service\ncharges. \u25cf Investment and brokerage\nservices increased $2.2 billion\nprimarily driven by higher asset\nmanagement fees due to higher average\nequity market valuations and positive\nassets under management (AUM) flows, as\nwell as higher brokerage fees due to\nincreased transactional volume,\npartially offset by the impact of lower\nAUM pricing. \u25cf Investment banking fees\nincreased $1.5 billion primarily due to\nhigher debt and equity issuance fees and\nhigher advisory fees. \u25cf Market making\nand similar activities increased $235\nmillion primarily driven by the net $1.6\nbillion charge resulting from the\nBloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index\u2019s\n(BSBY) cessation announced in 2023,\npartially offset by lower trading\nrevenue from macro products in Fixed\nIncome, Currencies and Commodities\n(FICC), and lower income from foreign\ncurrency risk management activities. \u25cf\nOther income decreased $340 million\nprimarily due to higher partnership\nlosses on tax credit investments, a\ncharge related to Visa Inc.\u2019s (Visa)\nincrease in its litigation escrow\naccount, and certain negative valuation\nadjustments, partially offset by lower\nlosses on sales of available-for-sale\ndebt securities and gains on sales of\nequity investments.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses The\nprovision for credit losses increased\n$1.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2024\ncompared to 2023. The provision for\ncredit losses for 2024 was primarily\ndriven by credit card as well as small\nbusiness loan growth, and asset quality\ndeterioration in the commercial real\nestate office and credit card\nportfolios. For the prior year, the\nprovision for credit losses was\nprimarily driven by credit card loan\ngrowth and asset quality deterioration,\npartially offset by improved\nmacroeconomic conditions that primarily\nbenefited the commercial portfolio.

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 85.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America30                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

For more\ninformation on the nature of these\nrisks, see Managing Risk on page 45. The\ncapital allocated to the business\nsegments is referred to as allocated\ncapital. Allocated equity in the\nreporting units is comprised of\nallocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting\nunit.

Net interest income increased\n$717 million to $11.9 billion primarily\ndue to the impact of higher loan\nbalances. Noninterest income increased\n$85 million to $5.5 billion, primarily\ndriven by higher card income . The\nprovision for credit losses was $4.7\nbillion, relatively unchanged from the\nsame period a year ago . Noninterest\nexpense increased $339 million to $8.4\nbillion primarily driven by investments\nin the business, including operations,\ntechnology and people.

Net DVA\nlosses were $113 million compared to\nlosses of $236 million in 2023.\nExcluding net DVA, net income increased\n$851 million to $5.7 billion. These\nincreases were primarily driven by\nhigher revenue, partially offset by\nhigher noninterest expense.\n\nRevenue increased $2.3 billion to $21.8\nbillion primarily due to higher sales\nand trading revenue and investment\nbanking fees. Sales and trading revenue\nincreased $1.4 billion, and excluding\nnet DVA, increased $1.3 billion. These\nincreases were driven by higher revenue\nin both Equities and FICC. Noninterest\nexpense increased $720 million to $13.9\nbillion, primarily driven by revenue-\nrelated expenses and continued\ninvestments in the business, including\ntechnology.\n\nAverage total assets increased $42.0\nbillion to $911.7 billion, driven by\nhigher levels of inventory, loan growth\nand increased financing activity.

The decrease in the income tax\nbenefit was primarily due to the\nbenefits recorded against pretax charges\nin 2023 for the FDIC special assessment\nand the impact of BSBY\u2019s cessation.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America44                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Managing Risk                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nRisk is inherent in all our business\nactivities. Sound risk management\nenables us to serve our customers and\ndeliver for our shareholders. If not\nmanaged well, risk can result in\nfinancial loss, regulatory sanctions and\npenalties, litigation, and damage to our\nreputation, each of which may adversely\nimpact our ability to execute our\nbusiness strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee\n(ERC) and the Board.\n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the\nCorporation are strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational.\n\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current\nor projected financial condition arising\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate.\n\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss\narising from the inability or failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its\nobligations.\n\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes\nin market conditions adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nMarket risk is composed of price risk\nand interest rate risk.\n\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the risk of the\ninability to meet expected or unexpected\ncash flow and collateral needs while\ncontinuing to support our businesses and\ncustomers under a range of economic\nconditions.\n\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal\naction or regulatory sanctions, material\nfinancial loss or damage to the\nreputation of the Corporation arising\nfrom the failure of the Corporation to\ncomply with the requirements of\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\n(LRRs) and our internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems, people or\nexternal events.\n\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations.\n\nThe following sections address in more\ndetail the specific procedures, measures\nand analyses of the major categories of\nrisk.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a\nculture of managing risk well is\nfundamental to our values and our\npurpose, and how we drive Responsible\nGrowth. It requires us to focus on risk\nin all activities and encourages the\nnecessary mindset and behavior to enable\neffective risk management and promote\nsound risk-taking within our risk\nappetite. Sustaining a culture of\nmanaging risk well throughout the\norganization is critical to the success\nof the Corporation and is a clear\nexpectation of our executive management\nteam and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with\nBoard oversight, the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business. Management\nreviews and approves the strategic and\nfinancial operating plans, as well as\nthe capital plan and Risk Appetite\nStatement, and recommends them annually\nto the Board for approval. Our strategic\nplan takes into consideration return\nobjectives and financial resources,\nwhich must align with risk capacity and\nrisk appetite. Management sets financial\nobjectives for each business by\nallocating capital and setting a target\nfor return on capital for each business.\nCapital allocations are regularly\nevaluated as part of our overall\ngovernance processes as the businesses\nand the economic environment in which we\noperate continue to evolve. For more\ninformation regarding capital\nallocations, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 35.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite\nindicates the amount of capital,\nearnings or liquidity we are willing to\nput at risk to achieve our strategic\nobjectives and business plans,\nconsistent with applicable regulatory\nrequirements. It also provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile across all risk types\nagainst our risk appetite and risk\ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally\narticulated in the Risk Appetite\nStatement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is\nlimited. Accordingly, we prioritize the\nrisks we take in order to maintain a\nstrong and flexible financial position\nso we can weather challenging economic\ntimes and take advantage of organic\ngrowth opportunities while complying\nwith all applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Therefore, we set\nobjectives and targets for capital and\nliquidity that permit us to continue to\noperate in a safe and sound manner at\nall times, including during periods of\nstress. We also maintain strong\noperational risk management and\noperational resiliency capabilities so\nwe can meet the expectations of our\ncustomers and clients through a range of\noperating conditions.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk\nlimits that align with the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk appetite. Management is responsible\nfor tracking and reporting performance\nmeasurements as well as any breaches or\nexceptions to risk appetite limits. The\nBoard, and its committees when\nappropriate, oversee financial\nperformance, execution of the strategic\nand financial operating plans, adherence\nto risk appetite limits and the adequacy\nof internal controls.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our\nrisk management activities, see the\ndiscussion below and pages 48 through\n82.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Governance                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework describes delegations\nof authority whereby the Board and its\ncommittees may delegate authority to\nmanagement-level committees or executive\nofficers. Such delegations may authorize\ncertain decision-making and approval\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in\ndocuments such as committee charters,\njob descriptions, meeting minutes and\nresolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the\ninterrelationship among the Board, Board\ncommittees and management committees\nthat have the majority of risk oversight\nresponsibilities for the Corporation.\n                                                                                  \n  45Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Board of Directors and Board Committees                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Board is composed of 14 directors,\nall but one of whom are independent. The\nBoard authorizes management to maintain\nan effective Risk Framework and oversees\ncompliance with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, the Board or its\ncommittees conduct inquiries of, and\nreceive reports from senior management\non, risk-related matters to assess scope\nor resource limitations that could\nimpede the ability of Global Risk\nManagement (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit\nto execute its responsibilities. The\nBoard committees discussed below have\nthe principal responsibility for\nenterprise-wide oversight of our risk\nmanagement activities. Through these\nactivities, the Board and applicable\ncommittees are provided with information\non our risk profile and oversee senior\nmanagement addressing key risks we face.\nOther Board committees, as described\nbelow, provide additional oversight of\nspecific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the\nabove chart regularly reports to the\nBoard on risk-related matters within the\ncommittee\u2019s responsibilities, which is\nintended to collectively provide the\nBoard with integrated insight about our\nmanagement of enterprise-wide risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Audit Committee                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Audit Committee oversees the\nqualifications, performance and\nindependence of the Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, the\nperformance of our corporate audit\nfunction, the integrity of our\nconsolidated financial statements, our\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, and makes inquiries of\nsenior management or the Chief Audit\nExecutive (CAE) to determine whether\nthere are scope or resource limitations\nthat impede the ability of Corporate\nAudit to execute its responsibilities.\nThe Audit Committee is also responsible\nfor overseeing compliance risks pursuant\nto the New York Stock Exchange listing\nstandards.\n                                                                                  \n  Enterprise Risk Committee                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe ERC oversees the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, risk appetite and senior\nmanagement\u2019s responsibilities for the\nidentification, measurement, monitoring\nand control of key risks facing the\nCorporation.

Executive officers and other\nemployees make decisions individually on\na day-to-day basis, consistent with the\nauthority they have been delegated.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \nExecutive officers and other employees\nmay also serve on committees and\nparticipate in committee decisions.\n                                                                                  \n  Lines of Defense                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe have clear ownership and\naccountability for managing risk across\nthree lines of defense: Front Line Units\n(FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also\nhave control functions outside of FLUs\nand GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human\nResources). The three lines of defense\nare integrated into our management-level\ngovernance structure. Each of these\nfunctional roles is further described in\nthis section.\n                                                                                  \n  Front Line Units and Control Functions                                          \n                                                                                  \nFLUs, which include the business\nsegments and underlying businesses, as\nwell as the organizations that support\ntechnology and operations for the\nCorporation, are responsible for\nappropriately assessing and effectively\nmanaging all of the risks associated\nwith their activities. Control functions\nprovide guidance and subject matter\nexpertise on day-to-day activities\naffecting the Corporation, as well as by\noverseeing and managing risks that\nemanate from their own respective\nactivities.\n                                                                                  \n   Global Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \nGRM is part of our control functions and\noperates as our independent risk\nmanagement function. GRM, led by the\nChief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible\nfor independently assessing and\noverseeing risks within FLUs and other\ncontrol functions. GRM establishes\nwritten enterprise policies and\nprocedures outlining how aggregate risks\nare identified, measured, monitored and\ncontrolled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and\nindependence needed to develop and\nimplement a meaningful risk management\nframework and practices to guide the\nCorporation in managing risk. The CRO\nhas unrestricted access to the Board and\nreports directly to both the ERC and the\nCEO. GRM is organized into horizontal\nrisk teams that cover a specific risk\narea and vertical CRO teams that cover a\nparticular FLU or control function.\nThese teams work collaboratively in\nexecuting their respective duties.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporate Audit                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain\ntheir independence from the FLUs, GRM\nand other control functions by reporting\ndirectly to the Audit Committee. The CAE\nadministratively reports to the CEO.\nCorporate Audit provides independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key processes and controls\nacross the Corporation. Corporate Audit\nincludes Credit Review, which provides\nan independent assessment of credit\nlending decisions and the effectiveness\nof credit processes across the\nCorporation\u2019s credit platform through\nexaminations and monitoring.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Processes                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework requires that strong\nrisk management practices are integrated\nin key strategic, capital and financial\nplanning processes and in day-to-day\nbusiness processes across the\nCorporation, thereby ensuring risks are\nappropriately considered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely manner. We\nemploy an effective risk management\nprocess, referred to as Identify,\nMeasure, Monitor and Control, as part of\nour daily activities.\n\nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively managed,\nrisks must be proactively identified and\nwell understood. Proper risk\nidentification focuses on recognizing\nand understanding key risks inherent in\nour business activities or key risks\nthat may arise from\n\nexternal factors. Each employee is\nexpected to identify and escalate risks\npromptly. Risk identification is an\nongoing process that incorporates input\nfrom FLUs and control functions. It is\ndesigned to be forward-looking and to\ncapture relevant risk factors across all\nof our lines of business.\n\nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it\nmust be prioritized and accurately\nmeasured through a systematic process\nincluding qualitative statements and\nquantitative limits. Risk is measured at\nvarious levels, including, but not\nlimited to, risk type, FLU and legal\nentity, and also on an aggregate basis.\nThis risk measurement process helps to\ncapture changes in our risk profile due\nto changes in strategic direction,\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and\nthe overall economic environment. Senior\nmanagement considers how risk exposures\nmight evolve under a variety of stress\nscenarios.\n\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk levels\nregularly to track adherence to risk\nappetite, policies and standards. We\nalso regularly update risk assessments\nand review risk exposures. Through our\nmonitoring, we know our level of risk\nrelative to limits and can take action\nin a timely manner. We also know when\nrisk limits are breached and have\nprocesses to appropriately report and\nescalate exceptions. This includes\ntimely requests for approval to managers\nand alerts to executive management,\nmanagement-level committees or the Board\n(directly or through an appropriate\ncommittee).\n\nControl \u2013 We establish and communicate\nrisk limits and controls through\npolicies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses. The limits and controls can\nbe adjusted by senior management or the\nBoard when conditions or risk tolerances\nwarrant. These limits may be absolute\n(e.g., loan amount, trading volume,\noperational loss) or relative (e.g.,\npercentage of loan book in higher-risk\ncategories). Our FLUs are held\naccountable for performing within the\nestablished limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk\nrepresent a part of our overall risk\nmanagement process. We instill a strong\nand comprehensive culture of managing\nrisk well through communications,\ntraining, policies, procedures and\norganizational roles and\nresponsibilities. Establishing a culture\nreflective of our purpose to help make\nour customers\u2019 financial lives better\nand delivering on Responsible Growth is\nalso critical to effective risk\nmanagement. We are committed to the\nhighest principles of ethical and\nprofessional conduct. Conduct risk is\nthe risk of improper actions, behaviors\nor practices by the Corporation, its\nemployees or representatives that are\nillegal, unethical and/or contrary to\nour core values that could result in\nharm to the Corporation, our\nshareholders or our customers, damage\nthe integrity of the financial markets,\nor negatively impact our reputation. We\nhave established protocols and\nstructures so that conduct risk is\ngoverned and reported across the\nCorporation appropriately. All employees\nare held accountable for adhering to the\nCode of Conduct, operating within our\nrisk appetite and managing risk in their\ndaily business activities. In addition,\nour performance management and\ncompensation practices encourage\nresponsible risk-taking that is\nconsistent with our Risk Framework and\nrisk appetite.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporation-wide Stress Testing                                                 \n                                                                                  \nIntegral to our Capital Planning,\nFinancial Planning and Strategic\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital\nscenario management and stress\nforecasting on a regular basis to better\nunderstand balance sheet, earnings and\ncapital sensitivities to a wide range of\neconomic and business scenarios,\nincluding economic and market conditions\nthat are more severe than anticipated.\nThese stress forecasts provide an\nunderstanding of the potential\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nimpacts from our risk profile on the\nbalance sheet, earnings and capital, and\nserve as a key component of our capital\nand risk management practices. The\nintent of stress testing is to develop a\ncomprehensive understanding of potential\nimpacts of on- and off-balance sheet\nrisks at the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries and how they impact\nfinancial resiliency, which provides\nconfidence to management, regulators and\nour investors.\n                                                                                  \n  Contingency Planning                                                            \n                                                                                  \nWe have developed and maintain\ncomprehensive contingency plans that are\ndesigned to prepare us in advance to\nrespond in the event of potential\nadverse economic, operational, financial\nor market stress conditions. These\ncontingency plans include our Financial\nContingency and Recovery Plan, which\nprovides monitoring, escalation, actions\nand routines designed to enable us to\nincrease capital and/or liquidity,\naccess funding sources and reduce risk\nthrough consideration of potential\noptions that include asset sales,\nbusiness sales, capital or debt\nissuances, and other risk reducing\nstrategies at various levels of capital\nor liquidity depletion during a period\nof stress. We also maintain a Resolution\nPlan to limit adverse systemic impacts\nthat could be associated with a\npotential resolution of Bank of America.\n                                                                                  \n   Strategic Risk Management                                                      \n                                                                                  \nStrategic risk is embedded in every\nbusiness and is one of the major risk\ncategories along with credit, market,\nliquidity, compliance, operational and\nreputational risks. This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate, such as competitor\nactions, changing customer preferences,\nproduct obsolescence and technology\ndevelopments, including rapid advances\nin artificial intelligence (AI), such as\nmachine learning and generative AI.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk\nthat the Corporation\u2019s capital levels\nare not adequate to meet minimum\nregulatory requirements and support\nexecution of business activities or\nabsorb losses from risks during normal\nor adverse economic and market\nconditions. As such, capital risk is\nmanaged in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe manage strategic risk through the\nStrategic Risk Enterprise Policy and\nintegration into the strategic planning\nprocess, among other activities. Our\nstrategic plan is consistent with our\nrisk appetite, capital plan and\nliquidity requirements, and specifically\naddresses strategic risks impacting each\nbusiness.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews\nand approves the strategic plan, capital\nplan, financial operating plan and Risk\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by\nthe Board, senior management directs the\nlines of business to execute our\nstrategic plan consistent with our core\noperating principles and risk appetite.\nThe executive management team monitors\nbusiness performance throughout the year\nand provides the Board with regular\nprogress reports on whether strategic\nobjectives and timelines are being met,\nincluding reports on strategic risks and\nif additional or alternative actions\nneed to be considered or implemented.\nThe regular executive reviews focus on\nassessing forecasted earnings and\nreturns on capital, the current risk\nprofile, current capital and liquidity\nrequirements, staffing levels and\nchanges required to support the\nstrategic plan, stress testing results,\nand other qualitative factors such as\nmarket growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as\ncapital actions, material acquisitions\nor divestitures, and resolution plans\nare reviewed and approved by the Board.\nAt the business level, processes are in\nplace to discuss the strategic risk\nimplications of new, expanded or\nmodified businesses, products or\nservices, regulatory change and other\nstrategic initiatives, and to provide\nformal review and approval where\nrequired. With oversight by the Board\nand the ERC, executive management\nperforms similar analyses throughout the\nyear, and evaluates changes to the\nfinancial forecast or the risk, capital\nor liquidity positions as deemed\nappropriate to balance and optimize\nachieving the targeted risk appetite,\nshareholder returns and maintaining the\ntargeted financial strength. Proprietary\nmodels are used to measure the capital\nrequirements for credit, country,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks.\nThe allocated capital assigned to each\nbusiness is based on its unique risk\nprofile. With oversight by the Board,\nexecutive management assesses the risk-\nadjusted returns of each business in\napproving strategic and financial\noperating plans. The businesses use\nallocated capital to define business\nstrategies, and price products and\ntransactions.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning.\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety\nand soundness at all times, even under\nadverse scenarios, take advantage of\norganic growth opportunities, meet\nobligations to creditors and\ncounterparties, maintain ready access to\nfinancial markets, continue to serve as\na credit intermediary, remain a source\nof strength for our subsidiaries, and\nsatisfy current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements. Capital management\nis integrated into our risk and\ngovernance processes, as capital is a\nkey consideration in the development of\nour strategic plan, risk appetite and\nrisk limits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic\nbasis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking\nassessment of our projected capital\nneeds and resources, incorporating\nearnings, balance sheet and risk\nforecasts under baseline and adverse\neconomic and market conditions. We\nutilize periodic stress tests to assess\nthe potential impacts to our balance\nsheet, earnings, regulatory capital and\nliquidity under a variety of stress\nscenarios. We perform qualitative risk\nassessments to identify and assess\nmaterial risks not fully captured in our\nforecasts or stress tests. We assess the\npotential capital impacts of proposed\nchanges to regulatory capital\nrequirements. Management assesses ICAAP\nresults and provides documented\nquarterly assessments of the adequacy of\nour capital guidelines and capital\nposition to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital\nannually during the strategic and\ncapital planning processes.

Based on 2024\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) stress test results, our\nSCB is 3.2 percent effective from\nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2025.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America48                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOn July 24, 2024, the Board authorized a\n$25 billion common stock repurchase\nprogram, effective August 1, 2024, which\nreplaced the Corporation\u2019s previous\nprogram that was initially authorized by\nthe Board in 2021, modified in 2023 and\nexpired on August 1, 2024.\n\nPursuant to Board authorizations, during\n2024 we repurchased $13.1 billion of\ncommon stock. For more information, see\nPart II, Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s\nCommon Equity, Related Stockholder\nMatters and issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities on page 24.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3\nestablished minimum capital ratios and\nbuffer requirements and outlined two\nmethods of calculating risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), the Standardized approach\nand the Advanced approaches. The\nStandardized approach relies primarily\non supervisory risk weights based on\nexposure type, and the Advanced\napproaches determine risk weights based\non internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nRWA under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the PCA\nframework. As of December 31, 2024, the\nCommon equity tier 1 (CET1) capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios\nunder the Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\n\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nJanuary 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2024, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements were 10.0\npercent under both the Standardized\napproach and the Advanced approaches.\nEffective October 1, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s minimum CET1 requirements\nwere 10.7 percent under the Standardized\napproach and 10.0 percent under the\nAdvanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.5\npercent from 3.0 percent on January 1,\n2027, unless its surcharge calculated as\nof December 31, 2025 is lower than 3.5\npercent. At December 31, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nDecember 31, 2024, our insured\ndepository institution subsidiaries\nexceeded their requirement to maintain a\nminimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered\nwell capitalized under the PCA\nframework.

transition period related to\nthe adoption of the current expected\ncredit losses (CECL) accounting standard\non January 1, 2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum\nis the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 3.0 percent at December 31,\n2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,\n2023, and SCB (under the Standardized\napproach) of 3.2 percent at December 31,\n2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,\n2023. The countercyclical capital buffer\nwas zero for both periods. The SLR\nregulatory minimum includes a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, CET1 capital was\n$201.1 billion, an increase of $6.2\nbillion from December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital increased $135 million primarily\ndriven by the increase in CET1 capital,\npartially offset by preferred stock\nredemptions. Total capital under the\nStandardized approach increased $4.0\nbillion primarily due to an increase in\nsubordinated debt, adjusted allowance\nfor credit losses included in Tier 2\ncapital, and the\n\nincrease in Tier 1 capital. RWA under\nthe Standardized approach, which yielded\nthe lower CET1 capital ratio at December\n31, 2024, increased $44.5 billion during\n2024 to $1,696 billion primarily driven\nby client activity in Global Markets and\nlending activity in GWIM, Global Banking\nand Consumer Banking . Supplementary\nleverage exposure at December 31, 2024\nincreased $142.0 billion primarily\ndriven by increased activity in Global\nMarkets and ALM activities in All Other.\n

(FINRA).\nPursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may\nimpose higher net capital requirements\nthan Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act\nwith respect to each of the broker-\ndealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nDecember 31, 2024, BofAS had tentative\nnet capital of $23.6 billion. BofAS also\nhad regulatory net capital of $21.0\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of $4.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nDecember 31, 2024, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $7.2 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $155\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\nis regulated by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the Financial\nConduct Authority and is subject to\ncertain regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2024, MLI\u2019s capital\nresources were $33.8 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $11.0 billion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution\nwith its head office located in France,\nis regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\n\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the\nAutorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and\nsupervised under the Single Supervisory\nMechanism by the European Central Bank.\nAt December 31, 2024, BofASE's capital\nresources were $10.9 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $3.3 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE remained\nconditionally registered with the SEC as\nsecurity-based swap dealers, and\nmaintained net liquid assets at December\n31, 2024 that exceeded the applicable\nminimum requirements under the Exchange\nAct. The entities are also registered as\nswap dealers with the CFTC and met\napplicable capital requirements at\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  Liquidity Risk                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur primary liquidity risk management\nobjective is to meet expected or\nunexpected cash flow and collateral\nrequirements, including payments under\nlong-term debt agreements, commitments\nto extend credit and customer deposit\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support\nour businesses and customers under a\nrange of economic conditions. To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage market\nfluctuations from the elevated interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding and\nliquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access to\nfunding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.\n\nWe provide centralized funding and\nliquidity management through a variety\nof activities, including monitoring of\n                                                                                  \n  53Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nestablished limits and liquidity risk\nappetites, reviews of liquidity risk\nmanagement controls and production, and\nreviews of regulatory and internally\ndefined liquidity risk metrics. In\naddition, GRM provides oversight of\ncentralized liquidity and funding\nmanagement as well as oversight of\nliquidity management across FLUs and\nlegal entities. GRM oversees the\nliquidity risk management governance\nstructure, establishes liquidity risk\npolicies, reports and monitors liquidity\nrisk limits and provides review and\nchallenge of the Corporation's liquidity\nrisk management processes. The Board,\nits risk committee and various\nmanagement committees oversee the\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity activities and\nrisk governance. The Board and/or ERC\napprove our liquidity risk policy,\nFinancial Contingency and Recovery Plan\nand liquidity risk appetite limits.\nManagement committees responsible for\nliquidity governance include the\nCorporation\u2019s Management Risk Committee,\nAsset and Liability Governance\nCommittee, Liquidity Risk Committee and\nAsset and Liability Management\nInvestment Committee. For more\ninformation, see Managing Risk on page\n45. Under this governance framework, we\ndeveloped certain funding and liquidity\nrisk management practices which include:\nmaintaining liquidity at Bank of America\nCorporation (Parent) and selected\nsubsidiaries, including our bank\nsubsidiaries and other regulated\nentities; determining what amounts of\nliquidity are appropriate for these\nentities based on analysis of debt\nmaturities and other potential cash\noutflows, including those that we may\nexperience during stressed market\nconditions; diversifying funding\nsources, considering our asset profile\nand legal entity structure; and\nperforming contingency planning. NB\nHoldings Corporation Bank of America\nCorporation, as the parent company\n(Parent), which is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries, has an\nintercompany arrangement with our\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).\nWe have transferred, and agreed to\ntransfer, additional Parent assets not\nrequired to satisfy anticipated near-\nterm expenditures to NB Holdings. The\nParent is expected to continue to have\naccess to the same flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts of cash\nnecessary to service its debt, pay\ndividends and perform other obligations\nas it would have had it not entered into\nthese arrangements and transferred any\nassets. These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. In consideration\nfor the transfer of assets, NB Holdings\nissued a subordinated note to the Parent\nin a principal amount equal to the value\nof the transferred assets. The aggregate\nprincipal amount of the note will\nincrease by the amount of any future\nasset transfers. NB Holdings also\nprovided the Parent with a committed\nline of credit that allows the Parent to\ndraw funds necessary to service near-\nterm cash needs. These arrangements\nsupport our preferred single point of\nentry resolution strategy, under which\nonly the Parent would be resolved under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These\narrangements include provisions to\nterminate the line of credit, forgive\nthe subordinated note and require the\nParent to transfer its remaining\nfinancial assets to NB Holdings if our\nprojected liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nof the Parent becomes imminent. Global\nLiquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered\nAssets We maintain liquidity available\nto the Corporation, including the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, in the form\nof cash and high- quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer,\n\nreferred to as Global Liquidity Sources\n(GLS), is comprised of assets that are\nreadily available to the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, including holding\ncompany, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash is primarily\non deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent, central banks\noutside of the U.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and other investment-grade\nsecurities, and a select group of\nnon-U.S. government securities. We can\nobtain cash for these securities, even\nin stressed conditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or outright sales.\nWe hold our GLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the liquidity\nrequirements of our global businesses,\nand we consider the impact of potential\nregulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\n                                                                                  \n                                                   Three Months Ended             \n  Table 15                 Average Global                 December 31             \n  (Dollars in billions)    Liquidity Sources                     2024       2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                                 $                 777    $   735  \n  Nonbank and other                                               176        162  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average Global                          $                 953    $   897  \n  Liquidity Sources                                                               \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained by borrowing\nagainst this pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was $328\nbillion and $312 billion at December 31,\n2024 and 2023. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 16 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Table 16               Average Global            Three Months Ended             \n  (Dollars in            Liquidity Sources                December 31             \n  billions)              Composition                             2024       2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on deposit                               $                 315    $   380  \n  U.S. Treasury                                                   313        197  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-backed                                                                 \n  securities, and                                                 296        299  \n  other                                                                           \n  investment-grade                                                                \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S. government                                              29         21  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                              $                 953    $   897  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nrules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $623 billion and $590 billion for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the same periods, the average\nconsolidated LCR was 113 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal\nbusiness flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize\nliquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of\nliquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and\nutilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including\npotential credit rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more\nsevere events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on\nour historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial\ninstitutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our\nscenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of\nunsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured\nfinancing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan\ncommitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral\nthat counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral\nand margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity\nrequired to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in\ncertain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades,\ncould negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the\nrelated financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material\nto our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access\nduring each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources\nwith corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress\nmodeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits\nand guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Net Stable Funding Ratio\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to\nmaintain a minimum level of stable funding\n\nover a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of\nbanks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic\nconditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity\nrisks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our\ninsured depository institutions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the average consolidated NSFR was 121 percent and 119 percent.\nDiversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits,\nand secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated\nfunding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and\ninvestor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include\ngreater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and\ngreater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries.\nWhere regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make\nParent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits,\nwhich were $1.97 trillion and $1.92 trillion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 .\nDeposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking\nsegments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography,\nand the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. At December 31,\n2024, 48 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15 percent in GWIM and\n29 percent in Global Banking . As of the same period, approximately 68 percent of\nconsumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global\nBanking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 27 percent and 28 percent of our\ndeposits were noninterest bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer\nand commercial clients. During the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrates paid on deposits were 64 bps and 47 bps in Consumer Banking , 275 bps and\n287 bps in GWIM , and 297 bps and 296 bps in Global Bankin g. For information on\nannual rates paid on consolidated deposit balances, see Table 8 on page 33 . We\nconsider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and\nconsistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less\nsensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit\nratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be\nfinanced through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and\nsecuritizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our\ntrading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured\nbasis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will\nvary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these\nactivities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less\nsensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase\nagreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured\nfinancing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles\nwhich resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the\navailability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured\nfunding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties,\nproviding a\n                                                                                  \n  55Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nrange of securities collateral and\npursuing longer durations, when\nappropriate.

Total long-term\ndebt decreased $18.9 billion to $283.3\nbillion during 2024, primarily due to\nmaturities and redemptions, partially\noffset by debt issuances and valuation\nadjustments. We may, from time to time,\npurchase outstanding debt instruments in\nvarious transactions, depending on\nmarket conditions, liquidity and other\nfactors. Our other regulated entities\nmay also make markets in our debt\ninstruments to provide liquidity for\ninvestors. At December 31, 2024, Bank of\nAmerica Corporation's senior notes of\n$180.3 billion included $167.5 billion\nof outstanding notes, substantially all\nof which are both TLAC eligible and\ncallable at least one year before their\nstated maturities. Of these senior\nnotes, $22.1 billion will be callable\nand become TLAC ineligible during 2025 ,\nand $21.6 billion , $24.9 billion ,\n$19.5 billion and $8.0 billion will do\nso during each of 2026 through 2029 ,\nrespectively, and $71.4 billion\nthereafter. We issue long-term unsecured\ndebt in a variety of maturities and\ncurrencies to achieve cost-efficient\nfunding and to maintain an appropriate\nmaturity profile. While the cost and\navailability of unsecured funding may be\nnegatively impacted by general market\nconditions or by matters specific to the\nfinancial services industry or the\nCorporation, we seek to mitigate\nrefinancing risk by actively managing\nthe amount of our borrowings that we\nanticipate will mature within any month\nor quarter. We may issue unsecured debt\nin the form of structured notes for\nclient purposes, certain of which\nqualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During\n2024, we issued $28.2 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. We typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to pay on these\nliabilities with derivatives and/or\ninvestments in the underlying\ninstruments, so that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured\nnote obligations for cash or other\nsecurities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate. Substantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt obligations\ncontain no provisions that could trigger\na requirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. We use derivative\ntransactions to manage the duration,\ninterest rate and currency risks of our\nborrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Contingency Planning\nWe maintain contingency funding plans\nthat outline our potential responses to\nliquidity stress events at various\nlevels of severity. These policies and\nplans are based on stress scenarios and\ninclude potential funding strategies and\ncommunication and notification\nprocedures that we would implement in\nthe event we experienced stressed\nliquidity conditions. We periodically\nreview and test the contingency funding\nplans to validate efficacy and assess\nreadiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries\ncan access contingency funding through\nthe Federal Reserve Discount Window.\nCertain non-U.S. subsidiaries have\naccess to central bank facilities in the\njurisdictions in which they operate.\nWhile we do not rely on these sources in\nour liquidity modeling, we maintain the\npolicies, procedures and governance\nprocesses that would enable us to access\nthese sources if necessary. Credit\nRatings Our borrowing costs and ability\nto raise funds are impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition, credit\nratings may be important to customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and when we seek to\nengage in certain transactions,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America56                                                               \n                                                                                  \nincluding over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives. Thus, it is our objective\nto maintain high-quality credit ratings,\nand management maintains an active\ndialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions\nexpressed by rating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of our\nobligations or securities, including\nlong-term debt, short-term borrowings,\npreferred stock and other securities,\nincluding asset securitizations. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by the rating agencies, and they\nconsider a number of factors, including\nour own financial strength, performance,\nprospects and operations as well as\nfactors not under our control. The\nrating agencies could make adjustments\nto our ratings at any time, and they\nprovide no assurances that they will\nmaintain our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther factors that influence our credit\nratings include changes to the rating\nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry\nor certain security types;

In\naddition, under the terms of certain OTC\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements, in the event of downgrades\nof our or our rated subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings, the counterparties to those\nagreements may require us to provide\nadditional collateral, or to terminate\nthese contracts or agreements, which\ncould cause us to sustain losses and/or\nadversely impact our liquidity. If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our Parent,\nbank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were\ndowngraded by one or more levels, the\npotential loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing\nand the effect on our incremental cost\nof funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nscope of the consequences of a credit\nrating downgrade to a financial\ninstitution is inherently uncertain, as\nit depends upon numerous dynamic,\ncomplex and inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including whether any\ndowngrade of a company\u2019s long-term\ncredit ratings precipitates downgrades\nto its short-term credit ratings, and\nassumptions about the potential\nbehaviors of various customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.

If holders of the Guaranteed\nSecurities make claims on their\nGuaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy,\nresolution or similar proceeding, any\nrecoveries on those claims will be\nlimited to those available under the\napplicable guarantee by the Corporation,\nas described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and\ndepends upon its subsidiaries for\nliquidity.

In addition, the\nobligations of the Corporation under the\nguarantees of the Guaranteed Securities\nwill be structurally subordinated to all\nexisting and future liabilities of its\nsubsidiaries, and claimants should look\nonly to assets of the Corporation for\npayments. If the Corporation, as\nguarantor of the Guaranteed Notes,\ntransfers all or substantially all of\nits assets to one or more direct or\nindirect majority-owned subsidiaries,\nunder the indenture governing the\nGuaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries will not be required to\nassume the Corporation\u2019s obligations\nunder its guarantee of the Guaranteed\nNotes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may\naffect payments to holders of the\nGuaranteed Securities, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 NB Holdings Corporation in this\nsection, Item 1.

Credit risk can also arise\nfrom operational failures that result in\nan erroneous advance, commitment or\ninvestment of funds. We define the\ncredit exposure to a borrower or\ncounterparty as the loss potential\narising from all product classifications\nincluding loans and leases, deposit\noverdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending\ncommitments, which include loan\ncommitments, letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees. Derivative\npositions are recorded at fair value,\nand assets held-for-sale are recorded at\neither fair value or the lower of cost\nor\n\nfair value. Certain loans and unfunded\ncommitments are accounted for under the\nfair value option. Credit risk for\ncategories of assets carried at fair\nvalue is not accounted for as part of\nthe allowance for credit losses but as\npart of the fair value adjustments\nrecorded in earnings. For derivative\npositions, our credit risk is measured\nas the net cost in the event the\ncounterparties with contracts in which\nwe are in a gain position fail to\nperform under the terms of those\ncontracts. We use the current fair value\nto represent credit exposure without\ngiving consideration to future mark-to-\nmarket changes. The credit risk amounts\ntake into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting\nagreements and cash collateral. Our\nconsumer and commercial credit extension\nand review procedures encompass funded\nand unfunded credit exposures. For more\ninformation on derivatives and credit\nextension commitments, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives and Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements .\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower or counterparty,\nrepayment sources, the nature of\nunderlying collateral and other support\ngiven current events, conditions and\nexpectations. We classify our portfolios\nas either consumer or commercial and\nmonitor credit risk in each as discussed\nbelow.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit\nrisk management practices as well as\ncredit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses\nand enhance customer support in our\nconsumer businesses, we have in place\ncollection programs and loan\nmodification and customer assistance\ninfrastructures. We utilize a number of\nactions to mitigate losses in the\ncommercial businesses including\nincreasing the frequency and intensity\nof portfolio monitoring, hedging\nactivity and our practice of\ntransferring management of deteriorating\ncommercial exposures to independent\nspecial asset officers as credits enter\ncriticized categories.\n\nFor information on our credit risk\nmanagement activities, see the\nfollowing: Consumer Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management on page 59, Commercial\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management on page\n63, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 69,\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 72\nand Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases and Allowance for Credit Losses\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.

Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus, and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions as well\nas portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable, and home\nprices increased steadily throughout\nmost of 2024. Net charge-offs increased\n$1.1 billion to $4.2 billion in 2024\nprimarily due to higher credit card loan\ncharge-offs.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses was $8.6 billion,\nrelatively unchanged from 2023.

Residential\nmortgage loans that have entered the\namortization period generally experience\na higher rate of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a whole. At December 31,\n2024, $65 million, or two percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $1.0\nbillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe\n\nentire residential mortgage portfolio.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2024, $209\nmillion, or six percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere nonperforming, of which $56 million\nwere contractually current. Loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three years to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2026 or\nlater.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. In the\nNew York area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (MSA) made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both December\n31, 2024 and 2023.

Outstanding balances in the home\nequity portfolio increased $210 million\nin 2024 primarily due to draws on\nexisting lines and new\n\noriginations outpacing paydowns.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at\nDecember 31, 2024, $246 million, or 60\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $83 million, or\n20 percent, were 180 days or more past\ndue and had been written down to the\nestimated fair value of the collateral,\nless costs to sell. Accruing loans that\nwere 30 days or more past d ue remained\nrelatively unchanged in 2024 compared to\n2023.\n\nOf the $25.7 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nDecember 31, 2024, as shown in Table 23,\nnine percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that had reached the end of their\ndraw period and entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.4 billion at December 31,\n2024. The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At December 31,\n\n2024, $30 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2024, $244 million, or\nseven percent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod.

portfolio begins with an\nassessment of the credit risk profile of\nthe borrower or counterparty based on an\nanalysis of its financial position. As\npart of the overall credit risk\nassessment, our commercial credit\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and\nare subject to approval based on defined\ncredit approval standards. Subsequent to\nloan origination, risk ratings are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis, and if\nnecessary, adjusted to reflect changes\nin the financial condition, cash flow,\nrisk profile or outlook of a borrower or\ncounterparty. In making credit\ndecisions, we consider risk rating,\ncollateral, country, industry and\nsingle-name concentration limits while\nalso balancing these considerations with\nthe total borrower or counterparty\nrelationship. We use a variety of tools\nto continuously monitor the ability of a\nborrower or counterparty to perform\nunder its obligations. We use risk\nrating aggregations to measure and\nevaluate concentrations within\nportfolios. In addition, risk ratings\nare a factor in determining the level of\nallocated capital and the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation\ninitiatives, we attempt to work with\nclients experiencing financial\ndifficulty to modify their loans to\nterms that better align with their\ncurrent ability to pay. For more\ninformation on our accounting policies\nregarding delinquencies, nonperforming\nstatus and net charge-offs for the\ncommercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                                  \n   Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations                            \n                                                                                  \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 32, 34 and 37 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For more information\non our industry concentrations, see\nTable 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations on page 67.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate\nloans and loan commitments, including\nissued but unfunded letters of credit\nwhich are considered utilized for credit\nrisk management purposes, that exceed\nour single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair\nvalue option. Lending commitments, both\nfunded and unfunded, are actively\nmanaged and monitored, and as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith our credit view and market\nperspectives determining the size and\ntiming of the hedging activity. In\naddition, we purchase credit protection\nto cover the funded portion as well as\nthe unfunded portion of certain other\ncredit exposures. To lessen the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection\nlevels, credit exposure may be added\nwithin an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. These credit derivatives do\nnot meet the requirements for treatment\nas accounting hedges. They are carried\nat fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and\nother countries. As a member, we may be\nrequired to pay a pro-rata share of the\nlosses incurred by some of these\norganizations as a result of another\nmember default and under other loss\nscenarios.

For information on net\nnotional credit protection purchased to\nhedge funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option,\nas well as certain other credit\nexposures, see Commercial Portfolio\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Risk\nMitigation.\n\nCommercial credit exposure is\ndiversified across a broad range of\nindustries. Total commercial committed\nexposure increased $72.5 billion during\n2024 to $1.3 trillion. The increase in\ncommercial committed exposure was\nconcentrated in Asset managers and\nfunds, Finance companies and Individuals\nand trusts.\n\nIndustry limits are used internally to\nmanage industry concentrations and are\nbased on committed exposure that is\ndetermined on an industry-by-industry\nbasis. A risk management framework is in\nplace to set and approve industry limits\nas well as to provide ongoing\nmonitoring.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $193.9 billion, increased\n$24.6 billion, or 15 percent, during\n2024, which was primarily driven by\ninvestment-grade exposures.\n\nFinance companies, our second largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $101.8 billion, increased\n$12.7 billion, or 14 percent, during\n2024. The increase in committed exposure\nwas primarily driven by increases in\nConsumer finance, Thrifts and mortgage\nfinance and Diversified financials.\n\nCapital goods, our third largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $98.8 billion, increased\n$1.7 billion, or two percent, during\n2024. The increase in committed exposure\nwas driven by increases in Trading\ncompanies and distributors, Machinery,\nand Construction and engineering,\npartially offset by a decrease in\nIndustrial conglomerates.\n\nVarious macroeconomic challenges,\nincluding geopolitical tensions, higher\ncosts associated with inflationary\npressures experienced over the past\nseveral years and elevated interest\nrates, have led to uncertainty in the\nU.S. and global economies and have\nadversely impacted, and may continue to\nadversely impact, a number of\nindustries. We continue to monitor all\nindustries, particularly higher risk\nindustries that are experiencing or\ncould experience a more significant\nimpact to their financial condition.\n

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit\nprotection to cover the funded portion\nas well as the unfunded portion of\ncertain credit exposures. To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. At December 31, 2024 and\n2023, net notional credit default\nprotection purchased in our credit\nderivatives portfolio to hedge our\nfunded and unfunded exposures for which\nwe elected the fair value option, as\nwell as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $10.4 billion and $10.9 billion. We\nrecorded net losses of $87 million in\n2024 compared to net losses $185 million\nin 2023. The gains and losses on these\ninstruments were largely offset by gains\nand losses on the related exposures. The\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) results for these\nexposures are included in the fair value\noption portfolio information in Table\n41.

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and\nany names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default\nprotection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit\nexposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients\nand establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value\nchanges. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market\nwith large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to\na lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are\nexecuted in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject\nto credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the\nterms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk,\nwe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative\nassets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit\nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events\nsuch as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of\ncredit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral\nrequired by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional\nprotective measures such as early termination of all\n\ntrades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk\nvaluation adjustments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are\nsubject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from\nunfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in\nplace to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to\nthe direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. Table 37\npresents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2024. These\nexposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both December\n31, 2024 and 2023. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $21.5\nbillion in 2024 primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom and Canada.\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes\nsovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments\nissued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan\nequivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds,\nincluding letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the\nundrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan\nequivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives,\nincluding the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and\nsecured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at\nfair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with\nthe same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure\nrepresents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased,\nnet of credit default protection sold.\n

                                       \nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results. For more information, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 78.\n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit\nproducts are non-trading positions and\nare generally reported at amortized cost\nfor assets or the amount owed for\nliabilities (historical cost). However,\nthese positions are still subject to\nchanges in economic value based on\nvarying market conditions, with one of\nthe primary risks being changes in the\nlevels of interest rates. The risk of\nadverse changes in the economic value of\nour non-trading positions arising from\nchanges in interest rates is managed\nthrough our ALM activities. We have\nelected to account for certain assets\nand liabilities under the fair value\noption.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at\nfair value with changes reflected in\nincome. Trading positions are subject to\nvarious changes in market-based risk\nfactors. The majority of this risk is\ngenerated by our activities in the\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, credit,\nequity and commodities markets. In\naddition, the values of assets and\nliabilities could change due to market\nliquidity, correlations across markets\nand expectations of market volatility.\nWe seek to manage these risk exposures\nby using a variety of techniques that\nencompass a broad range of financial\ninstruments. The key risk management\ntechniques are discussed in more detail\nin the Trading Risk Management section.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior\nmanagement with a clear and\ncomprehensive understanding of the\ntrading risks to which we are exposed.\nThese responsibilities include ownership\nof market risk policy, developing and\nmaintaining quantitative risk models,\ncalculating aggregated risk measures,\nestablishing and monitoring position\nlimits consistent with risk appetite,\nconducting daily reviews and analysis of\ntrading inventory, approving material\nrisk exposures and fulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. Market risks that impact\nbusinesses outside of Global Markets are\nmonitored and governed by their\nrespective governance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse\nconsequences from decisions based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and\nreports. Given that models are used\nacross the Corporation, model risk\nimpacts all risk types including credit,\nmarket and operational risks. The\nEnterprise Model Risk Policy defines\nmodel risk standards, consistent with\nour Risk Framework and risk appetite,\nprevailing regulatory guidance and\nindustry best practice. All models,\nincluding risk management, valuation and\nregulatory capital models, must meet\ncertain validation criteria, including\neffective challenge of the conceptual\nsoundness of the model, independent\nmodel testing and ongoing monitoring\nthrough outcomes analysis and\nbenchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk\nCommittee, a subcommittee of the MRC,\noversees that model standards are\nconsistent with model risk requirements\nand monitors the effective challenge in\nthe model validation process across the\nCorporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Interest Rate Risk                                                              \n                                                                                  \nInterest rate risk represents exposures\nto instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest\nrates. These instruments include, but\nare not limited to, loans, debt\nsecurities, certain trading-related\nassets and liabilities, deposits,\nborrowings and derivatives. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate these risks\ninclude derivatives such as options,\nfutures, forwards and swaps.\n                                                                                  \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                                                           \n                                                                                  \nForeign exchange risk represents\nexposures to changes in the values of\ncurrent holdings and future cash flows\ndenominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar. The types of instruments\nexposed to this risk include investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign\ncurrency-denominated loans and\nsecurities, future cash flows in foreign\ncurrencies arising from foreign exchange\ntransactions, foreign currency-\ndenominated debt and various foreign\nexchange derivatives whose values\nfluctuate with changes in the level or\nvolatility of currency exchange rates or\nnon-U.S. interest rates. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk\ninclude foreign exchange options,\ncurrency swaps, futures, forwards, and\nforeign currency-denominated debt and\ndeposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Mortgage Risk                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nMortgage risk represents exposures to\nchanges in the values of mortgage-\nrelated instruments. The values of these\ninstruments are sensitive to prepayment\nrates, mortgage rates, agency debt\nratings, default, market liquidity,\ngovernment participation and interest\nrate volatility. Our exposure to these\ninstruments takes several forms. For\nexample, we trade and engage in market-\nmaking activities in a variety of\nmortgage securities including whole\nloans, pass-through certificates,\ncommercial mortgages and collateralized\nmortgage obligations including\ncollateralized debt obligations using\nmortgages as underlying collateral. In\naddition, we originate a variety of MBS,\nwhich involves the accumulation of\nmortgage-related loans in anticipation\nof eventual securitization, and we may\nhold positions in mortgage securities\nand residential mortgage loans as part\nof the ALM portfolio. We also record\nMSRs as part of our mortgage origination\nactivities. Hedging instruments used to\nmitigate this risk include derivatives\nsuch as options, swaps, futures and\nforwards as well as securities including\nMBS and U.S. Treasury securities.

Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk\ninclude bonds, CDS and other credit\nfixed-income instruments.\n                                                                                  \n   Market Liquidity Risk                                                          \n                                                                                  \nMarket liquidity risk represents the\nrisk that the level of expected market\nactivity changes dramatically and, in\ncertain cases, may even cease. This\nexposes us to the risk that we will not\nbe able to transact business and execute\ntrades in an orderly manner which may\nimpact our results. This impact could be\nfurther exacerbated if expected hedging\nor pricing correlations are compromised\nby disproportionate demand or lack of\ndemand for certain instruments. We\nutilize various risk mitigating\ntechniques as discussed in more detail\nin Trading Risk Management.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. Various\ntechniques and procedures are utilized\nto enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks.\nQuantitative measures of market risk are\nevaluated on a daily basis from a single\nposition to the portfolio of the\nCorporation. These measures include\nsensitivities of positions to various\nmarket risk factors, such as the\npotential impact on revenue from a one\nbasis point change in interest rates,\nand statistical measures utilizing both\nactual and hypothetical market moves,\nsuch as VaR and stress testing. Periods\nof extreme market stress influence the\nreliability of these techniques to\nvarying degrees. Qualitative evaluations\nof market risk utilize the suite of\nquantitative risk measures while\nunderstanding each of their respective\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers\nindependently evaluate the risk of the\nportfolios under the current market\nenvironment and potential future\nenvironments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to\nmeasure market risk as it allows the\naggregation of market risk factors,\nincluding the effects of portfolio\ndiversification. A VaR model simulates\nthe value of a portfolio under a range\nof scenarios in order to generate a\ndistribution of potential gains and\nlosses. VaR represents the loss a\nportfolio is not expected to exceed more\nthan a certain number of times per\nperiod, based on a specified holding\nperiod, confidence level and window of\nhistorical data. We use one VaR model\nconsistently across the trading\nportfolios and it uses a historical\nsimulation approach based on a three-\nyear window of historical data. Our\nprimary VaR statistic is equivalent to a\n99 percent confidence level, which means\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding\nperiod, there should not be losses in\nexcess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100\ntrading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are\nsignificant and numerous assumptions\nthat will differ from company to\ncompany. The accuracy of a VaR model\ndepends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk\nfactors in the portfolio. A VaR model\nmay require additional modeling\nassumptions for new products that do not\nhave the necessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid positions for\nwhich accurate daily prices\n\nare not consistently available. For\npositions with insufficient historical\ndata for the VaR calculation, the\nprocess for establishing an appropriate\nproxy is based on fundamental and\nstatistical analysis of the new product\nor less liquid position. This analysis\nidentifies reasonable alternatives that\nreplicate both the expected volatility\nand correlation to other market risk\nfactors that the missing data would be\nexpected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized\nrevenue volatility as changes in market\nconditions or in the composition of the\nportfolio can have a material impact on\nthe results. In particular, the\nhistorical data used for the VaR\ncalculation might indicate higher or\nlower levels of portfolio\ndiversification than will be\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model\nto reflect current market conditions, we\nupdate the historical data underlying\nour VaR model on a weekly basis, or more\nfrequently during periods of market\nstress, and regularly review the\nassumptions underlying the model. A\nminor portion of risks related to our\ntrading positions is not included in\nVaR. These risks are reviewed as part of\nour ICAAP. For more information\nregarding ICAAP, see Capital Management\non page 48.\n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates and\nenhances our VaR model so that it\nreflects the material risks in our\ntrading portfolio. Changes to the VaR\nmodel are reviewed and approved prior to\nimplementation and any material changes\nare reported to management through the\nappropriate management committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk\nmeasures, including VaR, are\nindependently set by Global Markets Risk\nManagement and reviewed on a regular\nbasis so that trading limits remain\nrelevant and within our overall risk\nappetite for market risks. Trading\nlimits are reviewed in the context of\nmarket liquidity, volatility and\nstrategic business priorities. Trading\nlimits are set at both a granular level\nto allow for extensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to\naccount for correlations among risk\nfactors. All trading limits are approved\nat least annually. Approved trading\nlimits are stored and tracked in a\ncentralized limits management system.\nTrading limit excesses are communicated\nto management for review. Certain\nquantitative market risk measures and\ncorresponding limits have been\nidentified as critical in the\nCorporation\u2019s Risk Appetite Statement.\nThese risk appetite limits are reported\non a daily basis and are approved at\nleast annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global\nMarkets senior leadership communicates\ndaily to discuss losses, key risk\npositions and any limit excesses. As a\nresult of this process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 41 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. Covered\npositions are defined by regulatory\nstandards as trading assets and\nliabilities, both on- and off-balance\nsheet, that meet a defined set of\nspecifications. These specifications\nidentify the most liquid trading\npositions which are intended to be held\nfor a short-term horizon and where we\nare able to hedge the material risk\nelements in a two-way market. Positions\nin less liquid markets, or where there\nare restrictions on the ability to trade\nthe positions, typically do not qualify\nas covered positions. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, except for\nstructural foreign currency positions\nthat are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval.\n\nIn addition, Table 41 presents our fair\nvalue option portfolio, which includes\nsubstantially all of the funded and\nunfunded exposures for which we elect\nthe fair value option, and their\n                                                                                  \n  75Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncorresponding hedges. Additionally,\nmarket risk VaR for trading activities,\nas presented in Table 41, differs from\nVaR used for regulatory capital\ncalculations due to the holding period\nused. The holding period for VaR used\nfor regulatory capital calculations is\n10 days, while for the market risk VaR\npresented below, it is one day. Both\nmeasures utilize the same process and\nmethodology.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 41 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges.

methodology is\nevaluated by backtesting, which compares\nthe daily VaR results, utilizing a one-\nday holding period, against a comparable\nsubset of trading revenue. A backtesting\nexcess occurs when a trading loss\nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding\nday. These excesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and market\nmoves that produced the trading loss\nwith a goal to help confirm that the VaR\nmethodology accurately represents those\nlosses. We expect the frequency of\ntrading losses in excess of VaR to be in\nline with the confidence level of the\nVaR statistic being tested. For example,\nwith a 99 percent confidence level, we\nexpect one trading loss in excess of VaR\nevery 100 days or between two to three\ntrading losses in excess of VaR over the\ncourse of a year. The number of\nbacktesting excesses observed can differ\nfrom the statistically expected number\nof excesses if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially\ndifferent than the level of market\nvolatility that existed during the three\nyears of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting\nis defined by regulatory agencies in\norder to most closely align with the VaR\ncomponent of the regulatory capital\ncalculation. This revenue differs from\ntotal trading-related revenue in that it\nexcludes revenue from trading activities\nthat either do not generate market risk\nor for which the market risk cannot be\nincluded in VaR. Some examples of the\ntypes of revenue excluded for\nbacktesting are fees, commissions,\nreserves, net interest income and intra-\nday trading revenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR\nresults used for regulatory capital\ncalculations as well as at the level of\nkey legal entities. These results are\nreported to senior management, who\nregularly review and evaluate the\nresults of these tests.\n\nDuring 2024, there was one day where\nthis subset of trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our total covered\nportfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day\nholding period.\n                                                                                  \n  Total Trading-related Revenue                                                   \n                                                                                  \nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding\nbrokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding\nvaluation adjustment gains (losses),\nrepresents the total amount earned from\ntrading positions, including market-\nbased net interest income, which are\ntaken in a diverse range of financial\ninstruments and markets. For more\ninformation on fair value, see Note 20 \u2013\nFair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile\nand is largely driven by general market\nconditions and customer demand. Also,\ntrading-related revenue is dependent on\nthe volume and type of transactions, the\nlevel of risk assumed, and the\nvolatility of price and rate movements\nat any given time within the ever-\nchanging market environment. Significant\ndaily revenue by business is monitored\nand the primary drivers of these are\nreviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a graphic\ndepiction of trading volatility and\nillustrates the daily level of trading-\nrelated revenue for 2024 and 2023.\nDuring 2024, positive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for more than 99\npercent of the trading days, of which 94\npercent were daily trading gains of over\n$25 million, and the largest loss was\n$12 million. This compares to 2023 where\npositive trading-related revenue was\nrecorded for 100 percent of the trading\ndays, of which 93 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25 million.\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing Because\nthe very nature of a VaR model suggests\nresults can exceed our estimates and it\nis dependent on a limited historical\nwindow, we also stress test our\nportfolio using scenario analysis. This\nanalysis estimates the change in the\nvalue of our trading portfolio that may\nresult from abnormal market movements. A\nset of scenarios, categorized as either\nhistorical or hypothetical, are computed\ndaily for the overall trading portfolio\nand individual businesses. These\nscenarios include shocks to underlying\nmarket risk factors that may be well\nbeyond the shocks found in the\nhistorical data used to calculate VaR.\nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact\nof the market moves that occurred during\na period of extended historical market\nstress. Generally, a multi-week period\nrepresenting the most severe point\nduring a crisis is selected for each\nhistorical scenario. Hypothetical\nscenarios provide estimated portfolio\nimpacts from potential future market\nstress events. Scenarios are reviewed\nand updated in response to changing\npositions and new economic or political\ninformation. In addition, new or ad hoc\nscenarios are developed to address\nspecific potential market events or\nparticular vulnerabilities in the\nportfolio. The stress tests are reviewed\non a regular basis and the results are\npresented to senior management. Stress\ntesting for the trading portfolio is\nintegrated with enterprise-wide stress\ntesting and incorporated into the limits\nframework. The macroeconomic scenarios\nused for enterprise-wide stress testing\npurposes differ from the typical trading\nportfolio scenarios in that they have a\nlonger time horizon and the results are\nforecasted over multiple periods for use\nin consolidated capital and liquidity\nplanning.

Interest rate risk\nrepresents the most significant market\nrisk exposure to our banking book\nbalance sheet. Interest rate risk is\nmeasured as the potential change in net\ninterest income caused by movements in\nmarket interest rates. Client-facing\nactivities, primarily lending and\ndeposit-taking, create interest rate\nsensitive positions on our balance\nsheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of\nnet interest income. The baseline\nforecast takes into consideration\nexpected future business growth, ALM\npositioning and the future direction of\ninterest rate movements as implied by\nmarket-based forward curves. We then\nmeasure and evaluate the impact that\nalternative interest rate scenarios have\non the baseline forecast in order to\nassess interest rate sensitivity under\nvaried conditions. The net interest\nincome forecast is frequently updated\nfor changing assumptions and differing\noutlooks based on economic trends,\nmarket conditions and business\nstrategies. Thus, we continually monitor\nour banking book balance sheet position\nin order to maintain an acceptable level\nof exposure to interest rate changes.\nThe interest rate scenarios that we\nanalyze incorporate balance sheet\nassumptions such as loan and deposit\ngrowth and pricing, changes in funding\nmix, product repricing, maturity\ncharacteristics and investment\nsecurities premium amortization. Our\noverall goal is to manage interest rate\nrisk so that movements in interest rates\ndo not significantly adversely affect\nearnings and capital.

deposit balance\nchanges that could occur under various scenarios while Static Deposits assumes no\ndeposit balance change.\nn/a=not applicable\nWe continue to be asset sensitive to a\nparallel upward move in interest rates\nwith the majority of that impact coming\nfrom the short end of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates\nnegatively impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities classified as available\nfor sale and adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from banking\nbook activities. For more information on\nBasel 3, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Capital on page 49.\n\nAs part of our ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The\nsensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes\nthat we take no action in response to\nthese rate shocks and does not assume\nany change in other macroeconomic\nvariables normally correlated with\nchanges in interest rates. Beginning in\nthe second quarter of 2024, the\nsensitivity analysis incorporates\npotential movements in customer behavior\nthat could result in changes in both\ntotal customer deposit balances and\ndeposit balance mix, (e.g., interest\nbearing versus noninterest bearing),\nunder the various interest rate\nscenarios. In higher rate scenarios, the\nanalysis assumes that a portion of low-\ncost or noninterest-bearing deposits are\nreplaced with higher yielding deposits\nor market-based funding. Conversely, in\nlower rate scenarios, the analysis\nassumes that a portion of higher\nyielding deposits or market-based\nfunding are replaced with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits.\n\nFor larger interest rate scenarios, the\ninterest rate sensitivity may behave in\na non-linear manner as there are\nnumerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing is\nrate sensitive in nature. This\nsensitivity is assumed to have non-\nlinear impacts to larger short-end rate\nmovements. In\n\ndecreasing interest rate scenarios, and\nparticularly where interest rates have\ndecreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced\nas customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit\npricing will likely increase at a faster\nrate, leading to incremental interest\nexpense and reducing asset sensitivity.\nWhile the impact related to the above\nassumptions used in the asset\nsensitivity analysis can provide\ndirectional analysis on how net interest\nincome will be impacted in changing\nenvironments, the ultimate impact is\ndependent upon the interrelationship of\nthe assumptions and factors, which vary\nin different macroeconomic scenarios.\n                                                                                  \n  Economic Value of Equity                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to interest rate sensitivity\ndescribed above, the Corporation\u2019s\nmanagement of its interest rate\nexposures in the banking book also\nconsiders a long-term view of interest\nrate sensitivity through the measurement\nof Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE\ncaptures changes in the net present\nvalue of banking book assets and\nliabilities under various interest rate\nscenarios and its impact to Tier 1\ncapital. Similar to net interest income,\nthe Corporation establishes limits for\nEVE. EVE is largely driven by the\nCorporation\u2019s longer duration fixed-rate\nproducts, such as investment securities,\nresidential mortgages and deposits. For\nassets or liabilities that have no\nstated maturity, such as deposits, the\nCorporation estimates the duration for\nmeasurement purposes.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 44.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nin accounting hedges to manage\nsubstantially all of the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations.\nBy hedging the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in\nthis area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can\nbe substantial in the mortgage business.\nChanges in interest rates and other\nmarket factors impact the volume of\nmortgage originations. Changes in\ninterest rates also impact the value of\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)\nand the related residential first\nmortgage LHFS between the date of the\nIRLC and the date the loans are sold to\nthe secondary market. An increase in\nmortgage interest rates typically leads\nto a decrease in the value of these\ninstruments. Conversely, when there is\nan increase in interest rates, the value\nof the MSRs will increase driven by\nlower prepayment expectations. Because\nthe interest rate risks of these hedged\nitems offset, we combine them into one\noverall hedged item with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio consisting of\nderivative contracts and securities.\n                                                                                  \n   Compliance and Operational Risk Management                                     \n                                                                                  \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or\nregulatory sanctions, material financial\nloss or damage to the reputation of the\nCorporation arising from the failure of\nthe Corporation to comply with the\nrequirements of applicable LRRs and our\ninternal policies and procedures\n(collectively, applicable LRRs). We are\nsubject to comprehensive and evolving\nregulation under federal and state laws,\nrules and regulations in the U.S. and\nthe laws of the various jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, including those\nrelated to financial crimes and anti-\nmoney laundering, market conduct,\ntrading activities, fair lending,\nprivacy, data protection, development\nand use of AI, and unfair, deceptive or\nabusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems, people or\nexternal events, and includes legal\nrisk. Operational risk may occur\nanywhere in the Corporation, including\nthird-party business processes, and is\nnot limited to operations functions. The\nCorporation faces a number of key\noperational risks including third-party\nrisk, model risk, conduct risk,\ntechnology risk, information security\nrisk and data risk. The pace of\ntechnological change, including in the\nfield of AI, may heighten risks in those\nareas. Operational risk can result in\nfinancial losses and reputational\nimpacts and is a component in\n\nthe calculation of total RWA used in the\nBasel 3 capital calculation. For more\ninformation on Basel 3 calculations, see\nCapital Management on page 48.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and\nforemost responsible for managing all\naspects of their businesses, including\ntheir compliance and operational risk.\nFLUs and control functions are required\nto understand their business processes\nand related risks and controls,\nincluding third-party dependencies and\nthe related regulatory requirements, and\nmonitor and report on the effectiveness\nof the control environment. In order to\nactively monitor and assess the\nperformance of their processes and\ncontrols, they must conduct\ncomprehensive quality assurance\nactivities and identify issues and risks\nto remediate control gaps and\nweaknesses. FLUs and control functions\nmust also adhere to compliance and\noperational risk appetite limits to meet\nstrategic, capital and financial\nplanning objectives. Finally, FLUs and\ncontrol functions are responsible for\nthe proactive identification, management\nand escalation of compliance and\noperational risks across the\nCorporation. Collectively, these efforts\nare important to strengthen their\ncompliance and operational resiliency,\nwhich is the ability to deliver critical\noperations through disruption. To\naddress AI-related risks, we have\nimplemented internal processes and\ngovernance frameworks. These measures\nhelp with regulatory compliance and\nresponsible use of AI across our\noperations.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk\nteams independently assess compliance\nand operational risk, monitor business\nactivities and processes and evaluate\nFLUs and control functions for adherence\nto applicable LRRs, including\nidentifying issues and risks, and\nreporting on the state of the control\nenvironment. Corporate Audit provides an\nindependent assessment and validation\nthrough testing of key compliance and\noperational risk processes and controls\nacross the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance \u2013\nEnterprise Policy and Operational Risk\nManagement \u2013 Enterprise Policy set the\nrequirements for reporting compliance\nand operational risk information to\nexecutive management as well as the\nBoard or appropriate Board-level\ncommittees and reflect Global Compliance\nand Operational Risk\u2019s responsibilities\nfor conducting independent oversight of\nthe Corporation\u2019s compliance and\noperational risk management activities.\nThe Board provides oversight of\ncompliance risk through its Audit\nCommittee and the ERC, and operational\nrisk through its ERC.\n                                                                                  \n  Cybersecurity                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management and Strategy                                                   \n                                                                                  \nCybersecurity is a key operational risk\nfacing the Corporation. We, our\nemployees, customers, regulators and\nthird parties are ongoing targets of an\nincreasing number of cybersecurity\nthreats and cyberattacks and,\naccordingly, the Corporation devotes\nconsiderable resources to the\nestablishment and maintenance of\nprocesses for assessing, identifying and\nmanaging cybersecurity risk through its\nglobal workforce and 24/7 cyber\noperations centers around the world. The\nCorporation takes a cross-functional\napproach to addressing cybersecurity\nrisk, with our Global Technology, Global\nRisk Management, Legal and Corporate\nAudit functions playing key roles. In\naddition, the Corporation\u2019s processes\nrelated to cybersecurity risk are an\nelement of and integrated with the\nCorporation\u2019s comprehensive risk\nprogram, including our risk\nframework.For more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s Cybersecurity risk, see\nItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Business\nOperations beginning on page 14. For\nmore\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America80                                                               \n                                                                                  \ninformation on our approach to risk\nmanagement, including our risk\nmanagement governance framework, see\nManaging Risk on page 45. As part of the\nCorporation\u2019s overall risk management\nprogram, the Corporation\u2019s Global\nInformation Security (GIS) Program is\nsupported by three lines of defense. As\nthe first line of defense, the GIS team\nis responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the GIS Program, which\nincludes defining policies and\nprocedures designed to safeguard the\nCorporation\u2019s information systems and\nthe information those systems collect,\nprocess, maintain, use, share,\ndisseminate and dispose of. As the\nsecond line of defense, Global\nCompliance and Operational Risk\nindependently assesses, monitors and\ntests cybersecurity risk across the\nCorporation, as well as the\neffectiveness of the GIS Program. As the\nthird line of defense, Corporate Audit\nconducts additional independent review\nand validation of the first-line and\nsecond-line processes and functions. The\nCorporation seeks to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and associated legal,\nfinancial, reputational, operational\nand/or regulatory risks by employing a\nmulti-faceted GIS Program, through\nvarious policies and procedures, that\nare focused on governing, preparing for,\nidentifying, preventing, detecting,\nmitigating, responding to and recovering\nfrom cybersecurity threats and incidents\nsuffered by the Corporation and its\nthird-party service providers, as well\nas effectively operating the\nCorporation\u2019s processes. Our business\ncontinuity policies and procedures are\ndesigned to maintain the availability of\nbusiness functions and enable impacted\nunits within the Corporation and its\nthird-party service providers to achieve\nstrategic objectives in the event of a\ncybersecurity incident. In accordance\nwith the Corporation\u2019s cyber incident\nresponse framework, GIS, including its\nincident response team, tracks,\ndocuments, responds to and analyzes\ncybersecurity threats and cybersecurity\nincidents, including those experienced\nby the Corporation\u2019s third-party service\nproviders that may impact the\nCorporation. Additionally, the\nCorporation has a process for assembling\nmulti-stakeholder executive response\nteams to monitor and coordinate cross-\nfunctional responses to certain\ncybersecurity incidents. As part of the\nGIS Program, the Corporation leverages\nboth internal and external assessments\nand industry partnerships. The\nCorporation engages third-party\nassessors, consultants, auditors and\nother third-party professionals to\nevaluate and test its cybersecurity\nprogram and provide guidance on\noperating and improving the GIS Program,\nincluding the design and operational\neffectiveness of the security and\nresiliency of our information systems.\nThe Corporation focuses on and has\nprocesses to oversee cybersecurity risk\nassociated with its third-party service\nproviders. As part of its cybersecurity\nrisk management processes, the\nCorporation maintains an enterprise-wide\nprogram that defines standards for the\nplanning, sourcing, management, and\noversight of third-party relationships\nand third-party access to its\ninformation system, facilities, and/or\nconfidential or proprietary data. The\nCorporation has established security\nrequirements applicable to third-party\nservice providers, and where permitted\nby contract, cybersecurity diligence is\nconducted to assess the alignment of\nthird-party service providers\u2019\ncybersecurity programs with the\nCorporation\u2019s cybersecurity\nrequirements. While we and our third\nparties have experienced cybersecurity\nincidents, as well as adverse impacts\nfrom such incidents, we have not\nexperienced material losses or other\nmaterial consequences relating to\ncybersecurity incidents experienced by\nus or our third parties. However, we\nexpect to\n\ncontinue to experience cybersecurity\nincidents resulting in adverse impacts\nwith increased frequency and severity\ndue to the evolving threat environment\nincluding the increasing use of AI, such\nas generative AI and machine learning,\nfor cybersecurity threat and cyberattack\npurposes, and there can be no assurance\nthat future cybersecurity incidents,\nincluding incidents experienced by our\nthird parties, will not have a material\nadverse impact on the Corporation,\nincluding its business strategy, results\nof operations and/or financial\ncondition.\n                                                                                  \n  Governance                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThrough established governance\nstructures, the Corporation has policies\nand procedures to help facilitate\noversight of cybersecurity risk. In\naccordance with these policies and\nprocedures, the Corporation\u2019s three\nlines of defense, and management, strive\nto prepare for, identify, prevent,\ndetect, mitigate, respond to and recover\nfrom cybersecurity threats and\nincidents, monitor performance, and\nescalate to executive management, the\ncommittees of the Corporation\u2019s Board\nand/or to the Board, as appropriate.\nAdditionally, GIS reports cybersecurity\nincidents that meet certain criteria to\nthe Legal Department for evaluation of\nmateriality and potential escalation and\ndisclosure, which includes the\nconsideration of relevant quantitative\nand qualitative factors. The Board is\nactively engaged in the oversight of the\nGIS Program and devotes time and\nattention to the oversight and\nmitigation of cybersecurity risk. The\nBoard, which includes members with\ntechnology and cybersecurity experience,\noversees management\u2019s approach to\nstaffing and the policies and procedures\nto address cybersecurity risk. The Board\nand its ERC, which is responsible for\nreviewing cybersecurity risk, each\nreceive regular presentations, memoranda\nand reports from our Chief Technology\nand Information Officer (CTIO) and our\nChief Information Security Officer\n(CISO)on internal and external\ncybersecurity developments, threats and\nrisks. The Boardreceives prompt and\ntimely information from management on\ncybersecurity incidents, including\ncybersecurity incidents experienced by\nthe Corporation\u2019s third-party service\nproviders, that may pose significant\nrisk to the Corporation, and continues\nto receive regular reports on any such\nincidents until their conclusion.\nAdditionally, the Board receives\nquarterly reports on the performance\nmetrics for the GIS Program and the\nperformance of the Corporation\u2019s\ncybersecurity risk appetite metrics,\nincluding metrics on vulnerabilities and\nthird-party cybersecurity risks and\nincidents, and is notified promptly if a\nBoard-level cybersecurity risk limit is\nbreached. Our ERC also annually reviews\nand approves our GIS Program and our\nInformation Security Policy, which\nestablish administrative, technical, and\nphysical safeguards designed to protect\nthe security, confidentiality,\navailability and integrity of customer\nrecords and information in accordance\nwith the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the\ninteragency guidelines issued\nthereunder, and applicable laws\nglobally. Under the Board\u2019s oversight,\nmanagement works closely with key\nstakeholders, including regulators,\ngovernment agencies, law enforcement,\npeer institutions and industry groups,\nand develops and invests in talent and\ninnovative technology in order to better\nmanage cybersecurity risk. Our most\nsenior cybersecurity employees are the\nCTIO and CISO, who are primarily\nresponsible for managing and assessing\ncybersecurity risk. The CISO oversees a\nteam of more than 3,400 information\nsecurity professionals spanning the\nglobe. The CISO and the GIS senior\nleadership team have deep cybersecurity\nexpertise, with over 200 years of\ncollective\n                                                                                  \n  81Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nexperience working in the cybersecurity\nfield, at the Corporation, in\ngovernment, and other companies in\nvarious industries. Additionally,\ncertain members of the GIS leadership\nteam hold leadership roles in sector-\nspecific information and infrastructure\nsecurity organizations, including the\nFinancial Services Information Sharing\nand Analysis Center and the Financial\nServices Sector Coordinating Council.\nEmployees across the Corporation also\nplay a role in protecting the\nCorporation from cybersecurity threats\nand receive periodic training and\neducation on cybersecurity-related\ntopics.\n                                                                                  \n   Reputational Risk Management                                                   \n                                                                                  \nReputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations. Reputational risk may result\nfrom many of the Corporation\u2019s\nactivities, including those related to\nthe management of strategic,\noperational, compliance, liquidity,\nmarket (price and interest rate) and\ncredit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational\nrisk through established policies and\ncontrols embedded throughout its\nbusiness and risk management processes.\nWe proactively monitor and identify\npotential reputational risk events and\nhave processes established to mitigate\nreputational risks in a timely manner.\nIf reputational risk events occur, we\nfocus on remediating the underlying\nissue and taking action to minimize\ndamage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Corporation has processes in place\nto respond to events that give rise to\nreputational risk, including educating,\nusing policy influencers and\nimplementing communication strategies,\nas applicable, to mitigate the impact.\nThe Corporation\u2019s organization and\ngovernance structure provides oversight\nof reputational risks through management\nand Board or Board committees.

Additionally,\nreputational risk reporting is provided\nto senior management and the Board\nregularly.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate risk is divided into two major\ncategories, both of which span the seven\nkey risk types discussed in Managing\nRisk on page 45: (1) Physical Risk:\nrisks related to the physical impacts of\nclimate change, driven by extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes and\nfloods, as well as chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2)\nTransition Risk: risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor third parties. Transition risks of\nclimate change may amplify credit risks\nthrough the financial impacts of changes\nin policy, technology or the market on\nthe Corporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the ERC and the\nCorporate Governance, ESG and\nSustainability Committee (CGESC) of the\nBoard, which regularly discuss climate-\nrelated topics. The ERC oversees climate\nrisk as set\n\nforth in our Risk Framework and Risk\nAppetite Statement. The CGESC is\nresponsible for overseeing the\nCorporation\u2019s environmental and\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s climate-related policies\nand practices.\n\nOur Climate Risk Council consists of\nleaders across risk, FLU and control\nfunctions, and meets routinely to\ndiscuss our approach to managing\nclimate-related risks. Our climate risk\nmanagement efforts are overseen by an\nofficer who reports to the CRO. The\nCorporation has a Climate and\nEnvironmental Risk Management function\nthat is responsible for overseeing\nclimate risk management. They are\nresponsible for establishing the Climate\nRisk Framework (described below) and\ngovernance structure, and providing an\nindependent assessment of enterprise-\nwide climate risks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, we created our internal\nClimate Risk Framework, which addresses\nvarious global climate-related laws,\nrules, regulations and guidance. The\nframework describes how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes,\nincludes examples of how climate risk\nmanifests across the seven risk types,\nand details the roles and\nresponsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense (i.e., FLUs, Global Risk\nManagement and Corporate Audit).\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see Managing Risk on page 45.\nFor more information on climate risk,\nsee Item 1A.

We have procedures and\nprocesses in place to facilitate making\nthese judgments.\n\nThe more judgmental estimates are\nsummarized in the following discussion.\nWe have identified and described the\ndevelopment of the variables most\nimportant in the estimation processes\nthat involve mathematical models to\nderive the estimates. In many cases,\nthere are numerous alternative judgments\nthat could be used in the process of\ndetermining the inputs to the models.\nWhere alternatives exist, we have used\nthe factors that we believe represent\nthe most reasonable value in developing\nthe inputs. Actual performance that\ndiffers from our estimates of the key\nvariables could materially impact our\nresults of operations. Separate from the\npossible future impact to our results of\noperations from input and model\nvariables, the value of our lending\nportfolio and market-sensitive assets\nand liabilities may change subsequent to\nthe balance sheet date, often\nsignificantly, due to the nature and\nmagnitude of future credit and market\nconditions. Such credit and market\nconditions may change quickly and in\nunforeseen ways and the resulting\nvolatility could have a significant,\nnegative effect on future operating\nresults. These fluctuations would not be\nindicative of deficiencies in our models\nor inputs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses includes the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nthe reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Our process for determining\nthe allowance for credit losses is\ndiscussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The\ndetermination of the allowance for\ncredit losses is based on numerous\nestimates and assumptions, which require\na high degree of judgment and are often\ninterrelated. A critical judgment in the\nprocess is the weighting of our forward-\nlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are\nincorporated into our quantitative\nmodels. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation\nuses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in\nits expected credit losses (ECL)\ncalculation, which have included a\nbaseline scenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario\nreflecting a moderate recession, a\ndownside scenario reflecting continued\ninflation and interest rates above the\nbaseline scenario, a tail risk scenario\nsimilar to the severely adverse scenario\nused in stress testing and an upside\nscenario that considers the potential\nfor improvement above the baseline\nscenario. The overall economic outlook\nis weighted to reflect a moderate growth\nenvironment, with lower gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth and higher\nunemployment rate expectations as\ncompared to what we experienced in 2024.\nGenerally, as the consensus estimates\nimprove or deteriorate, the allowance\nfor credit losses will change in a\nsimilar direction. There are multiple\nvariables that drive the macroeconomic\nscenarios with the key variables\nincluding, but not limited to, U.S. real\nGDP and unemployment rates. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the latest consensus\nestimate for the U.S. average\nunemployment rate for the fourth quarter\nof 2024 was 4.2 percent, and U.S. real\nGDP was forecasted to grow 2.4 percent\nyear-over-year in the fourth quarter of\n2024, reflecting a strong labor market\nand steady growth compared to our\nmacroeconomic outlook as of December 31,\n2023, and were factored into our\nallowance for credit losses estimate as\nof December 31, 2024. In addition, the\ntable below presents the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for U.S. average\nunemployment rate and U.S. real GDP.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 45           Key Allowance                                                \n                     Variables                                                    \n                                                 Quarterly                        \n                                                   Average                        \n                                              4Q Year 1(1)       4Q Year 2(1)     \n  U.S.                                                                            \n  Unemployment                                                                    \n  December 31,                                         4.9  %             4.9  %  \n  2023 forecast                                                                   \n  December 31,                                         4.8                4.7     \n  2024 forecast                                                                   \n                                            Year-Over-Year                        \n                                              4Q Year 1(1)       4Q Year 2(1)     \n  U.S. Real GDP                                                                   \n  Growth                                                                          \n  December 31,                                         0.3  %             1.4  %  \n  2023 forecast                                                                   \n  December 31,                                         1.4                1.8     \n  2024 forecast                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n(1) Represents the forecasted weighted economic outlook one and two years out from\nthe reporting date. In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the\nallowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset\nquality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal\nrisk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower\ndelinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or\ndecreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real\nestate portfolio, all\n\nof which have some degree of uncertainty. The allowance for credit losses\ndecreased $215 million from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2023 to $14.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024, primarily due to a reserve release in our commercial portfolio\ndue to a favorable macroeconomic environment and reduced exposure in our\ncommercial real estate portfolio. To provide an illustration of the sensitivity of\nthe macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance\nfor credit losses, the Corporation compared the December 31, 2024 modeled ECL from\nthe baseline scenario to our adverse scenario. Relative to the baseline scenario,\nthe adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate of over two percentage\npoints higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U.S. real GDP followed by a\nprolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of\napproximately 19 percent at the trough. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a\nhypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4.8\nbillion. While the sensitivity analysis may be useful to consider how changes in\ncertain macroeconomic assumptions could impact our baseline ECLs, it should not be\nrelied upon as a forecast of how our allowance for credit losses is expected to\nchange in a different macroeconomic outlook. Ultimately, the estimate of the\nallowance for credit losses is dependent upon a variety of potential factors\nincluding, but not limited to, qualitative assessments, weighting of alternate\nmacroeconomic scenarios and changes in portfolio mix that would need to be\nconsidered comprehensively in determining the allowance for credit losses. Due to\nthe uncertainty in predicting these factors, they are not incorporated into the\nsensitivity analysis. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under applicable\naccounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair\nvalue measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy in the accounting standards. The fair values of assets and\nliabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality,\nwhere appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are\nsensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is\navailable, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our\nvaluation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are\nsupported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility,\nlessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market\npricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with\nthe prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the\nfair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and\ncontrols that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval\nof quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value\ndetermination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that\nrequires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and\nsubstantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products.\nPrimarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service\ninputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled\nvalues and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by\nour understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with\na higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and\nlesser reliance applied to those developed through their own\n                                                                                  \n  83Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ninternal modeling. For example, broker\nquotes in less active markets may only\nbe indicative and therefore less\nreliable. These processes and controls\nare performed independently of the\nbusiness. For more information, see Note\n20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements and Note 21\n\u2013 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Level 3 Assets and\nLiabilities Financial assets and\nliabilities, and MSRs, where values are\nbased on valuation techniques that\nrequire inputs that are both\nunobservable and are significant to the\noverall fair value measurement are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair\nvalue hierarchy established in\napplicable accounting standards. The\nfair value of these Level 3 financial\nassets and liabilities and MSRs is\ndetermined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation. Level 3 financial\ninstruments may be hedged with\nderivatives classified as Level 1 or 2;\ntherefore, gains or losses associated\nwith Level 3 financial instruments may\nbe offset by gains or losses associated\nwith financial instruments classified in\nother levels of the fair value\nhierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses\nrecorded in earnings did not have a\nsignificant impact on our liquidity or\ncapital. We conduct a review of our fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications on a\nquarterly basis. Transfers into or out\nof Level 3 are made if the significant\ninputs used in financial models\nmeasuring the fair values of the assets\nand liabilities became unobservable or\nobservable, respectively, in the current\nmarketplace, or when previously\ninsignificant unobservable and\nobservable inputs become significant,\nrespectively.

Accrued Income\nTaxes and Deferred Tax Assets Accrued\nincome taxes, reported as a component of\neither other assets or accrued expenses\nand other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent\nthe net amount of current income taxes\nwe expect to pay to or receive from\nvarious taxing jurisdictions\nattributable to our operations to date.\nWe currently file income tax returns in\nmore than 100 jurisdictions and consider\nmany factors, including statutory,\njudicial and regulatory guidance, in\nestimating the appropriate accrued\nincome taxes for each jurisdiction. Net\ndeferred tax assets, reported as a\ncomponent of other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent\nthe net decrease in taxes expected to be\npaid in the future because of net\noperating loss (NOL) and tax credit\ncarryforwards and because of future\nreversals of temporary differences in\nthe\n\nbases of assets and liabilities as\nmeasured by tax laws and their bases as\nreported in the financial statements.\nNOL and tax credit carryforwards result\nin reductions to future tax liabilities,\nand many of these attributes can expire\nif not utilized within certain periods.\nWe consider the need for valuation\nallowances to reduce net deferred tax\nassets to the amounts that we estimate\nare more likely than not to be realized.\nConsistent with the applicable\naccounting guidance, we monitor relevant\ntax authorities and change our estimates\nof accrued income taxes and/or net\ndeferred tax assets due to changes in\nincome tax laws and their interpretation\nby the courts and regulatory\nauthorities. These revisions of our\nestimates, which also may result from\nour income tax planning and from the\nresolution of income tax audit matters,\nmay be material to our operating results\nfor any given period.

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of\nthe Corporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2024 based on the framework set forth by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\nin Internal Control \u2013 Integrated\nFramework (2013) . Based on that\nassessment, management concluded that,\nas of December 31, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2024 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP , an\nindependent registered public accounting\nfirm, as stated in their accompanying\nreport which expresses an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness of the\nCorporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2024.\n                                                                                  \n  Brian T.

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and on the Corporation's\ninternal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect\nto the Corporation in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an\n\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such\nother procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n                                                                                  \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and\nthat (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses -\nCommercial and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,\nexcluding loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\nvalue option. As of December 31, 2024,\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nwas $13.2 billion on total loans and\nleases of $1,091.6 billion, which\nexcludes loans accounted for under the\nfair value option. For commercial and\nconsumer card loans, the expected credit\nloss is typically estimated using\nquantitative methods that consider a\nvariety of factors such as historical\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nloss experience, the current credit\nquality of the portfolio as well as an\neconomic outlook over the life of the\nloan. In its loss forecasting framework,\nthe Corporation incorporates forward\nlooking information through the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the\nforecasted life of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include\nvariables that have historically been\nkey drivers of increases and decreases\nin credit losses. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices,\ngross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen and the weighting given\nto each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic\nevents, leading economic indicators,\nviews of internal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends. Also\nincluded in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses are qualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are expected but, in\nthe Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions.\nFactors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal\nand regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation\nconsiders the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built on\nhistorical data.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and\nlease losses for the commercial and\nconsumer card portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndeveloping lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios and related weightings to each\nscenario, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and\nin evaluating audit evidence obtained,\nand (ii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding controls over the evaluation\nand approval of models, forecast\nscenarios and related weightings, and\nqualitative reserves. These procedures\nalso included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the\nallowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the loss forecast\nmodels and methodology, (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of certain\nmacroeconomic variables, (iii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s development, selection and\nweighting of lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios used in the loss forecast\nmodels, (iv) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the\nestimate, and (v) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves made to the model output\nresults to determine the overall\nallowance for loan and lease losses. The\nprocedures also included the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in evaluating\nthe appropriateness of certain loss\nforecast models, the reasonableness of\neconomic forecast scenarios\n\nand related weightings and the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves.\n\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial\nInstruments\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCorporation carries certain financial\ninstruments at fair value, which\nincludes $10.0 billion of assets and\n$6.3 billion of liabilities classified\nas Level 3 fair value measurements that\nare valued on a recurring basis and $3.1\nbillion of assets classified as Level 3\nfair value measurements that are valued\non a nonrecurring basis, for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation. The Corporation determines\nthe fair value of Level 3 financial\ninstruments using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. Unobservable inputs, such\nas volatility or implied yield, may be\ndetermined using quantitative-based\nextrapolations, pricing models or other\ninternal methodologies which incorporate\nmanagement estimates and available\nmarket information.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the valuation of certain\nLevel 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment and estimation used\nby management to determine the fair\nvalue of these financial instruments,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and\neffort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained,\nincluding the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe valuation of financial instruments,\nincluding controls related to valuation\nmodels, significant unobservable inputs,\nand data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a\nsample of these certain financial\ninstruments and comparison of\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair\nvalue. Developing the independent\nestimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data\nprovided by management and evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Corporation\u2019s\nauditor since 1958.\n

financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout\nthe U.S. and in certain international markets. The term \u201cthe Corporation\u201d as used\nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and\nits majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where\nthe Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions\nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included\nfrom the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation\nbecame the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are\nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts\nfor investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include\nthe Corporation\u2019s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject\nto impairment testing, and the Corporation\u2019s proportionate share of income or loss\nis included in other income. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially\ndiffer from those estimates and assumptions. New Accounting Standard Adopted\nSegment Reporting The Financial Accounting Standards Board amended the segment\nreporting requirements to add disclosures of incremental segment expense\ncategories. The Corporation adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2024 on a\nretrospective basis.The additional disclosures are included in Note 23 \u2013 Business\nSegment Information . Significant Accounting Principles Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of\ncollection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and\namounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain\nnon-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or\nusage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\nSecurities Financing Agreements Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements\nto resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities\nfinancing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except\nin instances where the transaction\n\nis required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions.\nGenerally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued\ninterest. In instances where the interest is negative, the Corporation\u2019s policy is\nto present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative\ninterest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities financing\nagreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the\nfair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making\nand similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation\u2019s\npolicy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale\nagreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to\ncounterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create\nmaterial credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, any allowance\nfor loan losses is insignificant. In transactions where the Corporation acts as\nthe lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be\npledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability,\nrepresenting the obligation to return those securities. Trading Instruments\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value.\nFair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar\nassets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are\nestimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may\nrequire significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses\nare recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are\nrecognized in market making and similar activities. Derivatives and Hedging\nActivities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to\nsupport risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities\ninclude derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are\nnot designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other\nrisk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign\ncurrency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives.\nDerivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward\nsettlement contracts, and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle\npositive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on\nquoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable\nmarket-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on\ndealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar\ntechniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America94                                                               \n                                                                                  \nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of the\ninstrument including counterparty credit risk and the Corporation\u2019s own credit\nstanding, as applicable. Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or\nderivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair\nvalue included in market making and similar activities. Derivatives used for other\nrisk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative\nliabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been\ndesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not\nqualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported\nat fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative\ninstrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will\noffset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks\nassociated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by\nthe Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk\nare included in market making and similar activities. Credit derivatives are also\nused by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit\nexposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in\nmarket making and similar activities and other income. Derivatives Used For Hedge\nAccounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation\nformally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and\nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for\nundertaking various accounting hedges. The Corporation primarily uses regression\nanalysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to\nassess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected\nto be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or\ncash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation\ndiscontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not\nexpected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge. Additionally, the\nCorporation may choose to discontinue a hedge relationship at any time. Fair value\nhedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s\nassets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange\nvolatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value\nhedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line\nitem with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative\ninstrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed,\nthe previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability\nare subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the\ncarrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the\nremaining life of the respective asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are used\nprimarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or\nforecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk\nassociated with deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\nused in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the\nhedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings.\nComponents of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are\nrecorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item. Net investment\nhedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net\ninvestment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that\nare designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are\nexcluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and\nsimilar activities. Securities Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the\npurpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased for use\nin the Corporation\u2019s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar\nactivities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the\nCorporation\u2019s asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or\nas held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value\nare either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses\nnet-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized\ngains and losses reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt\nsecurities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold\nto maturity and are reported at amortized cost. If more than 85percent of the\nprincipal has been collected on level-payment mortgage-backed HTM debt securities\nsince their acquisition, the debt securities, if disposed, are treated as matured\nfor classification purposes. The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the\nvalue has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or\nbelieves it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt\nsecurity, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt\nsecurities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt\nsecurities for ECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S.\nTreasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality\nwhere the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS\ndebt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal\nand external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt\nsecurity fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis\nis used by the Corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a\nresult of an ECL. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense\nor a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to\nadjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected\ncredit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all\nrelevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds,\nthe financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the\nunderlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market\nfactors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the\ncredit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in\n                                                                                  \n  95Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nwhich case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the\namortized cost and the fair value of the asset. The Corporation separately\nevaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially\nall qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the\nCorporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses\nwhich are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. Interest on\ndebt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is\nincluded in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to\ninterest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Realized gains and losses from the sales or dispositions of debt\nsecurities are determined using the specific identification method. Equity\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading\npurposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in\nother income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values\nare recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable\nprice changes. These securities are reported in other assets. Loans and Leases\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are\nreported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income,\ncharge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for\npurchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination\nfees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as\nadjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned\nincome, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a constant\neffective yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain\nconsumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported\nin interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar\nactivities or other income. Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting\npurposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and,\nwithin each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable. A portfolio\nsegment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class\nof financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio\nsegments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and\nmethods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2019s threeportfolio segments are Consumer\nReal Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within\nthe Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home\nequity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nare credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within\nthe Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial,\ncommercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business\ncommercial. Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers\nthrough a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type\nleases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the\nestimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is\naccreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate\nthe interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease\ncomponents. Allowance for Credit Losses The ECL on funded consumer and commercial\nloans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is\nreported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity\nlines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded\nloan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses\nand other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and\nlease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit\nlosses to the current estimate of ECL. For loans and leases, the ECL is typically\nestimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as\nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as\nan economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-\nended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any\nexpected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that\nare at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open- ended products (e.g., lines\nof credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated\nwith future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation\ndoes not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic\nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases\nand decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal\nand third-party economists and industry trends. The estimate of credit losses\nincludes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative\nallowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan\nare not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash\nflows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the\ncharge-off. Included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative\nreserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors\nsuch as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further,\nthe Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are\nbuilt on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit card\nportfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America96                                                               \n                                                                                  \nin the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally\nclassifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90days past due and reverses\ninterest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the\ninterest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was\noriginally recorded. The Corporation has identified the following threeportfolio\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\nConsumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential\nreal estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over\nthe life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments,\nusing quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most\nsignificant in estimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are\nfurther broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current,\ndelinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\nCorporation\u2019s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect\nthe economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real\nestate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss\nestimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and\nlong-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records\na reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn\nportion of the Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation\nif certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending\ncommitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and\nincorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For loans that are more\nthan 180days past due, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell.\nThe fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined\nusing an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by\nreference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends\nspecific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued\nis located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation\nutilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations,\nthe Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair\nvalue of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations,\nthe Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the\naggregate. For loans that are more than 180days past due, with the exception of\nthe Corporation\u2019s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that\nis in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is\ncharged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to\nthe initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;\nhowever, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a\nlevel above the cumulative charge-off amount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount\nand timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,\nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable\nbalance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending\nbehavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the\neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in\naccordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act\nof 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then\nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it\nis brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook,\nborrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all\nkey inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on\nthe credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally\ncancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined\nusing quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The\nquantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan\ncharacteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,\nunderlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The ECL on commercial\nloans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan\u2019s\ncontractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms\nto forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected\nprepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes\nin funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw and payment\nbehavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with\ncommercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of\nrepayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes\nsuch as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures\nvariations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the\nunemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are\nutilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which\nimpact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss\nforecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit\nrisk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the\nborrower\u2019s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and\nthe geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of\ncollateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower\u2019s\nindustry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected\nloss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic\nvariables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond\nspreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns. In addition\nto the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL\nrelated to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial\nguarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for\nthe unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded\nexposure\n                                                                                  \n  97Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments. Nonperforming Loans\nand Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans and leases generally\ninclude loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans\naccounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as\nnonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off\nagainst the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later\nrecovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the\nrecovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If\nrecoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net charge-offs are\nreported as a negative amount. In accordance with the Corporation\u2019s policies,\nconsumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home\nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming at 90days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the\nFHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae\n(FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage\nloans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and,\ntherefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are\nplaced on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying\nfirst-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past due even if the junior-lien loan is\ncurrent. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of\nthe estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the\nend of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan is\nfully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of\nnotification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan\nbecomes 180days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest\nuntil they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming\nloans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become\n90days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or\ndeath or upon confirmation of fraud, unless the borrower\u2019s performance indicates\nthat repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become\n120days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60days after receipt\nof notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud, and when the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral\nis not expected, the loans are fully charged off. Commercial loans and leases,\nexcluding business card loans, that are past due 90days or more as to principal or\ninterest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including\nloans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on\nnonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as\nconsumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally\ncharged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be\nuncollectible. The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease\nis contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the\nspecified due date on the customer\u2019s billing statement. Interest and fees continue\nto accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when\nloans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on\nnonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is\nuncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are\ncredited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual\nstatus when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the\nremaining contractual principal and interest is expected. Loans Held-for-sale\nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including\nresidential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real\nestate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain\nLHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan\norigination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are\ncapitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a\nloan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that\nare on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the\npolicy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\nPremises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated\nlives range up to 40years for buildings, up to 12years for furniture and\nequipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold\nimprovements. Other Assets For the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and\nleases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets\nfor ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral\nmaintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily\nmargining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be\nmaintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be\nzero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses,\nincluding consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to\nestimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded\nas a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. Lessee\nArrangements Substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s lessee arrangements are\noperating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are\nreported in other assetson the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease\nliabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are\nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less\nthan 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America98                                                               \n                                                                                  \nlease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to\nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease\nfor its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments represent\npayments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease\npayments and discounted using the Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-\nof-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments\nmade prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair\nvalue of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for\npotential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate\na potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a\nbusiness segment or one level below a business segment. The Corporation assesses\nthe fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including\ngoodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment\ntesting, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying\nvalue of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised\nof allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its goodwill impairment\ntesting, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic\nconditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the\nrespective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific\nconsiderations. If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative\nassessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the\nqualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly\nto performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may\nresume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When\nperforming the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered\nimpaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a\ngoodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting\nunit\u2019s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized\ncannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment\nloss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill\nimpairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance. For\nintangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the\ncarrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nThe carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of\nthe asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not\nsubject to amortization and are assessed for impairment when events or\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair\nvalue. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors\nor whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the\nentity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it\nhas both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\nimpact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the\nright to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a\nquarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and\nevaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests\nin the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is\ninvolved may change as a result of such reassessments. The Corporation primarily\nuses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers\nwhole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation\nis the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-\nagency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans,\nthe Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the\ntrust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain\ncircumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued\nsecurities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to\ndirect the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization\ntrust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific\nsubordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation\nconsolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the\nmost significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has\nother contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and\nwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation\nmay also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal\nbond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or\nresecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust\nsuch as the remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing\nactivities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the\nidentification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities\nto be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments\nthat could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not\nconsolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number\nof third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have\ncontrol over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other\nsubstantive rights.\n                                                                                  \n  99Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs),\ninvestment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles.\nThe Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and,\ntherefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an\nevent of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities\nissued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation\nconsolidates the CDO. The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment\nvehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the\nassets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses\nthrough an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements.\nThe Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor\ncontrolled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles\nor if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be\nsignificant to the vehicle. Retained interests in securitized assets are initially\nrecorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities\nissued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are\nclassified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM\nsecurities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive\nmarkets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not\navailable; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present\nvalue of the associated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The Corporation\nmeasures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in\naccordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on\nexit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair\nvalue. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are\ncategorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation\ntechnique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation\ncategorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this\nthree-level hierarchy. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and\nequity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange\nmarket, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are\nactively traded in OTC markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1\nprices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the\nassets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with\nquoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and\nderivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with\ninputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S.\ngovernment and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS),\ncorporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that\nare significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3\nassets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination\nof fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair\nvalue for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate\nthe assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThis category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations,\nconsumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative\ncontracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent\npricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying\nassets. Income Taxes There are two components of income tax expense: current and\ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax\nassets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and\nliabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the\nfuture because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets\nand liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the\nfinancial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes\nsuch as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation\nallowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management\nconcludes are more likely than not to be realized. Income tax benefits are\nrecognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be\nmore likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order\nto be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount\nof that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The\ndifference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax\nreturn is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records\nincome tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax\nexpense. Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue\nrecognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities. Card\nIncome Card income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as\ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit\ncard transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income\nis presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement\nof the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on\na percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the\ncorresponding payment network\u2019s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized\nat the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees,\nwhich are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants\nthat are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America100                                                              \n                                                                                  \nand credit card partner payments.\nRewards paid to cardholders are related\nto points earned by the cardholder that\ncan be redeemed for a broad range of\nrewards including cash, travel and gift\ncards. The points to be redeemed are\nestimated based on past redemption\nbehavior, card product type, account\ntransaction activity and other\nhistorical card performance. The\nliability is reduced as the points are\nredeemed. The Corporation also makes\npayments to credit card partners. The\npayments are based on revenue-sharing\nagreements that are generally driven by\ncardholder transactions and partner\nsales volumes. As part of the revenue-\nsharing agreements, the credit card\npartner provides the Corporation\nexclusive rights to market to the credit\ncard partner\u2019s members or customers on\nbehalf of the Corporation. Service\nCharges Service charges include deposit\nand lending-related fees. Deposit-\nrelated fees consist of fees earned on\nconsumer and commercial deposit\nactivities and are generally recognized\nwhen the transactions occur or as the\nservice is performed. Consumer fees are\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various\ntransaction-based services, such as ATM\ntransactions, wire transfer activities,\ncheck and money order processing and\ninsufficient funds/overdraft\ntransactions. Commercial deposit-related\nfees are from the Corporation\u2019s Global\nTransaction Services business and\nconsist of commercial deposit and\ntreasury management services, including\naccount maintenance and other services,\nsuch as payroll, sweep account and other\ncash management services. Lending-\nrelated fees generally represent\ntransactional fees earned from certain\nloan commitments, financial guarantees\nand SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage\nServices Investment and brokerage\nservices consist of asset management and\nbrokerage fees. Asset management fees\nare earned from the management of client\nassets under advisory agreements or the\nfull discretion of the Corporation\u2019s\nfinancial advisors (collectively\nreferred to as assets under management\n(AUM)). Asset management fees are earned\nas a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and\ngenerally range from 50basis points\n(bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In cases\nwhere a third party is used to obtain a\nclient\u2019s investment allocation, the fee\nremitted to the third party is recorded\nnet and is not reflected in the\ntransaction price, as the Corporation is\nan agent for those services. Brokerage\nfees include income earned from\ntransaction-based services that are\nperformed as part of investment\nmanagement services and are based on a\nfixed price per unit or as a percentage\nof the total transaction amount.\nBrokerage fees also include distribution\nfees and sales commissions that are\nprimarily in the Global Wealth &\nInvestment Management (GWIM) segment and\nare earned over time. In addition,\nprimarily in the Global Markets segment,\nbrokerage fees are earned when the\nCorporation fills customer orders to buy\nor sell various financial products or\nwhen it acknowledges, affirms, settles\nand clears transactions and/or submits\ntrade information to the appropriate\nclearing broker. Certain customers pay\nbrokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees\nimposed by relevant regulatory bodies or\nexchanges in order to execute or clear\ntrades. These fees are recorded net and\nare not reflected in the transaction\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent\nfor those services. Investment Banking\nIncome Investment banking income\nincludes underwriting income and\nfinancial advisory services income.\nUnderwriting consists of fees earned for\nthe placement of a customer\u2019s debt or\nequity\n\nsecurities. The revenue is generally\nearned based on a percentage of the\nfixed number of shares or principal\nplaced. Once the number of shares or\nnotes is determined and the service is\ncompleted, the underwriting fees are\nrecognized. The Corporation incurs\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses, such as\nlegal costs, in performing these\nservices. These expenses are recovered\nthrough the revenue the Corporation\nearns from the customer and are included\nin operating expenses. Syndication fees\nrepresent fees earned as the agent or\nlead lender responsible for structuring,\narranging and administering a loan\nsyndication. Financial advisory services\nconsist of fees earned for assisting\nclients with transactions related to\nmergers and acquisitions and financial\nrestructurings. Revenue varies depending\non the size of the transaction and scope\nof services performed and is generally\ncontingent on successful completion of\nthe transaction. Revenue is typically\nrecognized once the transaction is\ncompleted and all services have been\nrendered. Additionally, the Corporation\nmay earn a fixed fee in merger and\nacquisition transactions to provide a\nfairness opinion, with the fees\nrecognized when the opinion is delivered\nto the client. Other Revenue Measurement\nand Recognition Policies The Corporation\ndid not disclose the value of any open\nperformance obligations at December 31,\n2024, as its contracts with customers\ngenerally have a fixed term that is less\nthan one year, an open term with a\ncancellation period that is less than\none year, or provisions that allow the\nCorporation to recognize revenue at the\namount it has the right to invoice.\nEarnings Per Common Share Earnings per\ncommon share (EPS) is computed by\ndividing net income allocated to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding, excluding\nunvested common shares subject to\nrepurchase or cancellation. Net income\nallocated to common shareholders is net\nincome adjusted for preferred stock\ndividends including dividends declared,\naccretion of discounts on preferred\nstock including accelerated accretion\nwhen preferred stock is repaid early,\nand cumulative dividends related to the\ncurrent dividend period that have not\nbeen declared as of period end, less\nincome allocated to participating\nsecurities. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing income allocated to common\nshareholders plus dividends on dilutive\nconvertible preferred stock and\npreferred stock that can be tendered to\nexercise warrants, by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding plus\namounts representing the dilutive effect\nof stock options outstanding, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units (RSUs),\noutstanding warrants and the dilution\nresulting from the conversion of\nconvertible preferred stock, if\napplicable. Foreign Currency Translation\nAssets, liabilities and operations of\nforeign branches and subsidiaries are\nrecorded based on the functional\ncurrency of each entity. When the\nfunctional currency of a foreign\noperation is the local currency, the\nassets, liabilities and operations are\ntranslated, for consolidation purposes,\nfrom the local currency to the U.S.\ndollar reporting currency at period-end\nrates for assets and liabilities and\ngenerally at average rates for results\nof operations. The resulting unrealized\ngains and losses are reported as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI, net-of-\ntax. When the foreign entity\u2019s\nfunctional currency is the U.S. dollar,\nthe resulting remeasurement gains or\nlosses on foreign currency-denominated\nassets or liabilities are included in\nearnings.\n                                                                                  \n  101Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar\nagreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative counterparties.\nWhere legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation\noffsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nfollowing table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023 by\nprimary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on\nwhich these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis,\nprior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross\nderivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which\ninclude reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received\nor paid.

Interest rate, foreign\nexchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's\nALM and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest\nrate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate\ncontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis\nswaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in\nearnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage\ninterest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest\nrate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or\ndepreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are\nlinked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to\nsubstantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk,\nincluding interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market\nrisk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or\nrevenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking\nproduction income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and\nother derivative instruments, including purchased options and certain debt\nsecurities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate\noptions, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures\nto hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will\nincrease or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest\nrates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit\nrisk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives\ninclude credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives Designated as\nAccounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its\nassets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange\nrates (fair value hedges).

Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The following table summarizes\ncertain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for\n2024, 2023 and 2022. Of the $ 5.6billion after-tax net loss ($ 7.5billion pretax)\non derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2024, losses of $ 2.5billion\nafter-tax ($ 3.4billion pretax) related to both open and closed cash flow hedges\nare expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net\nlosses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest\nincome related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the\nmaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately five years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over\nwhich the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is\napproximately four years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being\ninsignificant. On November 15, 2023, Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced\nthe permanent cessation of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) and\nall its tenors effective after final publication on November 15, 2024. The\nCorporation determined that certain forecasted BSBY-indexed interest payments,\nwhich had been designated in cash flow hedges, were no longer expected to occur\nbeyond November 15, 2024 as they would transition to a new reference rate.\nAccordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $\n2.0billion of pretax loss from accumulated OCI into market making and

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 3.9billion and $ 4.1billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure\nto the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 3.9billion and $\n4.2billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of\nthe transferred securities was $ 3.6billion and $ 4.1billion. Sales and Trading\nRevenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and\nliabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to\n\ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include\nderivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these\nderivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global\nMarkets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within\nGlobal Markets is recorded in various income statement line items, including\nmarket making and similar activities and net interest income as well as other\nrevenue categories. Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value\nand realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net\ninterest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue\nis generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price\nat which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity\nsecurities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the \u201cOther\u201d\ncolumn in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these\nsecurities are included in market making and similar activities. For debt\nsecurities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt\nsecurities, is typically included in market making and similar activities. Unlike\ncommissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the\ninstrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore,\nthis revenue is recorded in market making and similar activities as part of the\ninitial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included\nin market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation\nacts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are\nrecorded in other income. The following table, which includes both derivatives and\nnon-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income\nstatement line items attributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue\nin Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for 2024, 2023 and 2022.

(2) Includes\ncommodity risk.\n\nCredit Derivatives The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to\nfacilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit\nderivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation\nor a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as\nthe seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence\nof a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of\nthe referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as\nacceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit\nderivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the\nCorporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss\nhas occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.\nCredit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on\nthe credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation\nconsiders ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade\nincludes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses\ninternal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent\nwith how risk is managed for these instruments. Credit derivative instruments\nwhere the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the following table.\n

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading\nsecurities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to\nthe entities under the terms of the securities owned. Credit-related Contingent\nFeatures and Collateral The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative\ncontracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions,\nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of nonfinancial\ncompanies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a\ndaily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending\non the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically\nrequire an increase in the amount of collateral\n                                                                                  \n  109Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nrequired of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to\ntake additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.\nFurther, as previously discussed on page 158, the Corporation enters into legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and\nnetting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain\nevents. Certain of the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-\nrelated contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting\nagreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of\nthese instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty\nwith whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes\nin the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the\nderivative transactions. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation held cash\nand securities collateral of $ 105.9billion and $ 104.1billion and posted cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 83.1billion and $ 93.4billion in the normal course of\nbusiness under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements\nwhere clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and\nsecured financing arrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in\nthe event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nAt December 31, 2024, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of\nthe contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to\npost to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $ 2.7billion,\nincluding $ 1.4billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA). Some\ncounterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or\nthe Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such\nas find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2024 and\n2023, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.\nThe following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have\nbeen contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements\nat December 31, 2024 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior\ndebt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch\nand by an additional second incremental notch.

The Corporation\ncalculates valuation adjustments on\nderivatives based on a modeled expected\nexposure that incorporates current\nmarket risk factors. The exposure also\ntakes into consideration credit\nmitigants such as enforceable master\nnetting agreements and collateral. CDS\nspread data is used to estimate the\ndefault probabilities and severities\nthat are applied to the exposures. Where\nno observable credit default data is\navailable for counterparties, the\nCorporation uses proxies and other\nmarket data to estimate default\nprobabilities and severity.\nThe table below presents credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA\ngains (losses) on derivatives (excluding\nthe effect of any related hedge\nactivities), which are recorded in\nmarket making and similar activities,\nfor 2024, 2023 and 2022. CVA gains\nreduce the cumulative CVA thereby\nincreasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the\ncumulative DVA thereby decreasing the\nderivative liabilities balance. CVA and\nDVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA\ngains related to derivative assets\nreduce the cumulative FVA thereby\nincreasing the derivative assets\nbalance. FVA gains related to derivative\nliabilities increase the cumulative FVA\nthereby decreasing the derivative\nliabilities balance. FVA losses have the\nopposite impact.\n                                                                                  \n  Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\nWithin the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality\nindicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score.\nRefreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value\nof the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan\nand available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against\nthe property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan,\nrefreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower\nbased on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit\nhistory. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain\nborrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy\nproceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary\ncredit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nand the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal\nclassifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit\nquality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial\nloans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special\nMention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by\nregulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a\nhigh probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not\nconsidered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality\nindicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types\nof loans. The following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross\ncharge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other\nConsumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for\nrevolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are\nshown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2024.\n

Consumer Real Estate The\nfollowing modification programs are offered for consumer real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties, in addition to borrowers affected\nby natural disasters. Forbearance and Other Payment Plans: Forbearance plans\ngenerally consist of the Corporation suspending the borrower\u2019s payments for a\ndefined period, with those payments then due over a defined period of time or at\nthe conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan is generally\nfrozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. If a borrower is unable to fulfill\ntheir obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial offer\nor permanent modification.\n\nTrial Offer and Permanent Modifications : Trial offer for modification plans\ngenerally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that\nreduce their contractual payments temporarily over a three-to- four-monthtrial\nperiod. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial\nperiod and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become\npermanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a trial\nperiod. In a permanent modification, the borrower\u2019s payment terms are typically\nmodified in more than one manner, but generally include a term extension and an\ninterest rate reduction. At times, the permanent modification may also include\nprincipal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts\nto the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the\nterms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual\nobligations. The term extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity\npermanent modifications vary widely and can be up to 30years, but most are in the\nrange of 1to 20years. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were\ninsignificant during 2024 and 2023.

The carrying value of consumer real estate loans,\nincluding fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $ 464million and $ 633million. During\n2024 and 2023, the Corporation reclassified $ 89million and $ 106million of\nconsumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired\nupon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured\nloans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing\nactivities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. Credit Card and Other Consumer Credit card and other consumer loans\nare primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a\nsignificantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6months to\n72months, most of which had a 60-monthterm at December 31, 2024. In certain\ncircumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance\nif the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes\nmodifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal\nprograms) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide\nsolutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The\nDecember 31, 2024 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were\nmodified through these programs during 2024 was $ 650million compared to $\n598million in 2023. These modifications represented 0.31percent of outstanding\ncredit card and other consumer loans for 2024 compared to 0.29percent for 2023.\nDuring 2024, the financial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average\ninterest rate reduction of 18.89percent compared to 19.02percent in 2023, and\nprincipal forgiveness of $ 113million compared to $ 61million in 2023. The\nCorporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of\nmodification programs. During 2024 and 2023, defaults of credit card and other\nconsumer loans that had been modified within 12 months were insignificant. At\nDecember 31, 2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $ 650million, of\nwhich $ 546million were current, $ 58million were 30-89 days past due, and $\n46million were greater than 90 days past due. At December 31, 2023, modified\ncredit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty totaled $ 598million, of which $ 491million were current, $ 59million\nwere 30-89 days past due, and $ 48million were greater than 90 days past due.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while\nproviding borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties,\noften to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects\nthe borrower\u2019s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are\nprimarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve\nthe Corporation forbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or\npayment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in\ninterest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial\nborrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short\nsales or other settlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan.\nThe following table provides the ending amortized cost of commercial loans\nmodified during 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America122                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  Lo\u2026                                                                             \n  -                                                                               \n  Mo\u2026                                                                             \n  to                                                                              \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  in                                                                              \n  Fi\u2026    Ye\u2026                                                                      \n  Di\u2026    En\u2026                                                             As a     \n  (D\u2026    De\u2026                                   In\u2026                       % of     \n  in     31,       Term                        Ra\u2026                       Fin\u2026     \n  mi\u2026    20\u2026       Ext\u2026          For\u2026          Re\u2026          Tot\u2026         Rec\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026           $        1,\u2026  $        262  $         \u2014  $        1,\u2026    0.39  %  \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  No\u2026                     27             \u2014            \u2014            27    0.02     \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  re\u2026                    1,\u2026           444          100           2,\u2026    3.64     \n  es\u2026                                                                             \n  To\u2026           $        3,\u2026  $        706  $       100  $        3,\u2026    0.67     \n         Ye\u2026                                                                      \n         En\u2026                                                                      \n         De\u2026                                                                      \n         31,                                                                      \n         20\u2026                                                                      \n  U.\u2026           $        1,\u2026  $         30  $         \u2014  $        1,\u2026    0.29  %  \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  No\u2026                    136             \u2014           24           160    0.13     \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  re\u2026                    1,\u2026           416            \u2014           2,\u2026    2.84     \n  es\u2026                                                                             \n  To\u2026           $        2,\u2026  $        446  $        24  $        3,\u2026    0.59     \n                                                                                  \nTerm extensions granted increased the weighted-average life of the impacted loans\nby 1.7years during 2024 compared to 1.6years in 2023. The weighted-average\nduration of loan payments deferred under the Corporation\u2019s commercial loan\nforbearance program was 9months during 2024 and 2023. The deferral period for loan\npayments can vary, but are mostly in the range of 8months to 24months.\nModifications of loans to troubled borrowers for Commercial Lease Financing and\nU.S. Small Business Commercial were not significant during 2024.

Prior-period Troubled Debt Restructuring\nDisclosures Prior to adopting the new accounting standard on loan modifications,\nthe Corporation accounted for modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty as TDRs, when the modification resulted in a concession. The\nfollowing discussion reflects loans that were considered TDRs prior to January 1,\n2023. Consumer Real Estate The following table presents the December 31, 2022\nunpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification\ninterest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during\n2022. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans\nthat were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had\npreviously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.\nBinding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made\nand continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters\ninto a permanent modification. At December 31, 2022, remaining commitments to lend\nadditional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real\nestate TDR were not significant.\n                                                                                  \n  123Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Consum\u2026                                                                         \n  Real                                                                            \n  Estate                                                                          \n  \u2013 TDRs                                                                          \n  Entered                                                                         \n  into                                                                            \n  During                                                                          \n  2022                                                                            \n  (Dolla\u2026                     Unpaid                   Pre-Mod\u2026       Post-M\u2026     \n  in         December       Princip\u2026       Carrying    Interest       Intere\u2026     \n  millio\u2026    31, 2022        Balance          Value        Rate       Rate(1)     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Reside\u2026                $     1,144    $     1,015        3.52  %       3.40  %  \n  mortga\u2026                                                                         \n  Home                           238            191        4.61          4.65     \n  equity                                                                          \n  Total                  $     1,382    $     1,206        3.71          3.62     \n                                                                                  \n(1) The post-modification interest rate reflects the interest rate applicable only\nto permanently completed modifications, which exclude loans that are in a trial\nmodification period.\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2022 carrying value for consumer real\nestate loans that were modified in a TDR during 2022, by type of modification.\n                                                                               \n  Consumer Real Estate \u2013 Modification Programs       TDRs Entered into During  \n  (Dollars in millions)                                                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Modifications under government programs         $                         2  \n  Modifications under proprietary programs                              1,100  \n  Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy(1)                              14  \n  Trial modifications                                                      90  \n  Total modifications                             $                     1,206  \n                                                                               \n(1) Includes loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment\nterms that are classified as TDRs.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying value of consumer real estate loans that\nentered into payment default during 2022 that were modified in a TDR during the 12\nmonths preceding payment default.

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit\ncard and other consumer. Commercial Loans During 2022 , the carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $ 1.9billion . At\nDecember 31, 2022 , the Corporation had commitments to lend $ 358million to\ncommercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment default was $ 105million at December 31, 2022 .\n\nLoans Held-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS of $ 9.5billion and $ 6.0billion at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of\nloans originally classified as LHFS were $ 32.3billion, $ 16.3billion and $\n32.0billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash used for originations and purchases of\nLHFS totaled $ 36.2billion, $ 15.6billion and $ 24.9billion for 2024, 2023 and\n2022 . Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $ 0, $ 632million\nand $ 1.9billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022 . Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued\ninterest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale was $ 4.3billion\nand $ 4.5billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is reported in customer and\nother receivableson the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not\nclassified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month\nin which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of\nnotification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud . During 2024,\nthe Corporation reversed $ 856million of interest and fee income against the\nincome statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of\nthe principal balance of the loan compared to $ 584million in 2023. For the\noutstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and\ncommercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2024 and 2023,\ninterest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as\nnonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's\nnonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using\nquantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as\nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an\neconomic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that\nare expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not adequately be reflected\nin the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the\n\nweighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen\neach quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal\nand third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit\nlosses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The December\n31, 2024 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic\nscenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an\nadverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario\nreflecting continued inflation and interest rates with minimal rate cuts, a tail\nrisk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and\nan upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline\nscenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above scenarios has\nimproved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December 31,\n2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment\nrate will be just below fivepercent in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will remain\nnear this level through the fourth quarter of 2026. The weighted economic outlook\nassumes steady growth with U.S. real gross domestic product forecasted to grow at\n1.4percent and 1.8percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2025 and 2026.\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased $ 215million from December 31, 2023 to $\n14.3billion at December 31, 2024. The change in the allowance for credit losses\nwas comprised of a net decrease of $ 102million in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a decrease of $ 113million in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The decline in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to\ndecreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 240million and the consumer real estate\nportfolio of $ 118million, partially offset by an increase in the credit card and\nother consumer portfolios of $ 143million. The provision for credit losses\nincreased $ 1.4billion to $ 5.8billion in 2024 compared to $ 4.4billion in 2023\nand $ 2.5billion in 2022. The increase in provision for credit losses in 2024 was\nprimarily driven by credit card as well as small business loan growth, and asset\nquality deterioration in the commercial real estate office and credit card\nportfolios. The increase in provision for credit losses in 2023 was driven by the\nCorporation\u2019s consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and\nasset quality deterioration, partially offset by improved macroeconomic conditions\nthat primarily benefited the Corporation\u2019s commercial portfolio. Outstanding loans\nand leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $\n41.4billion in 2024 primarily driven by commercial, which increased $ 36.4billion\ndue to broad-based growth.

                   \nNOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles. The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities\nof consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 in\nsituations where the Corporation has a loan or security interest and involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest\nin the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 resulting from its\n\ninvolvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with\nassets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses\nassociated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity\ncommitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of\nassets. The Corporation invests in ABS, CLOs and other similar investments issued\nby third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement other than a\nloan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the Corporation also enters\ninto certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities\nsecondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances.\nThese securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013 Securities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included\nin the following tables. The Corporation did not provide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2024, 2023 and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America126                                                              \n                                                                                  \n2022 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it\nintend to do so. The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put\noptions and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $\n1.0billion and $ 989million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. First-lien Mortgage\nSecuritizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation\nsecuritizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates\nor purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC\n(collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)\nprimarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with\nor shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize\nloans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation\nmay, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases\nfrom other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes.\nFurther, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization\ntrusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by\nthe trusts. Except as described in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the\nCorporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts\nother than standard representations and warranties.

Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 33million, $\n49million and $ 41million, net of hedges, during 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n84.1billion and $ 92.7billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 231million, $ 248million and $\n274million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Servicing advances on\nserviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment,\nwere $ 1.0billion and $ 1.3billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . Home Equity Loans The\nCorporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the\nCorporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a\nrapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure\nin the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result\nof the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity\nlines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the\ntiming of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During\n2024, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage\nsecuritization trusts with total assets of $ 1.1billion, $ 685million and $\n784million.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n\n(2) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and\nother arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations, but excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and\nother servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(3) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the\ntransferor to securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which\nmay include servicing the loans.\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Credit Card and Automobile Loan\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nand automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are sold on a non-\nrecourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas\nadditional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or\nproceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on the securitization\nstructure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trusts\nincludes servicing the receivables and holding various subordinated interests,\nincluding an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit card receivables and owning\ncertain retained interests. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of\nthe receivables in the trusts totaled $ 18.1billion and $ 16.6billion, which are\nincluded in loans and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities\nthat were issued to third-party investors from the trusts totaled $ 8.0billion and\n$ 7.8billion, which are included in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The\nCorporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed\nin a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 23.9billion, $ 8.6billion,\nand $ 21.8billion of securities during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSecurities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to\nthe resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded.\nSecurities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair\nvalue of $ 3.6billion, $ 2.4billion and $ 2.4billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets. Substantially all of the trading account\nsecurities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and\ncommodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are\ntypically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit\nexposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The\nCorporation\u2019s involvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer\nVIEs totaled $ 1.1billion and $ 952million at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nincluding the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment,\nif any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation\nadministers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate\nmunicipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust\ncertificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party\ninvestors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal\nbond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $\n1.8billion and $ 1.7billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The weighted-average\nremaining\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America128                                                              \n                                                                                  \nlife of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2024 was 11.1years. There were no\nsignificant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2024, 2023 and\n2022. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities,\ntypically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple\ntranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party\nportfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs,\nholds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the\nCDOs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated\nCDOs totaled $ 65million and $ 80million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investment\nVIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in\nconnection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold\nloans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are\ndesigned to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $ 6million and $ 472 million. The Corporation\nalso held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $ 23.0billion\nand $ 18.4billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs\ntotaled $ 2.5billion and $ 2.6billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 comprised\nprimarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities. Leveraged\nLease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease\ntrusts totaled $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The\ntrusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and\ndistribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the\ntrusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents\nthe Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that\nthe leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged\nlease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The table below summarizes the\nmaximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation that related to other\nasset-backed VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n

limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these\nunconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 85.7billion and $ 84.1billion as of December\n31, 2024 and 2023. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an\ninvestor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are\nallocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and\nrelated regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which\nvaries based on the type of investments. Tax credits from investments in\naffordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax\ncredits from renewable energy investments are recognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for\ntransactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a\n10-year\n                                                                                  \n  129Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \ntime period.

The\nCorporation may be asked to invest\nadditional amounts to support a troubled\naffordable housing project. Such\nadditional investments have not been and\nare not expected to be significant.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefitsrelated to affordable\nhousing equity investments of $\n2.2billion, $ 1.9billion and $\n1.5billion, and reported pretax losses\nin other incomeof $ 1.6billion, $\n1.5billion and $ 1.2billion. The\nCorporation\u2019s equity investments in\nrenewable energy totaled $ 13.0billion\nand $ 14.2billion at December 31, 2024\nand 2023.

Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and\nRestricted Cash\n\nThe Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned\nor sold under agreements to repurchase. These financing agreements (also referred\nto as \u201cmatched-book transactions\u201d) are to accommodate customers, obtain securities\nto cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects\nto account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value\noption. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value\nOption . Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements Substantially all of the\nCorporation\u2019s securities financing activities are transacted under legally\nenforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities\nlending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of\n\ndefault by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset\nreceivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets\nsecurities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and\nthe transactions have the same maturity date. The Securities Financing Agreements\ntable presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Balances are\npresented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting.\nGross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

or in excess of the principal amount borrowed. For\nsecurities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of\ncash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value\nof the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued\ndaily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may\nreceive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and\nsecurities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e.,\nno stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to\nthese agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties,\nproviding a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when\nappropriate. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation classifies borrowings with an\noriginal maturity of less than one year as short-term borrowings on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of short-\nterm borrowings consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which totaled $\n12.7billion and $ 13.2billion, and commercial paper, which totaled $ 24.2billion\nand $ 13.1billion. Collateral The Corporation accepts securities and loans as\ncollateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of this collateral was $ 925.7billion\nand $ 911.3billion, of which $ 882.2billion and $ 870.9billion were sold or\nrepledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell. The Corporation also pledges company-owned\nsecurities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and\nloan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be\nsold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically\ndisclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain cases, the Corporation has\ntransferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as\ncollateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs. In addition, the\nCorporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts.\nRequired collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type\nof counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of\ncash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on\nprovisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash\ncollateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges\ncollateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative\nliabilities. For more information on the collateral of derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives. Restricted Cash At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation held\nrestricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 6.1billion and $ 5.6billion, predominantly related to cash\nsegregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet reserve requirements.\n                                                                                  \n  133Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 11                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term Debt                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or\nmore.

During\n2023, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $ 42.7billion consisting of $ 25.3billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $ 10.5billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 6.9billion of other\ndebt. Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S.\nand non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes\nmay be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2024 and\n2023, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars\nincluded in total long-term debt was $ 43.8billion and $ 49.8billion. Foreign\ncurrency contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated\ndebt into U.S. dollars. The weighted-average effective interest rates for total\nlong-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and\ntotal floating-rate debt were 3.80percent, 3.71percent and 4.45percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2024, and 3.70percent, 3.55percent and 5.21percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2023. The Corporation\u2019s ALM activities maintain an\noverall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of\ninterest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\nmovements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings\nand capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the\ndebt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. The following\ntable shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of\nlong-term debt as of December 31, 2024. Included in the table are certain\nstructured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the\nborrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified\ndates prior to maturity.

business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to\nmeet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the\nnotional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.\nThe distributed amounts were $ 10.4billion and $ 10.3billion at December 31, 2024\nand 2023. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s credit extension commitments at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, excluding commitments accounted for under\n\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.2billion, which predominantly\nrelated to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of\nthese commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally\nhave specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse\nchange clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 2.2billion and $ 2.6billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 that\nare accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these commitments of $ 144million and $ 67million at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, which is classified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had commitments to\nenter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of\n$ 109.8billion and $ 117.0billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 87.1billion and $ 63.0billion. A\nsignificant portion of these commitments will expire within the next 12months. At\nboth December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or\npurchase up to $ 4.0billion, on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases\nfrom a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nCorporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 787million and $\n477million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is required to\nsubscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve district\nbank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both December 31,\n2024 and 2023, the Corporation had paid $ 5.4billion for half of its subscribed\nshares, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district\nbank board, which the Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees Bank-owned\nLife Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer\nbook value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance\npolicies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nnotional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.3billion and $ 3.8billion. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these\nguarantees totaled $ 506million and $ 577million, with estimated maturity dates\nbetween 2034 and 2037. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the\nCorporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as\ntax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events\noccur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard\ncontractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on\nan assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically\ncontain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the\nagreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under\nindemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including\nthe occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in\ntax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to\nparties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard\ncontract language and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically,\nany payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has\nassessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America136                                                              \n                                                                                  \nMerchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor\nof other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that\ncannot be collected from the merchants due to, among other things, merchant fraud\nor insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be\ncollected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be\nheld liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time\nlimits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network\nrules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was\napproximately $ 197billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure as of December 31, 2024. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily\nrelates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for\nfuture delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses, and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. Exchange and Clearing\nHouse Member Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various securities and\nderivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As\na member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses\nincurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and\nunder other loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be limited\nto its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount\n(or multiple) of the Corporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in\nlimited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under\nthese membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has\nassessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage\nand Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients.\nUnder these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of\nits clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations\nin this respect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and the\naccounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their\ncustomers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements\nis difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nmaterial losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale\nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this\nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored\nmembers to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential\nfor the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration\nthe related collateral, was $ 191.9billion and $ 132.5billion at December 31, 2024\nand 2023. Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions\nsuch as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and\nother transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100percent owned\nfinance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Representations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or\nby GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-\nguaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage\nloans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies\nand certain\n                                                                                  \n  137Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nsubsidiaries sold pools of first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans and home\nequity loans as private-label\nsecuritizations or in the form of whole\nloans. In connection with these\ntransactions, the Corporation or certain\nof its subsidiaries or legacy companies\nmake and have made various\nrepresentations and warranties. Breaches\nof these representations and warranties\nhave resulted in and may continue to\nresult in the requirement to repurchase\nmortgage loans or to otherwise make\nwhole or provide indemnification or\nother remedies to sponsors, investors,\nsecuritization trusts, guarantors,\ninsurers or other parties (collectively,\nrepurchases). Unresolved Repurchase\nClaims Unresolved representations and\nwarranties repurchase claims represent\nthe notional amount of repurchase claims\nmade by counterparties, typically the\noutstanding principal balance or the\nunpaid principal balance at the time of\ndefault. In the case of first-lien\nmortgages, the claim amount is often\nsignificantly greater than the expected\nloss amount due to the benefit of\ncollateral and, in some cases, mortgage\ninsurance or mortgage guarantee\npayments. The notional amount of\nunresolved repurchase claims at December\n31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 2.1billion and $\n5.4billion. These balances included $\n837million and $ 2.2billion at December\n31, 2024 and 2023 of claims related to\nloans in specific private-label\nsecuritization groups or tranches where\nthe Corporation owns substantially all\nof the outstanding securities or will\notherwise realize the benefit of any\nrepurchase claims paid. During 2024, the\nCorporation received $ 181million in new\nrepurchase claims that were not time-\nbarred. During 2024, $ 3.5billion in\nclaims were resolved. Reserve and\nRelated Provision The reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees was\n$ 184million and $ 604million at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 and is\nincluded in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, and the related provision is\nincluded in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. At\nDecember 31, 2024, the estimated range\nof possible loss in excess of the\naccrued representations and warranties\nreserve was not significant. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity.\n\nOther Contingencies In 2023, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\nissued a final rule to impose a special\nassessment to recover certain estimated\nlosses to the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(DIF) arising from the closures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nThe estimated losses will be recovered\nthrough quarterly special assessments\ncollected from certain insured\ndepository institutions, including the\nCorporation, and collection began during\nthe three months ended June 30, 2024. As\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nCorporation\u2019s accrual for its estimated\nshare of the FDIC special assessment was\n$ 1.7billion and $ 2.1billion. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nFDIC\u2019s estimated loss to the DIF, which\ncould affect the amount of its accrued\nliability.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed below, whether a loss in\nexcess of any accrued liability is\nreasonably possible in future periods.\nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to\nbe both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued\nliability and record a corresponding\namount of litigation-related expense.\nThe Corporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n266million, $ 519million and $\n1.2billion was recognized in 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note for which a loss\nin future periods is reasonably possible\nand estimable (whether in excess of an\naccrued liability or where there is no\naccrued liability), the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 0.8billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America138                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon\ncurrently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the\naccrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may\nchange from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the\ncurrent estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not\nrepresent the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below\nregarding the nature of the litigation or other contingency and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account\naccrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising\nfrom pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a material\nadverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions\nand uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the\nCorporation\u2019s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some\nof those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be\nmaterial to the Corporation\u2019s business or results of operations for any particular\nreporting period, or cause significant reputational harm. Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Economic Sanctions Compliance BANA agreed to a Consent Order\nannounced by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on December 23,\n2024, and the Corporation continues to respond to requests for information from\nother regulators, relating to certain aspects of its BSA/AML and Economic\nSanctions Compliance Programs (Programs). Since late 2023, the Corporation has\nbeen working with regulators to make changes to its Programs and has already\ncompleted significant steps to satisfy requirements of the Consent Order. The\nCorporation does not believe that these issues relating to the Programs will have\na material adverse financial impact on the Corporation. CFPB Lawsuit Related to\nProcessing Electronic Payments On December 20, 2024, the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) filed suit against BANA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., and Early Warning Services, LLC in the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Arizona with respect to BANA\u2019s and co-defendants\u2019 processing of\nelectronic payments of funds through the Zelle network. The CFPB alleges that BANA\nand its co-defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by not\nadequately protecting consumers from fraud on the Zelle network and the Electronic\nFund Transfer Act by not reasonably investigating and reimbursing disputed Zelle\ntransfers, and seeks both monetary and injunctive relief. Deposit Insurance\nAssessment In 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of Columbia (District Court) alleging that BANA underpaid\nassessments to the DIF in the 2012-2014 time frame in the amount of $ 1.12billion\nand asserting claims under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and for unjust\nenrichment. The FDIC Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel\ninvestigation related to the same alleged underpayments. BANA disputes the FDIC\u2019s\nclaims and has asserted counterclaims challenging the FDIC\u2019s regulations under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security\nsatisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On\nJuly 1, 2024, the District Court judge vacated the magistrate judge\u2019s April 2023\nreport and recommendation for resolving the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary\njudgment, and asked the parties to file new motions. The parties subsequently\nfiled their new summary judgment motions, which are pending. LIBOR Beginning in\n2011, several individual and putative class actions were filed against the\nCorporation, BANA, and certain Merrill Lynch entities, as well as other banks on\nthe U.S. Dollar LIBOR panel. These actions alleged that defendants manipulated\nLIBOR during the financial crisis and asserted a variety of claims, including\nfederal and state antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud, and\nbreach of contract claims and sought compensatory, treble and punitive damages,\nand injunctive relief. All remaining cases are pending in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York. Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is\npending on all remaining claims, brought by individual plaintiffs and one class of\nplaintiffs who purchased over-the-counter instruments incorporating LIBOR.\nUnemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards Beginning in January 2021, BANA was named as\na defendant in putative class action and mass action lawsuits related to its\nadministration of prepaid debit cards to distribute unemployment and other state\nbenefits for the State of California, which was the largest program administered\nby BANA as measured by total benefits and number of participants. These lawsuits\nhave been consolidated into a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of California where plaintiffs assert claims for\nviolations of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, state statutory and common law\nclaims and due process, and seek monetary damages and injunctive relief based on\nallegations that BANA failed to properly investigate and remediate cardholder\nclaims of fraudulent transactions and to prevent fraud, among other allegations.\n                                                                                  \n  139Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 13 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n                                                                                  \n  Declared                                                                        \n  Quarterly Cash                                                                  \n  Dividends on                                                                    \n  Common Stock(1)                                                                 \n  Declaration                                                       Dividend Per  \n  Date               Record Date         Payment Date                      Share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January 29,        March 7, 2025       March 28, 2025      $              0.26  \n  2025                                                                            \n  October 16,        December 6, 2024    December 27,                       0.26  \n  2024                                   2024                                     \n  July 24, 2024      September 6,        September 27,                      0.26  \n                     2024                2024                                     \n  April 25, 2024     June 7, 2024        June 28, 2024                      0.24  \n  January 31,        March 1, 2024       March 29, 2024                     0.24  \n  2024                                                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe cash dividends paid per share of\ncommon stock were $ 1.00, $ 0.92and $\n0.86for 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe table below summarizes common stock\nrepurchases during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Common Stock Repurchase Summary                                                 \n  (in millions)                                                                   \n  Total share repurchases, including CCAR           2024        2023        2022  \n  capital plan repurchases                           332         147         126  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Purchase price of shares repurchased and     $  13,104    $  4,576    $  5,073  \n  retired(1)                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(1) Consists of repurchases pursuant to\nthe Corporation\u2019s CCAR capital plans.\nDuring 2024, in connection with employee\nstock plans, the Corporation issued\n75million shares of its common stock\nand, to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations, repurchased 28million\nshares of common stock.

With the exception of the Series B, F and G\nPreferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for threeor\nmore semi-annual or sixor more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether\nconsecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of\npreferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which\nequivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a\nsingle class) will be entitled to vote for the election of twoadditional\ndirectors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full\ndividends on these series for at least twosemi-annual or fourquarterly dividend\nperiods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage. The 7.25% Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does\nnot have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock\nmay be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20shares of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation\nmay cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time\nor from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-\napplicable conversion rate if, for 20trading days during any period of\n30consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130percent\nof the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a\nconversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder,\nsubsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the\nCorporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable.

capital adequacy rules, including Basel 3, for U.S. banking\norganizations. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to\ncapital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation\u2019s banking\nentity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC. The\nCorporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced\napproaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the\nCorporation and its\n\nbanking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital\nratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The\nCorporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)\nof 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers. The Corporation\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries\nare required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA framework. The following table presents capital ratios\nand related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced\napproaches as measured at December 31, 2024 and 2023 for the Corporation and BANA.\n                                                                                  \n  143Bank of America                                                              \n

of December 31, 2024 and 2023, capital ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the\nadoption of the current expected credit losses accounting standard on January 1,\n2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge of 3.0percent at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2.5percent at December 31, 2023, and SCB (under the\nStandardized approach) of 3.2percent at December 31, 2024 and 2.5percent at\nDecember 31, 2023. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods.\nThe SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 are\nthe minimum ratios under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of\n2.5percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends\nare the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA\nframework.\n\n(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to\nthe qualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the\nU.S. banking regulators require\ninstitutions to meet the established\nminimums outlined in the table above.\nFailure to meet the minimum requirements\ncan lead to certain mandatory and\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that\ncould have a material adverse impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s financial position. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nCorporation and its banking entity\naffiliates were well capitalized. Other\nRegulatory Matters At December 31, 2024\nand 2023, the Corporation had cash and\ncash equivalents in the amount of $\n4.0billion and $ 3.6billion, and\nsecurities with a fair value of $\n18.3billion and $ 18.0billion that were\nsegregated in compliance with securities\nregulations. Cash and cash equivalents\nsegregated in compliance with securities\nregulations are a component of\nrestricted cash. For more information,\nsee Note 10 \u2013 Securities Financing\nAgreements, Short-term Borrowings,\nCollateral and Restricted Cash . In\naddition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Corporation had cash deposited with\nclearing organizations of $ 21.5billion\nand $ 23.7billion primarily recorded in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nBank Subsidiary Distributions The\nprimary sources of funds for cash\ndistributions by the Corporation to its\nshareholders are capital distributions\nreceived from its bank subsidiaries,\nBANA and Bank of America California,\nN.A. In 2024, the Corporation received\ndividends of $ 20.8billion from BANA and\n$ 500million from Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A.\nThe amount of dividends that a\nsubsidiary bank may declare in a\ncalendar year without OCC approval is\nthe subsidiary bank\u2019s net profits for\nthat year combined with its retained net\nprofits for the preceding two years.\nRetained net profits, as defined by the\nOCC, consist of net income less\ndividends declared during the period. In\n2025, BANA can declare and pay dividends\nof approximately $ 13.0billion to the\nCorporation plus an additional amount\nequal to its retained net profits for\n2025 up to the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America144                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPension and Postretirement Plans The Corporation sponsors a qualified\nnoncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of\nnoncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement health and life\nplans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the\nCorporation vary based on the country and local practices. The Qualified Pension\nPlan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-\nselected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan\nthat effectively provides principal protection for participant balances\ntransferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for\nfunding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. Benefits earned under the\nQualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts\ncontinue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the\nterms of the plan document. The Corporation has an annuity contract that\nguarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan\n(Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be\nresponsible for or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of\nthe annuity assets. The Corporation made nocontribution under this agreement in\n2024 or 2023. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and\nprovide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees. In\naddition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible employees may\nbecome eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life\ninsurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans. The Pension and Postretirement Plans table\nsummarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected\nbenefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit\nobligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to\ndetermine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. The estimate of the Corporation\u2019s PBO associated with\nthese plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for\nmortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from\na cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated\ncorporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of\nthe plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2024 resulted\nin a decrease to the PBO of $ 767million at December 31, 2024. The decreases in\nthe weighted-average discount rates in 2023 resulted in an increase to the PBO of\napproximately $ 511million at December 31, 2023. Significant gains and losses\nrelated to changes in the PBO for 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from changes in\nthe discount rate.\n

Qualified Pension Plan recognizes\n60percent of the prior year\u2019s market gains or losses at the next measurement date\nwith the remaining 40percent spread equally over the subsequent four years. Gains\nand losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are recognized\nin accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable\naccounting guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was\ndetermined using the \u201cprojected unit credit\u201d actuarial method. For the U.S.\nPostretirement Health Plans, 50percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the\nbeginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level\nbasis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the\npostretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement\nHealth and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the\nexpected cost of benefits covered by the U.S. Postretirement Health and Life Plans\nis 6.25percent for 2025, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in 2028 and later years.\nThe Corporation\u2019s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is\nsensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the\nQualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension\nPlans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bps decline in discount\nrates and expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the\nnet periodic benefit cost for 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America146                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       4       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \nPlan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement\nvehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits\npromised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest\nthe trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing\nbenefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The\nCorporation\u2019s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over\nthe long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts\nto maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate\nby the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and\nlaws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant\nfor establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges\nare established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and\nliability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are\nemployed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional\naspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset\nallocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment\nmeasures. The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a\nU.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are invested prudently so that\nthe benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the\nnature and the duration of the plans\u2019 liabilities. The selected asset allocation\nstrategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The\nexpected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis\nof historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations,\ncurrent market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2019 past\nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected\nreturn on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related\nvalue for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value\nfor the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The\nexpected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of\nthe performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension\nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return\nthat may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension\nPlan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in\nfixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration\nof the plan\u2019s obligations. The target allocations for 2025 by asset category for\nthe Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other\nPension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the\nQualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $\n386million ( 2.19percent of total plan assets) and $ 299million ( 1.69percent of\ntotal plan assets) at December 31, 2024, and 2023.\n                                                                            \n  2025 Target Allocation                                                    \n                            Percentage                                      \n                            Qualified       Non-U.S.         Nonqualified   \n  Asset Category            Pension Plan    Pension Plans    and Other      \n                                                             Pension Plans  \n  Equity securities         10-40%          0-10%            0-5%           \n  Debt securities           50-85%          50-80%           95-100%        \n  Real estate               0-10%           0-10%            0-5%           \n  Other                     0-10%           20-45%           0-5%           \n                                                                            \nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the\nCorporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20\n\u2013 Fair Value Measurements .

The Corporation\nrecorded expense of $ 1.3billion in 2024\nand $ 1.2billion in both 2023 and 2022\nrelated to the qualified defined\ncontribution plans. At December 31, 2024\nand 2023, 153million and 178million\nshares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock\nwere held by these plans. Payments to\nthe plans for dividends on common stock\nwere $ 165million, $ 166million and $\n153million in 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Certain non-U.S. employees\nare covered under defined contribution\npension plans that are separately\nadministered in accordance with local\nlaws. NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation\nPlans The Corporation administers a\nnumber of equity compensation plans,\nwith awards being granted predominantly\nfrom the Bank of America Corporation\nEquity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan,\n890million shares of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommon stock are authorized to be used\nfor grants of awards. During 2024 and\n2023, the Corporation granted 121million\nand 115million RSUs to certain employees\nunder the BACEP. These RSUs were\nauthorized to settle predominantly in\nshares of common stock of the\nCorporation. Certain RSUs will be\nsettled in cash or contain settlement\nprovisions that subject these awards to\nvariable accounting whereby compensation\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based\non changes in the share price of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock up to the\nsettlement date. The RSUs granted in\n2024 and 2023 predominantly vest over\nfour yearsin one-fourth increments on\neach of the first four anniversaries of\nthe grant date, provided that the\nemployee remains continuously employed\nwith the Corporation during that time,\nand will be expensed ratably over the\nvesting period, net of estimated\nforfeitures, for non-retirement eligible\nemployees based on the grant-date fair\nvalue of the shares. Of the RSUs granted\nin 2024 and 2023, 42million in each year\ndo not include retirement eligibility.\nFor all other RSUs granted to employees\nwho are retirement eligible, they are\ndeemed authorized as of the beginning of\nthe year preceding the grant date when\nthe incentive award plans are generally\napproved. As a result, the estimated\nvalue is expensed ratably over the year\npreceding the grant date. The\ncompensation cost for the stock-based\nplans was $ 3.6billion, $ 3.1billion and\n$ 2.9billion, and the related income tax\nbenefit was $ 872million, $ 733million\nand $ 697million for 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. At December 31,\n2024, there was an estimated $\n4.3billion of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to certain\nshare-based compensation awards that is\nexpected to be recognized generally over\na period of up to four years, with a\nweighted-average period of 2.4years.\n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock\nUnits\nThe total fair value of restricted stock\nand restricted stock units vested in\n2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 2.6billion, $\n2.6billion and $ 3.4billion,\nrespectively.

which resulted in a\nnegative tax adjustment of approximately\n$ 186million, with corresponding\nadjustments of U.K. net deferred tax\nassets. The U.K. net deferred tax assets\nare primarily net operating losses\n(NOLs), incurred by the Corporation\u2019s\nU.K. broker-dealer entity in historical\nperiods, which do not expire under U.K.\ntax law and are assessed regularly for\nimpairment. If further U.K. tax law\nchanges are enacted, a corresponding\nincome tax adjustment will be made based\non the amount of available net deferred\ntax assets and applicable tax rate\nchanges. Tax credits originate from\ninvestments in affordable housing and\nrenewable energy partnerships and\nsimilar entities. Significant increases\nin tax credits recognized in 2024 and\n2023, compared to 2022, were primarily\ndriven by the Corporation\u2019s growth in\nthe volume of investments in wind and\nsolar energy production facilities.

     \n(1) Represents U.K. broker-dealer net\noperating losses that may be carried\nforward indefinitely.\n(2) The net operating losses and related\nvaluation allowances for U.S. states\nbefore considering the benefit of\nfederal deductions were $ 664million and\n$ 459million.\nManagement concluded that novaluation\nallowance was necessary to reduce the\ndeferred tax assets related to the U.K.\nNOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and\ncertain state NOL carryforwards since\nestimated future taxable income will be\nsufficient to utilize these assets prior\nto their expiration. Additionally, the\nCorporation has U.K. net deferred tax\nassets, which consist primarily of NOLs\nthat are expected to be realized in a\nU.K. subsidiary over an extended number\nof years. Management\u2019s conclusion is\nsupported by financial results, profit\nforecasts for the relevant entity and\nthe indefinite period to carry forward\nNOLs. However, a material change in\nthose estimates could lead management to\nreassess such valuation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, U.S. federal\nincome taxes had not been provided on\napproximately $ 5.0billion of temporary\ndifferences associated with investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries that are\nessentially permanent in duration. If\nthe Corporation were to record the\nassociated deferred tax liability, the\namount would be approximately $\n1.0billion.\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value\nis defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\non the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity\nto maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels\nbased on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace, or when\npreviously insignificant unobservable and observable inputs become significant,\nrespectively. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the\nCorporation measures fair value, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the\nfair value option. For more information, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option .\nValuation Techniques The following sections outline the valuation methodologies\nfor the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,\nthe use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value\nat the reporting date. During 2024, there were no significant changes to valuation\napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of\ntrading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded\nmarkets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed\ntransactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted\nmarket prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant\nfactor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and\nliabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available\nfor some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity\nhas slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a\ndiscounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using\ninternal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that\nincorporate management\u2019s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default\nrates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are\ndiscounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with\nadjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in\ndetermining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued\nusing a net asset value approach that considers the value of the underlying\nsecurities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where\navailable, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of\nilliquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of credit\nuncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these\n                                                                                  \n  151Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \ninstances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information\nand other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements\nand changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded\nin the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple\nmarket inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous\nyield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority\nof market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nWhen third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are\nreviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and\nliability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates\nwhere observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in\nwhich case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios\nare used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and\nliabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality\nand other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the\nCorporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a\nvaluation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position.\nPositions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is\nadjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures\nis adjusted for the Corporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation also\nincorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on\nuncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not\npermitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is\nalso used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\nLoans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based\non market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-\nbased credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the\nspecific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow\nanalyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or\nthe perceived credit risk of the borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair\nvalues of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation\napproach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs.\nThis approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest\nrate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount\nrates. Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market\nprices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows\nusing interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2019s current origination rates for\nsimilar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific\ncredit risk is embedded within the market prices, where available, or is implied\nby considering loan performance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings\nand Long-term Debt The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons\nor repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities,\ninterest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these\nstructured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined\nderivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable\nand, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest\nrate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and\ncorrelations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its\nown credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these\nliabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in\nthe secondary bond market. Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of\ncertain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including\ndiscounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs\nincluding interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing\ncurves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted\nand can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. Deposits The fair values of\ndeposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow\nmodels that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and\nspreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors.\nThe majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through\nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing\nservices. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the\nvaluation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to\nobservable credit spreads in the secondary cash market. Asset-backed Secured\nFinancings The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on\nexternal broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated\ncash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2019s current\norigination rates for similar loans, adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.\n

liabilities and net derivative assets\n(liabilities), the weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair\nvalue of the instruments.\n\n(2) The categories are aggregated based upon product type, which differs from\nfinancial statement classification. The following is a reconciliation to the line\nitems in the table on page 154: Trading account assets \u2013 Corporate securities,\ntrading loans and other of $ 1.7billion, Trading account assets \u2013 Non-U.S.\nsovereign debt of $ 396million, Trading account assets \u2013 Mortgage trading loans,\nMBS and ABS of $ 1.2billion, AFS debt securities of $ 376million, Other debt\nsecurities carried at fair value - Non-agency residential of $ 69million, Other\nassets, including MSRs, of $ 1.7billion, Loans and leases of $ 93million and LHFS\nof $ 164million.\n\n(3) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes.\n\n(4) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation, Black-Scholes and other\nmethods that model the joint dynamics of interest, inflation and foreign exchange\nrates.\n\n(5) The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest,\nprepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions.\n\nCPR = Constant Prepayment Rate\n\nCDR = Constant Default Rate\n\nMMBtu = Million British thermal units\n\nIR = Interest Rate\n\nFX = Foreign Exchange\n\nn/a = not applicable\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America158                                                              \n                                                                                  \nIn the previous tables, instruments\nbacked by residential and commercial\nreal estate assets include RMBS,\ncommercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage\nCDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities\nand other include corporate CLOs and\nCDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and\nsecurities backed by non-real estate\nassets. Structured liabilities primarily\ninclude equity-linked notes that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. The Corporation uses multiple\nmarket approaches in valuing certain of\nits Level 3 financial instruments. For\nexample, market comparables and\ndiscounted cash flows are used together.\nFor a given product, such as corporate\ndebt securities, market comparables may\nbe used to estimate some of the\nunobservable inputs, and then these\ninputs are incorporated into a\ndiscounted cash flow model. Therefore,\nthe balances disclosed encompass both of\nthese techniques. The levels of\naggregation and diversity within the\nproducts disclosed in the tables result\nin certain ranges of inputs being wide\nand unevenly distributed across asset\nand liability categories. Uncertainty of\nFair Value Measurements from\nUnobservable Inputs Loans and Securities\nA significant increase in market yields,\ndefault rates, loss severities or\nduration would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value for long\npositions. Short positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. The impact of changes in\nprepayment speeds would have resulted in\ndiffering impacts depending on the\nseniority of the instrument and, in the\ncase of CLOs, whether prepayments can be\nreinvested. A significant increase in\nprice would have resulted in a\nsignificantly higher fair value for long\npositions, and short positions would\nhave been impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. Structured Liabilities and\nDerivatives For credit derivatives, a\nsignificant increase in market yield,\nupfront points (i.e., a single upfront\npayment made by a\n\nprotection buyer at inception), credit\nspreads, default rates or loss\nseverities would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value for\nprotection sellers and higher fair value\nfor protection buyers. The impact of\nchanges in prepayment speeds would have\nresulted in differing impacts depending\non the seniority of the instrument.\nStructured credit derivatives are\nimpacted by credit correlation. Default\ncorrelation is a parameter that\ndescribes the degree of dependence among\ncredit default rates within a credit\nportfolio that underlies a credit\nderivative instrument. The sensitivity\nof this input on the fair value varies\ndepending on the level of subordination\nof the tranche. For senior tranches that\nare net purchases of protection, a\nsignificant increase in default\ncorrelation would have resulted in a\nsignificantly higher fair value. Net\nshort protection positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. For equity derivatives,\ncommodity derivatives, interest rate\nderivatives and structured liabilities,\na significant change in long-dated rates\nand volatilities and correlation inputs\n(i.e., the degree of correlation between\nan equity security and an index, between\ntwo different commodities, between two\ndifferent interest rates, or between\ninterest rates and foreign exchange\nrates) would have resulted in a\nsignificant impact to the fair value;\nhowever, the magnitude and direction of\nthe impact depend on whether the\nCorporation is long or short the\nexposure. For structured liabilities, a\nsignificant increase in yield or\ndecrease in price would have resulted in\na significantly lower fair value.\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation\nholds certain assets that are measured\nat fair value only in certain situations\n(e.g., the impairment of an asset), and\nthese measurements are referred to\nherein as nonrecurring.

and Loan Commitments The Corporation elects to account for certain loans and\nloan commitments that exceed the Corporation\u2019s single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments are\nactively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships\nmay be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation\u2019s\npublic side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of\nthe hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for\ndesignation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair value\noption allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair\nvalue, which is more consistent with management\u2019s view of the underlying economics\nand the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option\nallows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise\nresult from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage\nLHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option. These loans are actively\nmanaged and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may\nbe mitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to\ndesignate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are\ncarried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset\nby changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from\nthe asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of\ncost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not\nelected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily\nbecause these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative\ninstruments.\n\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets The Corporation elects to account for\ncertain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a\nfair value basis under the fair value option. Other Assets The Corporation elects\nto account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with\nderivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows\nthe Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at fair value. Securities Financing Agreements\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements,\nincluding resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These\nelections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and its\nagencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.\nLong-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-\nrate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to\nreduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the\nderivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-\nterm deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. Short-\nterm Borrowings The Corporation elects to account for certain short-term\nborrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value\noption because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America160                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-backed secured\nfinancings, which are also classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair\nvalue option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created\nby accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the\ncorresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. Long-term\nDebt The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily\nstructured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is either\nrisk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge\naccounting. Fair Value Option Elections The following tables provide information\nabout the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of\nassets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31,\n2024 and 2023, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and\nliabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in

The\nCorporation does not estimate the fair value of consumer unfunded lending\ncommitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these\ncommitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on\ncommitments, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies.\n\nNOTE 23 Business Segment Information The Corporation reports its results of\noperations through the following fourbusiness segments: Consumer Banking , Global\nWealth & Investment Management, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the\nremaining operations recorded in All Other . The segments are managed by the\nCorporation\u2019s Management Team, with certain leaders responsible for each segment\nand/or the lines of business supporting the segments. On a continual basis, the\nManagement Team assesses the performance of the segments by comparing the\nsegments\u2019 budgeted income and expenses to their actual results. The Chief\nOperating Decision Maker of the segments, which is the Corporation\u2019s CEO, is the\nfinal approver on the amount of capital to allocate to each segment. Consumer\nBanking Consumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking and\ninvestment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Consumer\nBanking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market\nsavings accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and\nproducts, as well as credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity\nloans, and direct and indirect loans to consumers and small businesses in the U.S.\nConsumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home\nequity loans. Global Wealth & Investment Management GWIM provides a high-touch\nclient experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with\nover $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet\nclients\u2019 needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and\nretirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions\ntargeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized\nsolutions to meet clients\u2019 wealth structuring, investment management, trust and\nbanking needs, including specialty asset management services. Global Banking\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services,\nintegrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and\nadvisory services through the Corporation\u2019s network of offices and client\nrelationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment banking products to\nclients. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities\nare shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal\nrevenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients generally include middle-\nmarket companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large\nglobal corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized\nU.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and\nsolutions.\n                                                                                  \n  163Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nGlobal Markets Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research\nservices to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity\nand equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-making, financing,\nsecurities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional\ninvestor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global\nMarkets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the\nprimary and secondary markets. Global Markets also works with commercial and\ncorporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of market-\nmaking activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range\nof financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking\nand underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global\nBanking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. All Other All Other\nprimarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses\nnot otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest\nrate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all\nof the results are allocated to the business segments. All Other includes income\ntax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits\nrecorded in Global Banking and Global Markets . Basis of Presentation The\nmanagement accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results\nby utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income\nderived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an\nactivity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and\nassumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the\nbusiness. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on\nan FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an\nFTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment\nresults also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized\nto determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the\nresults of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities\nwith similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments\nwhere the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally\ndeposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities.\nNet interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net\ninterest income generated by certain of the Corporation\u2019s ALM activities. The\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management\nstrategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to\nmanage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and\ncapital. The results of a majority of the Corporation\u2019s ALM activities are\nallocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the\nALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions\nincluding deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation\u2019s internal\nfunds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.

Geographical Area\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s operations are highly integrated with operations in both U.S.\nand non-U.S. markets. The non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa and in Asia.
