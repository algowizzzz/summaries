The Company continued to deliver on its commitment to help diverse\nentrepreneurs thrive, ultimately driving economic opportunity and investment in\nits communities. The Company\u2019s current $430+ million portfolio of more than 130\nfunds will ultimately invest in more than 2,000 minority- and women-led companies\nover the next five years. Additionally, over the course of 2022, employees gave\nnearly two million volunteer hours and directed more than $68 million in combined\nindividual giving and the Company\u2019s matching gifts, volunteer grants and other\nemployee-directed giving programs.\n\nThe Company was recognized in 2022 as the World\u2019s Best Bank by Euromoney .\n\nCompensation Structure . The Board determined that Mr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation\nstructure continues to be composed of base salary, time-based restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d), and performance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan\u2019s annual base salary remains\n$1.5 million. The aggregate value of his 2022 equity incentive awarded by the\nBoard is $28.5 million. Consistent with prior years, there is no cash bonus. The\nincentive is comprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that will vest over the next 12\nmonths, 20% of stock-settled RSUs that will vest annually over the next four\nyears, and 50% of performance RSUs that will be re-earned only if Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s future financial performance meets specific standards.\n\nThe overall structure of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2022 performance RSUs remains consistent\nwith the structure over the prior 10 years, during which time shareholders voted\nto approve the Company\u2019s executive compensation program through the annual\nadvisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d process with an average of 94.5% support. The performance\nRSUs awarded to Mr. Moynihan continue to use a\n\n\u201cre-earn\u201d approach, vesting only if the Company meets specific performance\nstandards over a three-year period (from 2023 through 2025). Under this \u201cre-earn\u201d\napproach, future performance of the Company below the standards of the performance\nRSUs will decrease the amount ultimately paid; 100% is the maximum payout if\nstandards are met. The three-year average return on assets and three-year average\ngrowth in adjusted tangible book value standards for the performance RSUs are\nunchanged from last year.\n\nAdditionally, all of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2022 equity incentive awards are subject to\nthe Company\u2019s stock ownership and retention requirements. Specifically, 50% of the\nnet after-tax shares he receives from equity awards must be retained until one\nyear after his retirement. These equity awards also are subject to the Company\u2019s\ncancellation and clawback policies.\n                                                                                  \n                                    SIGNATURES                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the\nRegistrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                                             \n  BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION                                \n  By:                            /s/ Ross E.
