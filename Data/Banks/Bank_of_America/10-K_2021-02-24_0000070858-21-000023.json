Additionally, there has been a     \u2502\n\u2502  decline in global economic activity, reduced U.S.    \u2502\n\u2502  and global economic output and a deterioration in    \u2502\n\u2502  macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally.   \u2502\n\u2502  This has resulted in, among other things, higher     \u2502\n\u2502  rates of unemployment and underemployment and        \u2502\n\u2502  caused volatility and disruptions in the global      \u2502\n\u2502  financial markets during 2020, including the energy  \u2502\n\u2502  and commodity markets.In response to the pandemic,   \u2502\n\u2502  the Corporation has been taking a proactive role in  \u2502\n\u2502  addressing the impact of the pandemic on its         \u2502\n\u2502  employees, its operations, its clients and the       \u2502\n\u2502  community, including the implementation of           \u2502\n\u2502  protocols and processes to execute its business      \u2502\n\u2502  continuity plans and help protect its employees and  \u2502\n\u2502  support its clients.

Our\nBoard and its committees,\nincluding the Compensation\nand Human Capital, Audit,\nEnterprise Risk, and\nCorporate Governance, ESG\nand Sustainability\nCommittees, provide\noversight of our human\ncapital management\nstrategies, programs and\npractices. The Corporation\u2019s\nsenior management provides\nregular briefings on human\ncapital matters to the Board\nand its Committees to\nfacilitate the Board\u2019s\noversight.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the Corporation\nemployed approximately\n213,000 and 208,000\nemployees, of which 82\npercent were located in the\nU.S. at both dates. None of\nour U.S. employees are\nsubject to a collective\nbargaining agreement.\nAdditionally, in 2020 and\n2019, the Corporation\u2019s\ncompensation and benefits\nexpense was $32.7 billion\nand $32.0 billion, or 59\npercent and 58 percent, of\ntotal noninterest expense.\n                                                         \n  Diversity and Inclusion                                \n                                                         \nThe Corporation\u2019s commitment\nto diversity and inclusion\nstarts at the top of the\nCorporation with oversight\nfrom our Board and CEO. The\nCorporation\u2019s senior\nmanagement sets the\ndiversity and inclusion\ngoals of the Corporation,\nand the Chief Human\nResources Officer and Chief\nDiversity & Inclusion\nOfficer partner with our CEO\nand senior management to\ndrive our diversity and\ninclusion strategy,\nprograms, initiatives and\npolicies. The Global\nDiversity and Inclusion\nCouncil, which consists of\nsenior executives from every\nline of business and is\nchaired by our CEO, has been\nin place for over 20 years.\nThe Council sponsors and\nsupports business, operating\nunit and regional diversity\nand inclusion councils to\nensure alignment to\nenterprise diversity\nstrategies and goals.\n\nOur practices and policies\nhave resulted in strong\nrepresentation across the\nCorporation where our broad\nemployee population mirrors\nthe clients and communities\nwe serve. We have a Board\nand senior management team\nthat are 47 percent and 50\npercent racially, ethnically\nand gender diverse. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, over 50\npercent of employees were\nwomen, and, among U.S.-based\nemployees, nearly 48 percent\nwere people of color, 14\npercent were Black/African\nAmerican and 19 percent were\nHispanic/Latino. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nCorporation\u2019s top three\nmanagement levels in\nrelation to the CEO were\ncomposed of more than 42\npercent women and nearly 20\npercent people of color.\nThese workforce diversity\nmetrics are reported\nregularly to the senior\nmanagement team and to the\nBoard and are publicly\ndisclosed on our website.\n\nWe invest in our leadership\nby offering a range of\ndevelopment programs and\nresources that allow\nemployees to develop and\nprogress in their careers.\nWe reinforce our commitment\nto diversity and inclusion\nby investing internally in\nour employee networks and by\nfacilitating conversations\nwith employees about racial,\nsocial and economic issues.\nFurther, we partner with\nvarious external\norganizations, which focus\non advancing diverse talent.\nWe also have practices in\nplace for attracting and\nretaining diverse talent,\nincluding campus\nrecruitment. For example, in\n2020, approximately 45\npercent of our campus hires\nwere women, and, in the\nU.S., approximately 54\npercent were people of\ncolor.\n                                                         \n  Employee Engagement and Talent Retention               \n                                                         \nAs part of our ongoing\nefforts to make the\nCorporation a great place to\nwork, we have conducted a\nconfidential annual Employee\nEngagement Survey (Survey)\nfor nearly two decades. The\nSurvey results are reviewed\nby the Board and senior\nmanagement and used to\nassist in reviewing the\nCorporation\u2019s human capital\nstrategies, programs and\npractices. In 2020, more\nthan 90 percent of the\nCorporation\u2019s employees\nparticipated in the Survey,\nand our Employee Engagement\nIndex, an overall measure of\nemployee satisfaction with\nthe Corporation, was 91\npercent. In 2020, we also\nhad historically low\nturnover among our employees\nof seven percent.\n                                                         \n  Fair and Equitable Compensation                        \n                                                         \nThe Corporation is committed\nto racial and gender pay\nequity by striving to fairly\nand equitably compensate all\nof our employees. We\nmaintain robust policies and\npractices that reinforce our\ncommitment, including\nreviews with oversight from\nour Board and senior\nmanagement. In 2020, our\nreview covered our regional\nhubs (U.S., U.K., France,\nIreland, Hong Kong, and\nSingapore) and India and\nshowed that compensation\nreceived by women, on\naverage, was greater than 99\npercent of that received by\nmen in comparable positions\nand, in the U.S.,\ncompensation received by\npeople of color was, on\naverage, greater than 99\npercent of that received by\nteammates who are not people\nof color in comparable\npositions.\n\nWe also strive to pay our\nemployees fairly based on\nmarket rates for their\nroles, experience and how\nthey perform, and we\nregularly benchmark against\nother companies both within\nand outside our industry to\nhelp ensure our pay is\ncompetitive. In the first\nquarter of 2020, we raised\nour minimum hourly wage for\nU.S. employees to $20 per\nhour, which is above all\ngovernmental minimum wage\nlevels in all jurisdictions\nin which we operate in the\nU.S.\n                                                         \n  Health and Wellness \u2013 2020 Focus                       \n                                                         \nThe Corporation also is\ncommitted to supporting\nemployees\u2019 physical,\nemotional and financial\nwellness by offering\nflexible and competitive\nbenefits, including\ncomprehensive health and\ninsurance benefits and\nwellness resources. In 2020,\nwe took steps to support our\nemployees during the ongoing\nhealth crisis resulting from\nthe pandemic, including\nmonitoring guidance from the\nU.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention,\nmedical boards and health\nauthorities and sharing such\nguidance with our employees.\nIn addition, as a result of\nthe pandemic we transitioned\nto a work-from-home posture\nfor the substantial majority\nof our employees and\nprovided various benefits\nand resources related to the\npandemic, including the\nimplementation of child and\nadult care solutions,\noffering no-cost COVID-19\ntesting and mental health\nresources and additional\nsupport for teammates who\nwork in the office, such as\ntransportation and meal\nsubsidies. We continue to\nengage with state and\nnational governments to\nunderstand their vaccination\nplans for essential workers,\nincluding the extent to\nwhich that may include some\nof our employees, and with\nour employees to educate\nthem about vaccines and the\nimportance of being\nvaccinated.

U.S. federal\nregulation of banks, BHCs\nand financial holding\ncompanies is intended\nprimarily for the protection\nof depositors and the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (DIF)\nrather than for the\nprotection of shareholders\nand creditors.\n\nAs a registered financial\nholding company and BHC, the\nCorporation is subject to\nthe supervision of, and\nregular inspection by, the\nBoard of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve). Our U.S.\nbank subsidiaries (the\nBanks), organized as\nnational banking\nassociations, are subject to\nregulation, supervision and\nexamination by the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC), the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) and the\nFederal Reserve. In\naddition, the Federal\nReserve and the OCC have\nadopted guidelines that\nestablish minimum standards\nfor the design,\nimplementation and board\noversight of BHCs\u2019 and\nnational banks\u2019 risk\ngovernance frameworks. U.S.\nfinancial holding companies,\nand the companies under\ntheir control, are permitted\nto engage in activities\nconsidered \u201cfinancial in\nnature\u201d as defined by the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and\nrelated Federal Reserve\ninterpretations. The\nCorporation's status as a\nfinancial holding company is\nconditioned upon maintaining\ncertain eligibility\nrequirements for both the\nCorporation and its U.S.\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries, including\nminimum capital ratios,\nsupervisory ratings and, in\nthe case of the depository\ninstitutions, at least\nsatisfactory Community\nReinvestment Act ratings.\nFailure to be an eligible\nfinancial holding company\ncould result in the Federal\nReserve limiting Bank of\nAmerica's activities,\nincluding potential\nacquisitions.\n\nThe scope of the laws and\nregulations and the\nintensity of the supervision\nto which we are subject have\nincreased over the past\nseveral years, beginning\nwith the response to the\nfinancial crisis, as well as\nother factors such as\ntechnological and market\nchanges. In addition, the\nbanking and financial\nservices sector is subject\nto substantial regulatory\nenforcement and fines. Many\nof these changes have\noccurred as a result of the\n2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the\nFinancial Reform Act). We\ncannot assess whether there\nwill be any additional major\nchanges in the regulatory\nenvironment and expect that\nour business will remain\nsubject to continuing and\nextensive regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nWe are also subject to\nvarious other laws and\nregulations, as well as\nsupervision and examination\nby other regulatory\nagencies, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly\naffect our entities and\nmanagement and our ability\nto make distributions to\nshareholders. For instance,\nour broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to\nboth U.S. and international\nregulation, including\nsupervision by the SEC,\nFinancial Industry\nRegulatory Authority and New\nYork Stock Exchange, among\nothers; our futures\ncommission merchant\nsubsidiaries supporting\ncommodities and derivatives\nbusinesses in the U.S. are\nsubject to regulation by and\nsupervision of the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC), National\nFutures Association, the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange\nand in the case of the\nBanks, certain banking\nregulators; our insurance\nactivities are subject to\nlicensing and regulation by\nstate insurance regulatory\nagencies; and our consumer\nfinancial products and\nservices are regulated by\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are\nalso subject to extensive\nregulation by various\nnon-U.S. regulators,\nincluding governments,\nsecurities exchanges,\nprudential regulators,\ncentral banks and other\nregulatory bodies, in the\njurisdictions in which those\nbusinesses operate. For\nexample, our financial\n\nservices entities in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.),\nIreland and France are\nsubject to regulation by the\nPrudential Regulatory\nAuthority and Financial\nConduct Authority, the\nEuropean Central Bank and\nCentral Bank of Ireland, and\nthe Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution\nand Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s\nFinanciers, respectively.\n                                                         \n  Source of Strength                                     \n                                                         \nUnder the Financial Reform\nAct and Federal Reserve\npolicy, BHCs are expected to\nact as a source of financial\nstrength to each subsidiary\nbank and to commit resources\nto support each such\nsubsidiary. Similarly, under\nthe cross-guarantee\nprovisions of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act\nof 1991 (FDICIA), in the\nevent of a loss suffered or\nanticipated by the FDIC,\neither as a result of\ndefault of a bank subsidiary\nor related to FDIC\nassistance provided to such\na subsidiary in danger of\ndefault, the affiliate banks\nof such a subsidiary may be\nassessed for the FDIC\u2019s\nloss, subject to certain\nexceptions.\n                                                         \n  Transactions with Affiliates                           \n                                                         \nPursuant to Section 23A and\n23B of the Federal Reserve\nAct, as implemented by the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Regulation\nW, the Banks are subject to\nrestrictions that limit\ncertain types of\ntransactions between the\nBanks and their nonbank\naffiliates. In general, U.S.\nbanks are subject to\nquantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of\ncredit, purchases of assets\nand certain other\ntransactions involving their\nnonbank affiliates.\nAdditionally, transactions\nbetween U.S. banks and their\nnonbank affiliates are\nrequired to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms and must be\nconsistent with standards of\nsafety and soundness.\n                                                         \n  Deposit Insurance                                      \n                                                         \nDeposits placed at U.S.\ndomiciled banks are insured\nby the FDIC, subject to\nlimits and conditions of\napplicable law and the\nFDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant\nto the Financial Reform Act,\nFDIC insurance coverage\nlimits are $250,000 per\ncustomer. All insured\ndepository institutions are\nrequired to pay assessments\nto the FDIC in order to fund\nthe DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to\nmaintain at least a\ndesignated minimum ratio of\nthe DIF to insured deposits\nin the U.S. The FDIC adopted\nregulations that establish a\nlong-term target DIF ratio\nof greater than two percent.\nAs of the date of this\nreport, the DIF ratio is\nbelow this required target,\nand the FDIC has adopted a\nrestoration plan that may\nresult in increased deposit\ninsurance assessments.\nDeposit insurance assessment\nrates are subject to change\nby the FDIC and will be\nimpacted by the overall\neconomy and the stability of\nthe banking industry as a\nwhole.

These\nrules are complex and are\nevolving as U.S. and\ninternational regulatory\nauthorities propose and\nenact amendments to these\nrules. The Corporation seeks\nto manage its capital\nposition to maintain\nsufficient capital to\nsatisfy these regulatory\nrules and to support our\nbusiness activities. These\ncontinually evolving rules\nare likely to influence our\nplanning processes and may\nrequire additional\nregulatory capital and\nliquidity, as well as impose\nadditional operational and\ncompliance costs on the\nCorporation.\n\nFor more information on\nregulatory capital rules,\ncapital composition and\npending or proposed\nregulatory capital\n                                                         \n  Bank of America4                                       \n                                                         \nchanges, see Capital\nManagement on page 50, and\nNote 16 \u2013 Regulatory\nRequirements and\nRestrictions to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements, which are\nincorporated by reference in\nthis Item 1.\n                                                         \n  Distributions                                          \n                                                         \nWe are subject to various\nregulatory policies and\nrequirements relating to\ncapital actions, including\npayment of dividends and\ncommon stock repurchases.\nFor instance, Federal\nReserve regulations require\nmajor U.S. BHCs to submit a\ncapital plan as part of an\nannual Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR).\n\nOur ability to pay dividends\nand make common stock\nrepurchases depends in part\non our ability to maintain\nregulatory capital levels\nabove minimum requirements\nplus buffers and non-capital\nstandards established under\nthe FDICIA. To the extent\nthat the Federal Reserve\nincreases our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB), global\nsystemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge or\ncountercyclical capital\nbuffer, our returns of\ncapital to shareholders\ncould decrease. As part of\nits CCAR, the Federal\nReserve conducts stress\ntesting on parts of our\nbusiness using hypothetical\neconomic scenarios prepared\nby the Federal Reserve.\nThose scenarios may affect\nour CCAR stress test\nresults, which may impact\nthe level of our SCB.\nAdditionally, the Federal\nReserve may impose\nlimitations or prohibitions\non taking capital actions\nsuch as paying or increasing\ncommon stock dividends or\nrepurchasing common stock.\nFor example, as a result of\nthe economic uncertainty\nresulting from the pandemic,\nthe Federal Reserve required\nthat during the second half\nof 2020, all large banks,\nincluding the Corporation,\nsuspend share repurchase\nprograms, except for\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans, and\nlimit common stock dividends\nto existing rates that did\nnot exceed the average of\nthe last four quarters' net\nincome. In the first quarter\nof 2021, the Federal Reserve\nlifted the suspension of\nshare repurchase programs\nand permitted large banks to\npay common stock dividends\nand to repurchase shares in\nan amount that, when\ncombined with dividends\npaid, does not exceed the\naverage of net income over\nthe last four quarters.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds\nthat any of our Banks are\nnot \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or\n\u201cwell-managed,\u201d we would be\nrequired to enter into an\nagreement with the Federal\nReserve to comply with all\napplicable capital and\nmanagement requirements,\nwhich may contain additional\nlimitations or conditions\nrelating to our activities.\nAdditionally, the applicable\nfederal regulatory authority\nis authorized to determine,\nunder certain circumstances\nrelating to the financial\ncondition of a bank or BHC,\nthat the payment of\ndividends would be an unsafe\nor unsound practice and to\nprohibit payment thereof.\n\nFor more information\nregarding the requirements\nrelating to the payment of\ndividends, including the\nminimum capital\nrequirements, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity and\nNote 16 \u2013 Regulatory\nRequirements and\nRestrictions to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries,\nincluding our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nare subject to laws that\nrestrict dividend payments,\nor authorize regulatory\nbodies to block or reduce\nthe flow of funds from those\nsubsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other\nsubsidiaries. The rights of\nthe Corporation, our\nshareholders and our\ncreditors to participate in\nany distribution of the\nassets or earnings of our\nsubsidiaries is further\nsubject to the prior claims\nof creditors of the\nrespective subsidiaries.\n                                                         \n  Resolution Planning                                    \n                                                         \nAs a BHC with greater than\n$250 billion of assets, the\nCorporation is required by\nthe Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC to periodically submit\na plan for a rapid and\norderly resolution in the\nevent of material financial\ndistress or failure.\n\nSuch resolution plan is\nintended to be a detailed\nroadmap for the orderly\nresolution of the BHC,\nincluding the continued\noperations or solvent wind\ndown of its material\nentities, pursuant to the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code under\none or more hypothetical\nscenarios assuming no\nextraordinary government\nassistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC determine that\nthe BHC\u2019s plan is not\ncredible, the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC may\njointly impose more\nstringent capital, leverage\nor liquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on growth,\nactivities or operations. A\nsummary of our plan is\navailable on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the\nsubmission of a resolution\nplan for Bank of America,\nNational Association (BANA),\nwhich must describe how the\ninsured depository\ninstitution would be\nresolved under the bank\nresolution provisions of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nAct. A description of this\nplan is available on the\nFDIC\u2019s website.\n\nWe continue to make\nsubstantial progress to\nenhance our resolvability,\nincluding simplifying our\nlegal entity structure and\nbusiness operations, and\nincreasing our preparedness\nto implement our resolution\nplan, both from a financial\nand operational standpoint.\n\nAcross international\njurisdictions, resolution\nplanning is the\nresponsibility of national\nresolution authorities (RA).\nAmong those, the\njurisdictions of most impact\nto the Corporation are the\nrequirements associated with\nsubsidiaries in the U.K.,\nIreland and France, where\nrules have been issued\nrequiring the submission of\nsignificant information\nabout locally-incorporated\nsubsidiaries (including\ninformation on intra-group\ndependencies, legal entity\nseparation and barriers to\nresolution) as well as the\nCorporation\u2019s banking\nbranches located in those\njurisdictions that are\ndeemed to be material for\nresolution planning\npurposes. As a result of the\nRA's review of the submitted\ninformation, we could be\nrequired to take certain\nactions over the next\nseveral years that could\nincrease operating costs and\npotentially result in the\nrestructuring of certain\nbusinesses and subsidiaries.\n\nFor more information\nregarding our resolution\nplan, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Liquidity on page\n9.\n                                                         \n  Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority       \n                                                         \nUnder the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act, the FDIC may\nbe appointed receiver of an\ninsured depository\ninstitution if it is\ninsolvent or in certain\nother circumstances. In\naddition, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nsystemically important\nfinancial institution (SIFI)\nsuch as the Corporation is\nin default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be\nappointed receiver in order\nto conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such\ninstitution. In the event of\nsuch appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things,\ninvoke the orderly\nliquidation authority,\ninstead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury\nmakes certain financial\ndistress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. The orderly\nliquidation authority is\nmodeled in part on the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nAct, but also adopts certain\nconcepts from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nThe orderly liquidation\nauthority contains certain\ndifferences from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. For\nexample, in certain\ncircumstances, the FDIC\ncould permit payment of\nobligations it determines to\nbe systemically significant\n(e.g., short-term\n                                                         \n  5Bank of America                                       \n                                                         \ncreditors or operating\ncreditors) in lieu of paying\nother obligations (e.g.,\nlong-term creditors) without\nthe need to obtain\ncreditors\u2019 consent or prior\ncourt review. The insolvency\nand resolution process could\nalso lead to a large\nreduction or total\nelimination of the value of\na BHC\u2019s outstanding equity,\nas well as impairment or\nelimination of certain debt.\n\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d strategy for\nresolving SIFIs, the FDIC\ncould replace a distressed\nBHC with a bridge holding\ncompany, which could\ncontinue operations and\nresult in an orderly\nresolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity is\nheld solely for the benefit\nof creditors of the original\nBHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal\nReserve requires that BHCs\nmaintain minimum levels of\nlong-term debt required to\nprovide adequate loss\nabsorbing capacity in the\nevent of a resolution.\n\nFor more information\nregarding our resolution,\nsee Item 1A.

The Volcker Rule\nalso imposes limits on\nbanking entities\u2019\ninvestments in, and other\nrelationships with, hedge\nfunds and private equity\nfunds. The Volcker Rule\nprovides exemptions for\ncertain activities,\nincluding market making,\nunderwriting, hedging,\ntrading in government\nobligations, insurance\ncompany activities and\norganizing and offering\nhedge funds and private\nequity funds. The Volcker\nRule also clarifies that\ncertain activities are not\nprohibited, including acting\nas agent, broker or\ncustodian. A banking entity\nwith significant trading\noperations, such as the\nCorporation, is required to\nmaintain a detailed\ncompliance program to comply\nwith the restrictions of the\nVolcker Rule.\n                                                         \n  Derivatives                                            \n                                                         \nOur derivatives operations\nare subject to extensive\nregulation globally. These\noperations are subject to\nregulation under the\nFinancial Reform Act, the\nEuropean Union (EU) Markets\nin Financial Instruments\nDirective and Regulation,\nthe European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation,\nanalogous U.K. regulatory\nregimes and similar\nregulatory regimes in other\njurisdictions, that regulate\nor will regulate the\nderivatives markets in which\nwe operate by, among other\nthings: requiring clearing\nand exchange trading of\ncertain derivatives;\nimposing new capital,\nmargin, reporting,\nregistration and business\nconduct requirements for\ncertain market participants;\nimposing position limits on\ncertain\n\nover-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives; and imposing\nderivatives trading\ntransparency requirements.\nRegulations of derivatives\nare already in effect in\nmany markets in which we\noperate.\n\nIn addition, many G-20\njurisdictions, including the\nU.S., U.K., Germany and\nJapan, have adopted\nresolution stay regulations\nto address concerns that the\nclose-out of derivatives and\nother financial contracts in\nresolution could impede\norderly resolution of\nG-SIBs, and additional\njurisdictions are expected\nto follow suit. Generally,\nthese resolution stay\nregulations require\namendment of certain\nfinancial contracts to\nprovide for contractual\nrecognition of stays of\ntermination rights under\nvarious statutory resolution\nregimes and a stay on the\nexercise of cross-default\nrights based on an\naffiliate\u2019s entry into\ninsolvency proceedings. As\nresolution stay regulations\nof a particular jurisdiction\napplicable to us go into\neffect, we amend impacted\nfinancial contracts in\ncompliance with such\nregulations either as a\nregulated entity or as a\ncounterparty facing a\nregulated entity in such\njurisdiction.\n                                                         \n  Consumer Regulations                                   \n                                                         \nOur consumer businesses are\nsubject to extensive\nregulation and oversight by\nfederal and state\nregulators.

The Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act requires us\nto periodically disclose\nBank of America\u2019s privacy\npolicies and practices\nrelating to sharing such\ninformation and enables\nretail customers to opt out\nof our ability to share\ninformation with\nunaffiliated third parties,\nunder certain circumstances.\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nand other laws also require\nus to implement a\ncomprehensive information\nsecurity program that\nincludes administrative,\ntechnical and physical\nsafeguards to provide the\nsecurity and confidentiality\nof customer records and\ninformation.

These negative\neconomic conditions may have\na continued adverse effect\non our businesses and\nresults of operations, which\ncould include: decreased\ndemand for and use of our\nproducts and services;\nprotracted periods of\nhistorically low interest\nrates; lower fees, including\nasset management fees; lower\nsales and trading revenue\ndue to decreased market\nliquidity resulting from\nheightened volatility;\nhigher levels of\nuncollectible reversed\ncharges in our merchant\nservices business; increased\nnoninterest expense,\nincluding operational\nlosses; and increased credit\nlosses due to our customers'\nand clients' inability to\nfulfill contractual\nobligations and\ndeterioration in the\nfinancial condition of our\nconsumer and commercial\nborrowers, which may vary by\nregion, sector or industry,\nthat may increase our\nprovision for credit losses\nand net charge-offs. Our\nprovision for credit losses\nand net charge-offs may also\ncontinue to be impacted by\nvolatility in the energy and\ncommodity markets.\nAdditionally, our liquidity\nand/or regulatory capital\ncould be adversely impacted\nby customers\u2019 withdrawal of\ndeposits, volatility and\ndisruptions in the capital\nand credit markets,\nvolatility in foreign\nexchange rates and customer\ndraws on lines of credit.\nContinued adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions\ncould also result in\npotential downgrades to our\ncredit ratings, negative\nimpacts to regulatory\ncapital and liquidity and\nfurther restrictions on\ndividends and/or common\nstock repurchases.\n\nIf we become unable to\noperate our businesses from\nremote locations including,\nfor example, because of an\ninternal or external failure\nof our information\ntechnology infrastructure,\nwe experience increased\nrates of employee illness or\nunavailability, or\ngovernmental restrictions\nare placed on our employees\nor operations, this could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness continuity status\nand result in disruption to\nour businesses.\nAdditionally, we rely on\nthird parties who could\nexperience adverse effects\non their business continuity\nand business interruptions,\nwhich could increase our\nrisks and adversely impact\nour businesses.\n\nThere can be no assurance\nthat current or future\ngovernmental fiscal and\nmonetary relief programs\nwill stimulate\n\nthe global economy or avert\nnegative economic or market\nconditions. Our\nparticipation in such\nprograms could result in\nreputational harm and\ngovernment actions and\nproceedings, and has\nresulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in,\nlitigation, including class\nactions. Such actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties, and\nfines. Our participation in\nsuch programs has also\nresulted and may continue to\nresult in operational\nlosses, including from the\nPaycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) and processing\nunemployment insurance.\n\nWe continue to closely\nmonitor the pandemic and\nrelated risks as they evolve\nglobally and in the U.S. The\nmagnitude and duration of\nthe pandemic and its future\ndirect and indirect effects\non the global economy and\nour businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition are highly\nuncertain and depend on\nfuture developments that\ncannot be predicted,\nincluding the likelihood of\nfurther surges of COVID-19\ncases and the spread of more\neasily communicable variants\nof COVID-19, the timing and\navailability of effective\nmedical treatments and\nvaccines, future actions\ntaken by governmental\nauthorities, including\nadditional stimulus\nlegislation, and/or other\nthird parties in response to\nthe pandemic. The pandemic\nmay cause prolonged global\nor national negative\neconomic conditions or\nlonger lasting effects on\neconomic conditions than\ncurrently exist, which could\nhave a material adverse\neffect on our businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nMarket\nOur business and results of\noperations may be adversely\naffected by the financial\nmarkets, fiscal, monetary,\nand regulatory policies, and\neconomic conditions\ngenerally.\n\nGeneral economic, political,\nsocial and health conditions\nin the U.S. and in one or\nmore countries abroad affect\nmarkets in the U.S. and\nabroad and our business. In\nparticular, markets in the\nU.S. or abroad may be\naffected by the level and\nvolatility of interest\nrates, availability and\nmarket conditions of\nfinancing, unexpected\nchanges in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), economic\ngrowth or its\nsustainability, inflation,\nconsumer spending,\nemployment levels, wage\nstagnation, federal\ngovernment shutdowns,\ndevelopments related to the\nfederal debt ceiling, energy\nprices, home prices,\nbankruptcies, a default by a\nsignificant market\nparticipant, fluctuations or\nother significant changes in\nboth debt and equity capital\nmarkets and currencies,\nliquidity of the global\nfinancial markets, the\ngrowth of global trade and\ncommerce, trade policies,\nthe availability and cost of\ncapital and credit,\ndisruption of communication,\ntransportation or energy\ninfrastructure and investor\nsentiment and confidence.\nAdditionally, global\nmarkets, including energy\nand commodity markets, may\nbe adversely affected by the\ncurrent or anticipated\nimpact of climate change,\nextreme weather events or\nnatural disasters, the\nemergence of widespread\nhealth emergencies or\npandemics, cyber attacks or\ncampaigns, military\nconflict, terrorism or other\ngeopolitical events. Market\nfluctuations may impact our\nmargin requirements and\naffect our business\nliquidity. Also, any sudden\nor prolonged market downturn\nin the U.S. or abroad, as a\nresult of the above factors\nor otherwise, could result\nin a decline in net interest\nincome and noninterest\nincome and adversely affect\nour results of operations\nand financial condition,\nincluding capital and\nliquidity levels.

Further\nuncertainty and ongoing\ndevelopments in connection\nwith the pandemic, including\nits further spread, changing\nconsumer and business\nbehaviors, government\nrestrictions in an effort to\ncontrol the virus and timing\nand availability of\neffective medical treatments\nand vaccines, could\n                                                         \n  7Bank of America                                       \n                                                         \nresult in further market\nvolatility and disruptions\nglobally and continue to\nadversely impact\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\nActions taken by the Federal\nReserve, including changes\nin its target funds rate,\nbalance sheet management,\nand lending facilities, and\nother central banks are\nbeyond our control and\ndifficult to predict. These\nactions can affect interest\nrates and the value of\nfinancial instruments and\nother assets and\nliabilities, and impact our\nborrowers. The continued\nprotracted period of lower\ninterest rates has resulted\nin lower revenue through\nlower net interest income,\nwhich has adversely affected\nour results of operations.\nAdditional periods of lower\ninterest rates or a move to\nnegative interest rates in\nthe U.S., could have a\nfurther adverse impact on\nour net interest income and\nresults of operations.\nUncertainty or ongoing\ndevelopments in connection\nwith the U.K.\u2019s exit from\nthe EU, and the resulting\nimpact on the financial\nmarkets and regulations in\nrelevant jurisdictions,\ncould negatively impact our\nrevenues and ongoing\noperations in Europe and\nother jurisdictions.\n\nChanges to existing U.S.\nlaws and regulatory\npolicies, including those\nrelated to financial\nregulation, taxation,\ninternational trade, fiscal\npolicy and healthcare, may\nadversely impact U.S. or\nglobal economic activity and\nour customers', our\ncounterparties' and our\nearnings and operations. For\nexample, additional fiscal\nstimulus and rising debt\nlevels, in the U.S. and\nabroad, in response to the\nongoing pandemic could\naffect macroeconomic\nconditions, market liquidity\nconditions, and interest\nrates. Significant fiscal\npolicy changes and/or\ninitiatives, including as a\nresult of the change in the\nU.S. presidential\nadministration and Congress,\nmay also increase\nuncertainty surrounding the\nformulation and direction of\nU.S. monetary policy and\nvolatility of interest\nrates. Higher U.S. interest\nrates relative to other\nmajor economies could\nincrease the likelihood of a\nmore volatile and\nappreciating U.S. dollar.\nChanges, or proposed\nchanges, to certain U.S.\ntrade and international\ninvestment policies,\nparticularly with important\ntrading partners (including\nChina and the EU) have\nnegatively impacted and may\ncontinue to negatively\nimpact financial markets,\ndisrupt world trade and\ncommerce and lead to trade\nretaliation, including\nthrough the use of tariffs,\nforeign exchange measures or\nthe large-scale sale of U.S.\nTreasury Bonds. Further, the\nuse of tariffs among\ncountries not directly\ninvolving the U.S. could\nspread and could damage our\ncustomers directly and\nindirectly.\n\nAny of these developments\ncould adversely affect our\nconsumer and commercial\nbusinesses, our customers,\nour securities and\nderivatives portfolios,\nincluding the risk of lower\nre-investment rates within\nthose portfolios, our level\nof charge-offs and provision\nfor credit losses, the\ncarrying value of our\ndeferred tax assets, our\ncapital levels, our\nliquidity and our results of\noperations. Additionally,\nthe uncertainty related to\nthe transition from\nInterbank Offered Rates\n(IBORs) and other benchmark\nrates to alternative\nreference rates (ARRs) could\nnegatively impact markets\nglobally and our business,\nand/or magnify any negative\nimpact of the above\nreferenced factors on our\nbusiness, customers and\nresults of operations.\n\nIncreased market volatility\nand adverse changes in\nfinancial or capital market\nconditions may increase our\nmarket risk.\n\nOur liquidity, competitive\nposition, business, results\nof operations and financial\ncondition are affected by\nmarket risks such as changes\nin interest and currency\nexchange rates, fluctuations\nin equity and futures\nprices, lower trading\nvolumes and prices of\nsecuritized products, the\nimplied volatility of\ninterest rates and credit\nspreads and other economic\nand business factors. These\nmarket risks may adversely\naffect, among other things,\nthe value of our on- and\noff-balance sheet\n\nsecurities, trading assets\nand other financial\ninstruments, the cost of\ndebt capital and our access\nto credit markets, the value\nof assets under management\n(AUM), fee income relating\nto AUM, customer allocation\nof capital among investment\nalternatives, the volume of\nclient activity in our\ntrading operations,\ninvestment banking fees, the\ngeneral profitability and\nrisk level of the\ntransactions in which we\nengage and our\ncompetitiveness with respect\nto deposit pricing. For\nexample, the value of\ncertain of our assets is\nsensitive to changes in\nmarket interest rates. If\nthe Federal Reserve or a\nnon-U.S. central bank\nchanges or signals a change\nin monetary policy, market\ninterest rates could be\naffected, which could\nadversely impact the value\nof such assets. Changes to\nfiscal policy, including\nrapid expansion of U.S.\nfederal deficit spending and\nresultant debt issuance,\ncould also affect market\ninterest rates. In addition,\nthe low interest rate\nenvironment and a flat or\ninverted yield curve has had\nand could continue to have a\nnegative impact on our\nresults of operations,\nincluding on future revenue\nand earnings growth.\n\nWe use various models and\nstrategies to assess and\ncontrol our market risk\nexposures, but those are\nsubject to inherent\nlimitations. In times of\nmarket stress or other\nunforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated\nindicators may become\ncorrelated and vice versa.\nThese types of market\nmovements may limit the\neffectiveness of our hedging\nstrategies and cause us to\nincur significant losses.\nThese changes in correlation\ncan be exacerbated where\nother market participants\nare using risk or trading\nmodels with assumptions or\nalgorithms similar to ours.\nIn these and other cases, it\nmay be difficult to reduce\nour risk positions due to\nactivity of other market\nparticipants or widespread\nmarket dislocations,\nincluding circumstances\nwhere asset values are\ndeclining significantly or\nno market exists for certain\nassets. To the extent that\nwe own securities that do\nnot have an established\nliquid trading market or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sale or\nhedging, we may not be able\nto reduce our positions and\ntherefore reduce our risk\nassociated with such\npositions.\n\nWe may incur losses if the\nvalue of assets decline,\nincluding due to changes in\ninterest rates and\nprepayment speeds.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding loans and loan\ncommitments, securities\nfinancing agreements, asset-\nbacked secured financings,\nderivative assets and\nliabilities, debt\nsecurities, marketable\nequity securities and\ncertain other assets and\nliabilities that we measure\nat fair value that are\nsubject to valuation and\nimpairment assessments. We\ndetermine these values based\non applicable accounting\nguidance, which for\nfinancial instruments\nmeasured at fair value,\nrequires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price and\nto maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and\nminimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in fair\nvalue measurements. The fair\nvalues of these financial\ninstruments include\nadjustments for market\nliquidity, credit quality,\nfunding impact on certain\nderivatives and other\ntransaction-specific\nfactors, where appropriate.\n\nGains or losses on these\ninstruments can have a\ndirect impact on our results\nof operations, unless we\nhave effectively hedged our\nexposures. Increases in\ninterest rates may result in\na decrease in residential\nmortgage loan originations.\nIn addition, increases in\ninterest rates may adversely\nimpact the fair value of\ndebt securities and,\naccordingly, for debt\nsecurities classified as\navailable for sale, may\nadversely affect accumulated\nother comprehensive income\nand, thus, capital levels.\nDecreases in interest rates\nmay increase prepayment\nspeeds of certain assets,\nand therefore may adversely\naffect net interest income.\n\nFair values may be impacted\nby declining values of the\nunderlying assets or the\nprices at which observable\nmarket\n                                                         \n  Bank of America8                                       \n                                                         \ntransactions occur and the\ncontinued availability of\nthese transactions or\nindices. The financial\nstrength of counterparties,\nwith whom we have\neconomically hedged some of\nour exposure to these\nassets, also will affect the\nfair value of these assets.\nSudden declines and\nvolatility in the prices of\nassets may curtail or\neliminate trading activities\nin these assets, which may\nmake it difficult to sell,\nhedge or value these assets.\nThe inability to sell or\neffectively hedge assets\nreduces our ability to limit\nlosses in such positions and\nthe difficulty in valuing\nassets may increase our\nrisk-weighted assets (RWA),\nwhich requires us to\nmaintain additional capital\nand increases our funding\ncosts. Values of AUM also\nimpact revenues in our\nwealth management and\nrelated advisory businesses\nfor asset-based management\nand performance fees.\nDeclines in values of AUM\ncan result in lower fees\nearned for managing such\nassets.\n                                                         \n   Liquidity                                             \n                                                         \nIf we are unable to access\nthe capital markets or\ncontinue to maintain\ndeposits, or our borrowing\ncosts increase, our\nliquidity and competitive\nposition will be negatively\naffected.\n\nLiquidity is essential to\nour businesses. We fund our\nassets primarily with\nglobally sourced deposits in\nour bank entities, as well\nas secured and unsecured\nliabilities transacted in\nthe capital markets. We rely\non certain secured funding\nsources, such as repo\nmarkets, which are typically\nshort-term and credit-\nsensitive in nature. We also\nengage in asset\nsecuritization transactions,\nincluding with the\ngovernment-sponsored\nenterprises (GSEs), to fund\nconsumer lending activities.\nOur liquidity could be\nadversely affected by any\ninability to access the\ncapital markets, illiquidity\nor volatility in the capital\nmarkets, the decrease in\nvalue of eligible collateral\nor increased collateral\nrequirements (including as a\nresult of credit concerns\nfor short-term borrowing),\nchanges to our relationships\nwith our funding providers\nbased on real or perceived\nchanges in our risk profile,\nprolonged federal government\nshutdowns, or changes in\nregulations, guidance or GSE\nstatus that impact our\nfunding avenues or ability\nto access certain funding\nsources. Additionally, our\nliquidity may be negatively\nimpacted by the\nunwillingness or inability\nof the Federal Reserve to\nact as lender of last\nresort, unexpected\nsimultaneous draws on lines\nof credit, slower customer\npayment rates, restricted\naccess to the assets of\nprime brokerage clients, the\nwithdrawal of or failure to\nattract customer deposits or\ninvested funds (which could\nresult from customer\nattrition for higher yields,\nthe desire for more\nconservative alternatives or\nour customers\u2019 increased\nneed for cash), increased\nregulatory liquidity,\ncapital and margin\nrequirements for our U.S. or\ninternational banks and\ntheir nonbank subsidiaries,\nchanges in patterns of\nintraday liquidity usage\nresulting from a\ncounterparty or technology\nfailure or other\nidiosyncratic event or\nfailure or default by a\nsignificant market\nparticipant or third party\n(including clearing agents,\ncustodians or central\ncounterparties (CCPs)).\nThese factors also have the\npotential to increase our\nborrowing costs.\n\nSeveral of these factors may\narise due to circumstances\nbeyond our control, such as\ngeneral market volatility,\ndisruption, shock or stress,\nthe emergence of widespread\nhealth emergencies or\npandemics, Federal Reserve\npolicy decisions (including\nfluctuations in interest\nrates or Federal Reserve\nbalance sheet composition),\nnegative views about the\nCorporation (including\nshort- and long-term\nbusiness prospects) or the\nfinancial services industry\ngenerally or due to a\nspecific news event, changes\nin the regulatory\nenvironment or governmental\nfiscal or monetary policies\n(including as a result of\nthe change in the U.S.\npresidential administration\nand Congress), actions by\ncredit rating agencies or an\noperational\n\nproblem that affects third\nparties or us. The impact of\nthese events, whether within\nour control or not, could\ninclude an inability to sell\nassets or redeem\ninvestments, unforeseen\noutflows of cash, the need\nto draw on liquidity\nfacilities, the reduction of\nfinancing balances and the\nloss of equity secured\nfunding, debt repurchases to\nsupport the secondary market\nor meet client requests, the\nneed for additional funding\nfor commitments and\ncontingencies and unexpected\ncollateral calls, among\nother things, the result of\nwhich could be increased\ncosts, a liquidity shortfall\nand/or impact on our\nliquidity coverage ratio.\n\nOur liquidity and cost of\nobtaining funding is\ndirectly related to\nprevailing market\nconditions, including\nchanges in interest and\ncurrency exchange rates,\nfluctuations in equity and\nfutures prices, lower\ntrading volumes and prices\nof securitized products and\nour credit spreads. Credit\nspreads are the amount in\nexcess of the interest rate\nof U.S. Treasury securities,\nor other benchmark\nsecurities, of a similar\nmaturity that we need to pay\nto our funding providers.\nIncreases in interest rates\nand our credit spreads can\nincrease the cost of our\nfunding and result in mark-\nto-market or credit\nvaluation adjustment\nexposures. Changes in our\ncredit spreads are market-\ndriven and may be influenced\nby market perceptions of our\ncreditworthiness. Changes to\ninterest rates and our\ncredit spreads occur\ncontinuously and may be\nunpredictable and highly\nvolatile. We may also\nexperience spread\ncompression as a result of\noffering higher than\nexpected deposit rates in\norder to attract and\nmaintain deposits due to\nincreased marketplace rate\ncompetition. Additionally,\nconcentrations within our\nfunding profile, such as\nmaturities, currencies or\ncounterparties, can reduce\nour funding efficiency.\n\nReduction in our credit\nratings could significantly\nlimit our access to funding\nor the capital markets,\nincrease borrowing costs or\ntrigger additional\ncollateral or funding\nrequirements.\n\nOur borrowing costs and\nability to raise funds are\ndirectly impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition,\ncredit ratings may be\nimportant to customers or\ncounterparties when we\ncompete in certain markets\nand seek to engage in\ncertain transactions,\nincluding OTC derivatives.\nCredit ratings and outlooks\nare opinions expressed by\nrating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of\nour obligations or\nsecurities, including long-\nterm debt, short-term\nborrowings, preferred stock\nand asset securitizations.\nOur credit ratings are\nsubject to ongoing review by\nrating agencies, which\nconsider a number of\nfactors, including our\nfinancial strength,\nperformance, prospects and\noperations and factors not\nunder our control, such as\nthe macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical environment,\nincluding the macroeconomic\nstress caused by the\npandemic.\n\nRating agencies could make\nadjustments to our credit\nratings at any time, and\nthere can be no assurance as\nto when and whether\ndowngrades will occur. A\nreduction in certain of our\ncredit ratings could result\nin a wider credit spread and\nnegatively affect our\nliquidity, access to credit\nmarkets, the related cost of\nfunds, our businesses and\ncertain trading revenues,\nparticularly in those\nbusinesses where\ncounterparty\ncreditworthiness is\ncritical. If the short-term\ncredit ratings of our parent\ncompany, or bank or broker-\ndealer subsidiaries, were\ndowngraded by one or more\nlevels, we may suffer the\npotential loss of access to\nshort-term funding sources\nsuch as repo financing,\nand/or incur increased cost\nof funds and increased\ncollateral requirements.\nUnder the terms of certain\nOTC derivative contracts and\nother trading agreements, if\nour or our subsidiaries\u2019\ncredit ratings are\ndowngraded, the\ncounterparties may require\nadditional collateral or\nterminate these contracts or\nagreements.\n                                                         \n  9Bank of America                                       \n                                                         \nWhile certain potential\nimpacts are contractual and\nquantifiable, the full\nconsequences of a credit\nrating downgrade to a\nfinancial institution are\ninherently uncertain, as\nthey depend upon numerous\ndynamic, complex and inter-\nrelated factors and\nassumptions, including\nwhether any downgrade of a\nfirm\u2019s long-term credit\nratings precipitates\ndowngrades to its short-term\ncredit ratings, and\nassumptions about the\npotential behaviors of\nvarious customers, investors\nand counterparties.\n\nBank of America Corporation\nis a holding company, is\ndependent on its\nsubsidiaries for liquidity\nand may be restricted from\ntransferring funds from\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America Corporation,\nas the parent company, is a\nseparate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries. We\nevaluate and manage\nliquidity on a legal entity\nbasis. Legal entity\nliquidity is an important\nconsideration as there are\nlegal, regulatory,\ncontractual and other\nlimitations on our ability\nto utilize liquidity from\none legal entity to satisfy\nthe liquidity requirements\nof another, including the\nparent company, which could\nresult in adverse liquidity\nevents. The parent company\ndepends on dividends,\ndistributions, loans and\nother payments from our bank\nand nonbank subsidiaries to\nfund dividend payments on\nour common stock and\npreferred stock and to fund\nall payments on our other\nobligations, including debt\nobligations. Any inability\nof our subsidiaries to pay\ndividends or make payments\nto us may adversely affect\nour cash flow and financial\ncondition.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries,\nincluding our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nare subject to laws that\nrestrict dividend payments,\nor authorize regulatory\nbodies to block or reduce\nthe flow of funds from those\nsubsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other\nsubsidiaries. Our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions\non their ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates and\nto minimum regulatory\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, as well as\nrestrictions on their\nability to use funds\ndeposited with them in bank\nor brokerage accounts to\nfund their businesses.\nIntercompany arrangements we\nentered into in connection\nwith our resolution planning\nsubmissions could restrict\nthe amount of funding\navailable to the parent\ncompany from our\nsubsidiaries under certain\nadverse conditions.\n\nAdditional restrictions on\nrelated party transactions,\nincreased capital and\nliquidity requirements and\nadditional limitations on\nthe use of funds on deposit\nin bank or brokerage\naccounts, as well as lower\nearnings, can reduce the\namount of funds available to\nmeet the obligations of the\nparent company and even\nrequire the parent company\nto provide additional\nfunding to such\nsubsidiaries. Also,\nregulatory action that\nrequires additional\nliquidity at each of our\nsubsidiaries could impede\naccess to funds we need to\npay our obligations or pay\ndividends. In addition, our\nright to participate in a\ndistribution of assets upon\na subsidiary\u2019s liquidation\nor reorganization is subject\nto prior claims of the\nsubsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\nOur liquidity and financial\ncondition, and the ability\nto pay dividends to\nshareholders and to pay\nobligations could be\nmaterially adversely\naffected in the event of a\nresolution.\n\nBank of America Corporation,\nour parent holding company,\nis required to periodically\nsubmit a plan to the FDIC\nand Federal Reserve\ndescribing its resolution\nstrategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event\nof material financial\ndistress or failure. In the\ncurrent plan, Bank of\nAmerica Corporation\u2019s\npreferred resolution\nstrategy is a \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy. This\nstrategy provides that only\nthe parent holding company\nfiles for resolution under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code and\ncontemplates providing\ncertain key operating\nsubsidiaries with sufficient\ncapital and liquidity to\noperate through severe\nstress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue\noperating or be wound\n\ndown in a solvent manner\nfollowing a bankruptcy of\nthe parent holding company.\nBank of America Corporation\nhas entered into\nintercompany arrangements\nresulting in the\ncontribution of most of its\ncapital and liquidity to key\nsubsidiaries. Pursuant to\nthese arrangements, if Bank\nof America Corporation\u2019s\nliquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that\nresolution becomes imminent,\nBank of America Corporation\nwill no longer be able to\ndraw liquidity from its key\nsubsidiaries, and will be\nrequired to contribute its\nremaining financial assets\nto a wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary, which\ncould materially and\nadversely affect our\nliquidity and financial\ncondition and the ability to\nreturn capital to\nshareholders, including\nthrough the payment of\ndividends and repurchase of\nthe Corporation\u2019s common\nstock, and meet our payment\nobligations.\n\nIf the FDIC and Federal\nReserve jointly determine\nthat Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s resolution\nplan is not credible, they\ncould impose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on our growth,\nactivities or operations. We\ncould also be required to\ntake certain actions that\ncould impose operating costs\nand could potentially result\nin the divestiture or\nrestructuring of businesses\nand subsidiaries.\n\nAdditionally, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nG-SIB such as Bank of\nAmerica Corporation is in\ndefault or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be\nappointed receiver in order\nto conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such\ninstitution. In the event of\nsuch appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things,\ninvoke the orderly\nliquidation authority,\ninstead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury\nmakes certain financial\ndistress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. In 2013, the\nFDIC issued a notice\ndescribing its preferred\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy for resolving a\nG-SIB. Under this approach,\nthe FDIC could replace Bank\nof America Corporation with\na bridge holding company,\nwhich could continue\noperations and result in an\norderly resolution of the\nunderlying bank, but whose\nequity would be held solely\nfor the benefit of our\ncreditors. The FDIC\u2019s\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy may result in our\nsecurity holders suffering\ngreater losses than would\nhave been the case under a\nbankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy.\n\nCredit\n\nEconomic or market\ndisruptions and insufficient\ncredit loss reserves may\nresult in a higher provision\nfor credit losses.\n\nA number of our products\nexpose us to credit risk,\nincluding loans, letters of\ncredit, derivatives, debt\nsecurities, trading account\nassets and assets held-for-\nsale. Deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of our\nconsumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or\nunderlying collateral could\nadversely affect our\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur credit portfolios may be\nimpacted by global and U.S.\nmacroeconomic and market\nconditions, events and\ndisruptions, including\nsustained weakness in GDP,\nconsumer-spending declines,\nproperty value declines or\nasset-price corrections,\nincreasing consumer and\ncorporate leverage,\nincreases in corporate bond\nspreads, rising or elevated\nunemployment levels,\nfluctuations in foreign\nexchange or interest rates,\nwidespread health\nemergencies or pandemics,\nextreme weather events and\nthe impacts of climate\nchange and domestic and\nglobal efforts to transition\nto a low-carbon economy.\nSignificant economic or\nmarket stresses and\ndisruptions typically have a\nnegative impact on the\nbusiness environment and\nfinancial markets. Property\nvalue declines or asset-\nprice corrections could\nincrease the risk of\nborrowers or counterparties\ndefaulting or becoming\ndelinquent in their\nobligations to us, which\ncould increase credit\nlosses. Simultaneous\ndrawdowns on lines of credit\nand/or an increase in a\nborrower\u2019s leverage in a\n                                                         \n  Bank of America10                                      \n                                                         \nweakening economic\nenvironment could result in\ndeterioration in our credit\nportfolio, should borrowers\nbe unable to fulfill\ncompeting financial\nobligations. Credit\nportfolio deterioration\ncould also be magnified by\nlending to leveraged\nborrowers, elevated asset\nprices or declining property\nor collateral values\nunrelated to macroeconomic\nstress. Increased\ndelinquency and default\nrates could adversely affect\nour consumer credit card,\nhome equity and residential\nmortgage portfolios through\nincreased charge-offs and\nprovision for credit losses.\n\nBeginning in the first\nquarter of 2020, the\npandemic resulted in changes\nto consumer and business\nbehaviors and restrictions\non economic activity, which\nhave negatively impacted the\nglobal economy and could\ncontinue to negatively\nimpact our consumer and\ncommercial credit\nportfolios. Accordingly, we\nincreased our allowance for\ncredit losses as a result of\nthe expected macroeconomic\nimpact of COVID-19, which\nhas adversely affected our\nresults of operations.\nAlthough the economy,\nincluding GDP, and\nunemployment have improved\nsince the first half of\n2020, certain sectors remain\nsignificantly impacted\n(e.g., hospitality,\nentertainment and travel).\nAs COVID-19 cases have\nsurged in the fourth quarter\nof 2020 and early 2021,\ncompared to earlier levels,\nand restrictions on economic\nactivity have been\nreintroduced in certain\ngeographies, there remains\nsignificant uncertainty on\nwhat the ultimate impact the\npandemic will have on the\neconomy and our allowance\nfor credit losses.\n\nWe establish an allowance\nfor credit losses, which\nincludes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, based\non management's best\nestimate of lifetime\nexpected credit losses\ninherent in the\nCorporation's relevant\nfinancial assets. The\nprocess to determine the\nallowance requires us to\nmake difficult and complex\njudgments, including\nforecasting how borrowers\nwill perform in changing and\nunprecedented economic\nconditions and predicting\ndevelopments in public\nhealth and fiscal policy\nrelated to the pandemic. The\nability of our borrowers or\ncounterparties to repay\ntheir obligations will\nlikely be impacted by\nchanges in future economic\nconditions, which in turn\ncould impact the accuracy of\nour loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates. There\nis also the possibility that\nwe have failed or will fail\nto accurately identify the\nappropriate economic\nindicators or accurately\nestimate their impacts to\nour borrowers, which\nsimilarly could impact the\naccuracy of our loss\nforecasts and allowance\nestimates.\n\nWe may suffer unexpected\nlosses if the models and\nassumptions we use to\nestablish reserves or the\njudgments we make in\nextending credit to our\nborrowers or counterparties,\nwhich are more sensitive due\nto the uncertainty regarding\nthe magnitude and duration\nof the pandemic and related\nmacroeconomic impact, prove\ninaccurate in predicting\nfuture events. In addition,\nchanges to external factors\ncan negatively impact our\nrecognition of credit losses\nin our portfolios and\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, we\nimplemented a new accounting\nstandard to estimate our\nallowance for credit losses.\nAlthough we believe that the\nallowance for credit losses\nis in compliance with the\nnew accounting standard,\nthere is no guarantee that\nit will be sufficient to\naddress credit losses,\nparticularly if the economic\noutlook deteriorates\nsignificantly. In such an\nevent, we may increase our\nallowance which would reduce\nour earnings. Additionally,\nto the extent that economic\nconditions worsen as a\nresult of COVID-19 or\notherwise, impacting our\nconsumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or\nunderlying collateral, and\ncredit losses are worse than\nexpected, we may further\nincrease our provision for\ncredit losses, which\n\ncould have a further adverse\neffect on our results of\noperations and could\nnegatively impact our\nfinancial condition.\n\nOur concentrations of credit\nrisk could adversely affect\nour credit losses, results\nof operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nIn the ordinary course of\nour business, we may be\nsubject to concentrations of\ncredit risk because of a\ncommon characteristic or\ncommon sensitivity to\neconomic, financial, public\nhealth or business\ndevelopments. For example,\nconcentrations in credit\nrisk may result in a\nparticular industry,\ngeography, product, asset\nclass, counterparty,\nindividual exposure or\nwithin any pool of exposures\nwith a common risk\ncharacteristic. A\ndeterioration in the\nfinancial condition or\nprospects of a particular\nindustry, geographic\nlocation, product or asset\nclass, or a failure or\ndowngrade of, or default by,\nany particular entity or\ngroup of entities could\nnegatively affect our\nbusinesses, and it is\npossible our limits and\ncredit monitoring exposure\ncontrols will not function\nas anticipated.\n\nWhile our activities expose\nus to many different\nindustries and\ncounterparties, we routinely\nexecute a high volume of\ntransactions with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding broker-dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment\nbanks, insurers, mutual\nfunds and hedge funds,\ncentral counterparties and\nother institutional clients,\nresulting in significant\ncredit concentration with\nrespect to this industry.\nFinancial services\ninstitutions and other\ncounterparties are inter-\nrelated because of trading,\nfunding, clearing or other\nrelationships. As a result,\ndefaults by one or more\ncounterparties, or market\nuncertainty about the\nfinancial stability of one\nor more financial services\ninstitutions, or the\nfinancial services industry\ngenerally, could lead to\nmarket-wide liquidity\ndisruptions, losses and\ndefaults.\n\nMany of these transactions\nexpose us to credit risk\nand, in some cases, disputes\nand litigation in the event\nof default of a\ncounterparty. In addition,\nour credit risk may be\nheightened by market risk\nwhen the collateral held by\nus cannot be liquidated or\nis liquidated at prices not\nsufficient to recover the\nfull amount of the loan or\nderivatives exposure due to\nus, which may occur as a\nresult of fraud or other\nevents that impact the value\nof the collateral. Further,\ndisputes with obligors as to\nthe valuation of collateral\ncould increase in times of\nsignificant market stress,\nvolatility or illiquidity,\nand we could suffer losses\nduring such periods if we\nare unable to realize the\nfair value of the collateral\nor manage declines in the\nvalue of collateral.\n\nOur commercial portfolios\ninclude exposures to certain\nindustries, including asset\nmanagers and funds, real\nestate, capital goods and\nfinance companies. Economic\nweaknesses, adverse business\nconditions, market\ndisruptions, rising interest\nor capitalization rates, the\ncollapse of speculative\nbubbles, greater volatility\nin areas where we have\nconcentrated credit risk or\ndeterioration in real estate\nvalues or household incomes\nmay cause us to experience a\ndecrease in cash flow and\nhigher credit losses in\neither our consumer or\ncommercial portfolios or\ncause us to write down the\nvalue of certain assets.\nAdditionally, we could\nexperience continued and\nlong-term negative impact to\nour commercial credit\nexposure and an increase in\ncredit losses within those\nindustries that continue to\nbe disproportionately\nimpacted by COVID-19 or are\npermanently impacted by a\nchange in consumer\npreferences resulting from\nCOVID-19 (including\nhospitality, entertainment\nand travel).\n\nFurthermore, we have\nconcentrations of credit\nrisk with respect to our\nconsumer real estate, auto,\nconsumer credit card and\ncommercial real estate\nportfolios, which represent\na significant percentage of\nour overall credit\nportfolio. Decreases in home\nprice valuations or\ncommercial real estate\nvaluations in certain\nmarkets where we have large\nconcentrations, as well as\n                                                         \n  11Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nmore broadly within the U.S.\nor globally, could result in\nincreased defaults,\ndelinquencies or credit\nloss. In particular, the\nimpact of climate change,\nsuch as rising average\nglobal temperatures and\nrising sea levels, and the\nincreasing frequency and\nseverity of extreme weather\nevents and natural disasters\nsuch as droughts, floods,\nwildfires and hurricanes\ncould negatively impact\ncollateral, the valuations\nof home prices or commercial\nreal estate or our\ncustomers\u2019 ability and/or\nwillingness to pay\noutstanding loans. This\ncould also cause\ninsurability risk and/or\nincreased insurance costs to\ncustomers.\n\nWe also enter into\ntransactions with sovereign\nnations, U.S. states and\nmunicipalities. Unfavorable\neconomic or political\nconditions, disruptions to\ncapital markets, currency\nfluctuations, changes in oil\nprices, social instability\nand changes in government or\nmonetary policies could\nadversely impact the\noperating budgets or credit\nratings of these government\nentities and expose us to\ncredit risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may result\nin our inability to sell,\nsyndicate or realize the\nvalue of our positions,\nleading to increased\nconcentrations, which could\nincrease the credit and\nmarket risk associated with\nour positions, as well as\nincrease our RWA.\n\nWe may be adversely affected\nif the U.S. housing market\nweakens or home prices\ndecline.\n\nU.S. home prices continued\nto generally remain stable\nor increase in 2020,\nsupported by single-family\nhousing demand and low\ninterest rates. However,\nchanges in business and\nhousehold behaviors and\nrestrictions on activity in\nresponse to the pandemic\nhave had a negative impact\non some property markets,\nparticularly in high-density\nurban areas. We remain\nconscious of geographic\nmarkets where housing price\ngrowth has slowed or\ndecreased, or is vulnerable\nto lasting shifts in demand\ndue to the pandemic, as\nfurther declines in future\nperiods may negatively\nimpact the demand for many\nof our products.\nAdditionally, our mortgage\nloan production volume is\ngenerally influenced by the\nrate of growth in\nresidential mortgage debt\noutstanding and the size of\nthe residential mortgage\nmarket, both of which may be\nadversely affected by rising\ninterest rates. Conditions\nin the U.S. housing market\nduring the 2008 financial\ncrisis resulted in both\nsignificant write-downs of\nasset values in several\nasset classes, notably\nmortgage-backed securities,\nand exposure to monolines.\nIf the U.S. housing market\nwere to weaken, the value of\nreal estate could decline,\nwhich could result in\nincreased credit losses and\ndelinquent servicing\nexpenses and negatively\naffect our representations\nand warranties exposures,\nand adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur derivatives businesses\nmay expose us to unexpected\nrisks and potential losses.\n\nWe are party to a large\nnumber of derivatives\ntransactions that may expose\nus to unexpected market,\ncredit and operational risks\nthat could cause us to\nsuffer unexpected losses.\nSevere declines in asset\nvalues, unanticipated credit\nevents or unforeseen\ncircumstances that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated\nfactors to become correlated\nand vice versa, may create\nlosses resulting from risks\nnot appropriately taken into\naccount or anticipated in\nthe development, structuring\nor pricing of a derivative\ninstrument. Certain OTC\nderivative contracts and\nother trading agreements\nprovide that upon the\noccurrence of certain\nspecified events, such as a\nchange in the credit rating\nof the Corporation or one or\nmore of its affiliates, we\nmay be required to provide\nadditional collateral or\ntake other remedial actions\nand could experience\nincreased difficulty\nobtaining funding or hedging\nrisks. In some cases our\ncounterparties may have the\nright to terminate or\notherwise diminish our\nrights under these contracts\nor agreements.\n\nWe are also a member of\nvarious central\ncounterparties (CCPs), in\npart due to regulatory\nrequirements for mandatory\nclearing of derivative\ntransactions, which\npotentially increases our\ncredit risk exposures to\nCCPs. In the event that one\nor more members of the CCP\ndefaults on its obligations,\nwe may be required to pay a\nportion of any losses\nincurred by the CCP as a\nresult of that default. A\nCCP may modify, in its\ndiscretion, the margin we\nare required to post, which\ncould mean unexpected and\nincreased exposure to the\nCCP. As a clearing member,\nwe are exposed to the risk\nof non-performance by our\nclients for which we clear\ntransactions, which may not\nbe covered by available\ncollateral. Additionally,\ndefault by a significant\nmarket participant may\nresult in further risk and\npotential losses.\n                                                         \n  Geopolitical                                           \n                                                         \nWe are subject to numerous\npolitical, economic, market,\nreputational, operational,\nlegal, regulatory and other\nrisks in the jurisdictions\nin which we operate.\n\nWe do business throughout\nthe world, including in\nemerging markets. Economic\nor geopolitical stress in\none or more countries could\nhave a negative impact\nregionally or globally,\nresulting in, among other\nthings, market volatility,\nreduced market value and\neconomic output. Our\nbusinesses and revenues\nderived from non-U.S.\njurisdictions are subject to\nrisk of loss from currency\nfluctuations, financial,\nsocial or judicial\ninstability, changes in\ngovernment leadership,\nincluding as a result of\nelectoral outcomes or\notherwise, changes in\ngovernmental policies or\npolicies of central banks,\nexpropriation,\nnationalization and/or\nconfiscation of assets,\nprice controls, high\ninflation, natural\ndisasters, the emergence of\nwidespread health\nemergencies or pandemics,\ncapital controls, currency\nredenomination risk,\nexchange controls,\nunfavorable political and\ndiplomatic developments, oil\nprice fluctuations and\nchanges in legislation.\nThese risks are especially\nelevated in emerging\nmarkets. Additionally,\nprotectionist trade policies\nand continued trade tensions\nbetween the U.S. and\nimportant trading partners,\nparticularly China and the\nEU, including the risk that\ntariffs continue to rise and\nother restrictive actions on\ncross-border trade,\ninvestment, and transfer of\ninformation technology are\ntaken that weigh heavily on\nregional trade volumes and\ndomestic demand through\nfalling business sentiment\nand lower consumer\nconfidence, could adversely\naffect our businesses and\nrevenues, as well as our\ncustomers and\ncounterparties. Elevated\ntensions between the U.S.\nand China also raise the\nrisk that current or future\nU.S. sanctions against\nindividuals or export\ncontrols targeting Chinese\nfirms could prompt\nretaliatory responses,\npotentially impacting our\noperations and revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the\nrealization of any\nsignificant geopolitical\nevents, negative market\nconditions and/or change in\nmarket dynamics as a result\nof the U.K.\u2019s exit from the\nEU could adversely impact\nour businesses. The short-\nand long-term impact of the\nU.K.\u2019s exit from the EU on\nEuropean and global\nmacroeconomic conditions,\nour business operations and\nresults of operations remain\nunknown.\n\nA number of non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which we do\nbusiness have been or may be\nnegatively impacted by\nslowing growth or\nrecessionary conditions,\nmarket volatility and/or\npolitical or civil unrest.\nThe ongoing pandemic has had\na severe negative impact on\nglobal GDP, and the global\neconomic environment remains\nchallenging even as output\nhas begun to improve.\nEconomic weakness may prove\npersistent in many countries\nand regions, including\nEurope, Japan, and numerous\nemerging markets. Potential\nrisks of default on or\ndevaluation of sovereign\ndebt in some non-U.S.\njurisdictions could expose\nus to substantial losses. As\na result of the pandemic and\nfiscal policy responses\n                                                         \n  Bank of America12                                      \n                                                         \nto it, government debt\nlevels have increased\nsignificantly, raising the\nrisk of volatility,\nsignificant valuation\nchanges, or default in\nmarkets for sovereign debt.\nRisks in one nation can\nlimit our opportunities for\nportfolio growth and\nnegatively affect our\noperations in other nations,\nincluding our U.S.\noperations. Market and\neconomic disruptions of all\ntypes may affect consumer\nconfidence levels and\nspending, corporate\ninvestment and job creation,\nbankruptcy rates, levels of\nincurrence and default on\nconsumer and corporate debt,\neconomic growth rates and\nasset values, among other\nfactors. Any such\nunfavorable conditions or\ndevelopments could adversely\nimpact us.\n\nWe also invest or trade in\nthe securities of\ncorporations and governments\nlocated in non-U.S.\njurisdictions, including\nemerging markets. Revenues\nfrom the trading of non-U.S.\nsecurities may be subject to\nnegative fluctuations as a\nresult of the above factors.\nFurthermore, the impact of\nthese fluctuations could be\nmagnified because non-U.S.\ntrading markets,\nparticularly in emerging\nmarkets, are generally\nsmaller, less liquid and\nmore volatile than U.S.\ntrading markets.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are\nalso subject to extensive\nregulation by governments,\nsecurities exchanges and\nregulators, central banks\nand other regulatory bodies.\nIn many countries, the laws\nand regulations applicable\nto the financial services\nand securities industries\nare uncertain and evolving,\nand it may be difficult for\nus to determine the exact\nrequirements of local laws\nin every market or manage\nour relationships with\nmultiple regulators in\nvarious jurisdictions. Our\npotential inability to\nremain in compliance with\nlocal laws in a particular\nmarket and manage our\nrelationships with\nregulators could result in\nincreased expenses and\nchanges to our\norganizational structure and\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and results of\noperations in that market,\nas well as our reputation in\ngeneral.\n\nIn connection with the\nU.K.\u2019s exit from the EU, we\nare now subject to different\nlaws, regulations and\nregulatory authorities and\nincreased organizational and\noperational complexity. We\nmay incur additional costs\nand/or experience negative\ntax consequences as a result\nof operating our principal\nEU banking and broker-dealer\noperations outside of the\nU.K., which could adversely\nimpact our EU business,\nresults of operations and\noperational model. Further,\nchanges to the legal and\nregulatory framework under\nwhich our subsidiaries\nprovide products and\nservices in the U.K. and in\nthe EU may result in\nadditional compliance costs\nand have negative tax\nconsequences or an adverse\nimpact on our results of\noperations.\n\nIn addition to non-U.S.\nlegislation, our\ninternational operations are\nalso subject to U.S. legal\nrequirements, which subjects\nus to operational and\ncompliance costs and risks.\nFor example, our operations\nare subject to U.S. and\nnon-U.S. laws and\nregulations relating to\nbribery and corruption,\nanti-money laundering, and\neconomic sanctions, which\ncan vary by jurisdiction.\nThe increasing speed and\nnovel ways in which funds\ncirculate could make it more\nchallenging to track the\nmovement of funds and\nheightens financial crimes\nrisk. Our ability to comply\nwith these legal\nrequirements depends on our\nability to continually\nimprove surveillance,\ndetection and reporting and\nanalytic capabilities.\n\nIn the U.S., debt ceiling\nand budget deficit concerns,\nwhich have increased the\npossibility of U.S.\ngovernment defaults on its\ndebt and/or downgrades to\nits credit ratings, and\nprolonged government\nshutdowns could negatively\nimpact the global economy\nand banking system and\nadversely affect our\nfinancial condition,\nincluding our liquidity.\nAdditionally, changes in\nfiscal, monetary or\nregulatory policy, including\nas a result of the change in\nthe U.S. presidential\nadministration and Congress,\ncould increase our\ncompliance costs and\nadversely affect our\n\nbusiness operations,\norganizational structure and\nresults of operations. We\nare also subject to\ngeopolitical risks,\nincluding economic\nsanctions, acts or threats\nof international or domestic\nterrorism, actions taken by\nthe U.S. or other\ngovernments in response\nthereto, state-sponsored\ncyber attacks or campaigns,\ncivil unrest and/or military\nconflicts, which could\nadversely affect business\nand economic conditions\nabroad and in the U.S.\n                                                         \n  Business Operations                                    \n                                                         \nA failure in or breach of\nour operational or security\nsystems or infrastructure or\nbusiness continuity plans,\nor those of third parties or\nthe financial services\nindustry, could disrupt our\ncritical business operations\nand customer services,\nresult in regulatory,\nmarket, privacy, liquidity\nand operational risk\nexposures, and adversely\nimpact our results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, and cause legal\nor reputational harm.\n\nThe potential for\noperational risk exposure\nexists throughout our\norganization and as a result\nof our interactions with,\nand reliance on, third\nparties (including their\ndownstream service\nproviders) and the financial\nservices industry\ninfrastructure. Our\noperational and security\nsystems infrastructure,\nincluding our computer\nsystems, emerging\ntechnologies, data\nmanagement and internal\nprocesses, as well as those\nof third parties, are\nintegral to our performance.\nWe also rely on our\nemployees and third parties\n(including downstream\nservice providers) in our\nday-to-day and ongoing\noperations, who may, as a\nresult of human error,\nmisconduct (including\nfraudulent activity),\nmalfeasance or a failure or\nbreach of systems or\ninfrastructure cause\ndisruptions to our\norganization and expose us\nto operational and\nregulatory risk.\n\nAdditionally, our financial,\naccounting, data processing\nand transmission, storage,\nbackup or other operating or\nsecurity systems and\ninfrastructure, or those of\nthird parties with whom we\ninteract or upon whom we\nrely may fail to operate\nproperly or become disabled\nor damaged as a result of a\nnumber of factors including\nevents that are wholly or\npartially beyond our or such\nthird party\u2019s control, which\ncould adversely affect our\nability to process\ntransactions or provide\nservices. We could also\nexperience prolonged\ncomputer and network outages\nresulting in disruptions to\nour critical business\noperations and customer\nservices, including abuse or\nfailure of our electronic\ntrading and algorithmic\nplatforms. We may experience\nsudden increases in customer\ntransaction volume or\nelectrical,\ntelecommunications or other\nmajor physical\ninfrastructure outages,\nnewly identified\nvulnerabilities in key\nhardware or software,\nfailure of aging\ninfrastructure and\ntechnology project\nimplementation challenges,\nwhich could result in\nprolonged operational\noutages. Climate change is\nincreasing the frequency and\nseverity of natural\ndisasters, such as\nearthquakes, wildfires,\ntornadoes, hurricanes and\nfloods, which could result\nin increased exposure to\noperational risks, including\noutages. Additionally,\nevents arising from local or\nlarger scale political or\nsocial matters, including\ncivil unrest and terrorist\nacts, could result in\noperational disruptions and\nprolonged operational\noutages.\n\nAdditionally, the\nCorporation and the third\nparties on which it relies\nhave been and will likely\ncontinue to be subject to\nadditional operational risks\nwhile operating in a work-\nfrom-home posture (which\nplaces greater reliance on\nremote access tools and\ntechnology and employees\u2019\npersonal systems), while\nexecuting business\ncontinuity plans due to\nCOVID-19. We are\nincreasingly dependent upon\nour information technology\ninfrastructure to operate\nour businesses remotely due\nto our work-from-home\nposture and evolving\ncustomer preferences,\nincluding increased reliance\non digital banking and other\ndigital\n                                                         \n  13Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nservices provided by our\nbusinesses. Effective\nmanagement of our work-from-\nhome posture depends on the\nsecurity, reliability and\nadequacy of such systems. We\nare also at greater risk of\nbusiness disruptions due to\nillness and unavailability.\n\nRegardless of the measures\nwe have taken to implement\ntraining, procedures, backup\nsystems and other safeguards\nto support our operations\nand bolster our operational\nresilience, our ability to\nconduct business may be\nadversely affected by any\nsignificant disruptions to\nus or to third parties\n(including their downstream\nservice providers) with whom\nwe interact or upon whom we\nrely, including systemic\ncyber events that result in\nsystem outages and\nunavailability of part or\nall of the financial\nservices industry\ninfrastructure. Our ability\nto implement backup systems\nand other safeguards with\nrespect to third-party\nsystems and the financial\nservices industry\ninfrastructure is more\nlimited than with respect to\nour own systems.\n\nFurthermore, to the extent\nthat backup systems are\navailable and utilized, they\nmay not process data as\nquickly as our primary\nsystems and some data might\nnot have been backed up. We\nregularly update the systems\non which we rely to support\nour operations and growth\nand to remain compliant with\nall applicable laws, rules\nand regulations globally.\nThis updating entails\nsignificant costs and\ncreates risks associated\nwith implementing new\nsystems and integrating them\nwith existing ones,\nincluding business\ninterruptions. A failure or\nbreach of our operational or\nsecurity systems or\ninfrastructure or business\ncontinuity plans resulting\nin disruption to our\ncritical business operations\nand customer services could\nexpose us to regulatory,\nmarket, privacy and\nliquidity risk, and\nadversely impact our results\nof operations and financial\ncondition, as well as cause\nlegal or reputational harm.\n\nA cyber attack, information\nor security breach, or a\ntechnology failure of ours\nor of a third party could\nadversely affect our ability\nto conduct our business,\nmanage our exposure to risk\nor expand our businesses,\nresult in the disclosure or\nmisuse of confidential or\nproprietary information,\nand/or fraudulent activity,\nand increase our costs to\nmaintain and update our\noperational and security\nsystems and infrastructure.\n\nOur business is highly\ndependent on the security,\ncontrols and efficacy of our\ninfrastructure, computer and\ndata management systems, as\nwell as those of our\ncustomers, suppliers,\ncounterparties and other\nthird parties (including\ntheir downstream service\nproviders) the financial\nservices industry and\nfinancial data aggregators,\nwith whom we interact, on\nwhom we rely or who have\naccess to our customers'\npersonal or account\ninformation. Our business\nrelies on effective access\nmanagement and the secure\ncollection, processing,\ntransmission, storage and\nretrieval of confidential,\nproprietary, personal and\nother information in our\ncomputer and data management\nsystems and networks, and in\nthe computer and data\nmanagement systems and\nnetworks of third parties.\nIn addition, to access our\nnetwork, products and\nservices, our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers,\ncounterparties and other\nthird parties increasingly\nuse personal mobile devices\nor computing devices that\nare outside of our network\nand control environments and\nare subject to their own\ncybersecurity risks.\n\nWe, our employees and\ncustomers, regulators and\nother third parties\n(including contractors and\nvendors) are regularly the\ntarget of cyber attacks and\nare likely to continue to be\nthe target of cyber attacks.\nThese cyber attacks are\npervasive, sophisticated,\nevolving, difficult to\nprevent and include computer\nviruses, malicious or\ndestructive code (such as\nransomware), social\nengineering (including\nphishing, vishing and\nsmithing), denial of service\nor information or other\nsecurity breach tactics that\ncould result in the\nunauthorized release,\ngathering,\n\nmonitoring, misuse, loss or\ndestruction or theft of\nconfidential, proprietary\nand other information,\nincluding intellectual\nproperty, of ours, our\nemployees, our customers or\nof third parties. These\ncyber attacks could also\nresult in damages to\nsystems, financial risk or\notherwise material\ndisruption to our or our\ncustomers\u2019 or other third\nparties\u2019 network access or\nbusiness operations, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk and\nexposure remains heightened\nbecause of, among other\nthings, the evolving nature\nand pervasiveness of cyber\nthreats, our prominent size\nand scale, our geographic\nfootprint and international\npresence and our role in the\nfinancial services industry\nand the broader economy.\nAdditionally, our risk and\nexposure to cyber attacks\nand security breaches is\nmagnified due to our work-\nfrom-home posture which\nplaces greater reliance on\nremote access tools and\ntechnology, resulting in a\nlarger number of access\npoints to our networks that\nmust be secured. This\nincreased risk of\nunauthorized access to our\nnetworks results in greater\namounts of information being\navailable for access from\nemployees\u2019 personal devices\nover which we do not have\nthe same controls as we do\nin a non-work-from-home\nposture. Additionally, our\ncustomers\u2019 increasing\nreliance on digital banking\nand other digital services\nprovided by our businesses\nin response to COVID-19, has\nresulted in more demand on\nour information technology\ninfrastructure and security\ntools and processes.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry is particularly at\nrisk because of the\nproliferation of new and\nemerging technologies,\nincluding third-party\nfinancial data aggregators,\nand the use of the internet\nand telecommunications\ntechnologies to conduct\nfinancial transactions.\nAdditionally, our use of\nautomation, artificial\nintelligence (AI) and\nrobotics, increased use of\ninternet and mobile banking\nproducts, including mobile\npayment and other web- and\ncloud-based products and\napplications and plans to\nuse or develop additional\nremote connectivity\nsolutions increase our\ncybersecurity risks and\nexposure.\n\nAdditionally, we have\nexposure to cyber threats as\na result of our continuous\ntransmission of sensitive\ninformation to, and storage\nof such information by,\nthird parties, including our\nvendors and regulators, the\noutsourcing of some of our\nbusiness operations, and\nsystem and customer account\nupdates and conversions.\nCybersecurity risks have\nalso significantly increased\nin recent years in part due\nto the increasingly\nsophisticated activities of\norganized crime groups,\nhackers, terrorist\norganizations, extremist\nparties, hostile foreign\ngovernments and state-\nsponsored actors, in some\ninstances acting to promote\npolitical ends. We could\nalso be the target of\ndisgruntled employees or\nvendors, activists and other\nparties, including those\ninvolved in corporate\nespionage.\n\nCyber threats and the\ntechniques used in cyber\nattacks change rapidly and\nfrequently. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to\nprotect the integrity and\nresilience of our systems\nand implement controls,\nprocesses, policies and\nother protective measures,\nwe may not be able to\nanticipate cyber attacks or\ninformation or security\nbreaches and implement\neffective preventive or\ndefensive measures to\naddress or mitigate such\nattacks or breaches. Even\nthe most advanced internal\ncontrol environment is\nvulnerable to compromise.\nInternal access management\nfailures could result in the\ncompromise or unauthorized\nexposure of confidential\ndata.\n\nCyber attacks or security\nbreaches could persist for\nan extended period of time\nbefore being detected. It\ncould take considerable\nadditional time for us to\ndetermine the scope, extent,\namount, and type of\ninformation compromised, at\nwhich time the impact on the\nCorporation and measures to\nrecover and restore to a\nbusiness-as-usual state may\nbe difficult to\n                                                         \n  Bank of America14                                      \n                                                         \nassess. As cyber threats\ncontinue to evolve, we may\nbe required to expend\nsignificant additional\nresources to modify or\nenhance our protective\nmeasures, investigate and\nremediate any information\nsecurity vulnerabilities or\nincidents and develop our\ncapabilities to respond and\nrecover. As a result,\nincreasing resources to\ndevelop and enhance our\ncontrols, processes and\npractices designed to\nprotect our systems,\nworkstations, intellectual\nproperty and proprietary\ninformation, software, data\nand networks from attack,\ndamage or unauthorized\naccess, remains a critical\npriority.\n\nWe also face indirect\ntechnology, cybersecurity\nand operational risks\nrelating to the customers,\nclients and other third\nparties (including their\ndownstream service\nproviders) and the financial\nservices industry, with whom\nwe do business, upon whom we\nrely to facilitate or enable\nour business activities or\nupon whom our customers\nrely. Such third parties\nalso include financial\ncounterparties, financial\ndata aggregators, financial\nintermediaries, such as\nclearing agents, exchanges\nand clearing houses,\nvendors, regulators,\nproviders of critical\ninfrastructure, such as\ninternet access and\nelectrical power, and\nretailers for whom we\nprocess transactions. As a\nresult of increasing\nconsolidation,\ninterdependence and\ncomplexity of financial\nentities and technology\nsystems, a technology\nfailure, cyber attack or\nother information or\nsecurity breach that\nsignificantly degrades,\ndeletes or compromises the\nsystems or data of one or\nmore financial entities or\nthird parties (or their\ndownstream service\nproviders) could have a\nmaterial impact on\ncounterparties or other\nmarket participants,\nincluding us. Similarly, any\nfailure, cyber attack or\nother information or\nsecurity breach that\nsignificantly degrades,\ndeletes or compromises our\nsystems or data could\nadversely impact third\nparties, counterparties and\nthe financial services\nindustry infrastructure,\nwhich in turn could harm our\nreputation and damage our\nbusiness. This\nconsolidation,\ninterconnectivity and\ncomplexity increases the\nrisk of operational failure,\non both individual and\nindustry-wide bases, as\ndisparate systems need to be\nintegrated, often on an\naccelerated basis. Any\ntechnology failure, cyber\nattack or other information\nor security breach,\ntermination or constraint of\nany third party (including\ntheir downstream service\nproviders) the financial\nservices industry\ninfrastructure or financial\ndata aggregators, could,\namong other things,\nadversely affect our ability\nto conduct day-to-day\nbusiness activities, effect\ntransactions, service our\nclients, manage our exposure\nto risk or expand our\nbusinesses, result in the\nmisappropriation or\ndestruction of the personal,\nproprietary or confidential\ninformation of our\nemployees, customers,\nsuppliers, counterparties\nand other third parties or\nresult in fraudulent or\nunauthorized transactions.\nFurther, any such event may\nnot be disclosed to us in a\ntimely manner.\n\nAlthough to date we have not\nexperienced any material\nlosses or other material\nconsequences relating to\ntechnology failure, cyber\nattacks or other information\nor security breaches,\nwhether directed at us or\nthird parties, there can be\nno assurance that our\ncontrols and procedures in\nplace to monitor and\nmitigate the risks of cyber\nthreats will be sufficient\nand that we will not suffer\nmaterial losses or\nconsequences in the future.\nCyber attacks or other\ninformation or security\nbreaches, whether directed\nat us or third parties, may\nresult in significant lost\nrevenue, give rise to losses\nand claims brought by third\nparties, government\npenalties and other negative\nconsequences. Furthermore,\nthe public perception that a\ncyber attack on our systems\nhas been successful, whether\nor not this perception is\ncorrect, may damage our\nreputation with customers\nand third parties with whom\nwe do business. Although we\nmaintain cyber insurance,\nthere can be no assurance\nthat liabilities or losses\n\nwe may incur will be covered\nunder such policies or that\nthe amount of insurance will\nbe adequate.\n\nAlso, successful penetration\nor circumvention of system\nsecurity could result in\nnegative consequences,\nincluding loss of customers\nand business opportunities,\nthe withdrawal of customer\ndeposits, prolonged computer\nand network outages\nresulting in disruptions to\nour critical business\noperations and customer\nservices, misappropriation\nor destruction of our\nintellectual property,\nproprietary information or\nconfidential information\nand/or the confidential,\nproprietary or personal\ninformation of certain\nparties, such as our\nemployees, customers,\nsuppliers, counterparties\nand other third parties, or\ndamage to their computers or\nsystems. This could result\nin a violation of applicable\nprivacy and other laws in\nthe U.S. and abroad,\nlitigation exposure,\nregulatory fines, penalties\nor intervention, loss of\nconfidence in our security\nmeasures, reputational\ndamage, reimbursement or\nother compensatory costs,\nadditional compliance costs,\nand our internal controls or\ndisclosure controls being\nrendered ineffective. The\noccurrence of any of these\nevents could adversely\nimpact our results of\noperations, liquidity and\nfinancial condition.\n\nFailure to satisfy our\nobligations as servicer for\nresidential mortgage\nsecuritizations, loans owned\nby other entities and other\nlosses we could incur as\nservicer, could adversely\nimpact our reputation,\nservicing costs or results\nof operations.\n\nWe and our legacy companies\nservice mortgage loans on\nbehalf of third-party\nsecuritization vehicles and\nother investors. If we\ncommit a material breach of\nour obligations as servicer\nor master servicer, we may\nbe subject to termination if\nthe breach is not cured\nwithin a specified period of\ntime following notice, which\ncould cause us to lose\nservicing income. In\naddition, we may have\nliability for any failure by\nus, as a servicer or master\nservicer, for any act or\nomission on our part that\ninvolves willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith,\ngross negligence or reckless\ndisregard of our duties. If\nany such breach was found to\nhave occurred, it may harm\nour reputation, increase our\nservicing costs, result in\nlitigation or regulatory\naction or adversely impact\nour results of operations.\nAdditionally, with respect\nto foreclosures, we may\nincur costs or losses due to\nirregularities in the\nunderlying documentation, or\nif the validity of a\nforeclosure action is\nchallenged by a borrower or\noverturned by a court\nbecause of errors or\ndeficiencies in the\nforeclosure process. We may\nalso incur costs or losses\nrelating to delays or\nalleged deficiencies in\nprocessing documents\nnecessary to comply with\nstate law governing\nforeclosure.\n\nChanges in the structure of\nand relationship among the\nGSEs could adversely impact\nour business.\n\nDuring 2020, we sold\napproximately $3.6 billion\nof loans to GSEs, primarily\nFreddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC\nand Fannie Mae (FNMA) are\ncurrently in conservatorship\nwith their primary\nregulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency\n(FHFA) acting as\nconservator. In September\n2019, the Treasury\nDepartment published a\nproposal to recapitalize\nFHLMC and FNMA and remove\nthem from conservatorship as\nwell as reduce their role in\nthe marketplace. Consistent\nwith this proposal, in\nJanuary 2021, the Treasury\nDepartment further amended\nthe agreement that governs\nthe conservatorship of FHLMC\nand FNMA to allow them to\nretain their earnings until\nthey reach certain\npreviously determined\ncapital requirements, among\nother policy actions,\npotentially putting them on\na long-term path to\nemergence from\nconservatorship. However, we\ncannot predict the future\nprospects of the GSEs,\ntiming of the\nrecapitalization or release\nfrom conservatorship, or\ncontent of legislative or\nrulemaking proposals\nregarding the future status\nof the GSEs in the housing\nmarket. Additionally, if the\nGSEs were to take a reduced\nrole in\n                                                         \n  15Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nthe marketplace, including\nby limiting the mortgage\nproducts they offer, we\ncould be required to seek\nalternative funding sources,\nretain additional loans on\nour balance sheet, secure\nfunding through the Federal\nHome Loan Bank system, or\nsecuritize the loans through\nPrivate Label\nSecuritization. Accordingly,\nuncertainty regarding their\nfuture and the mortgage-\nbacked securities they\nguarantee continues to exist\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\nAny of these developments\ncould adversely affect the\nvalue of our securities\nportfolios, capital levels,\nliquidity and results of\noperations.\n\nOur risk management\nframework may not be\neffective in mitigating risk\nand reducing the potential\nfor losses.\n\nOur risk management\nframework is designed to\nminimize risk and loss to\nus. We seek to effectively\nand consistently identify,\nmeasure, monitor, report and\ncontrol the types of risk to\nwhich we are subject,\nincluding strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and\nreputational risks. While we\nemploy a broad and\ndiversified set of controls\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, including\nmodeling and forecasting,\nhedging strategies and\ntechniques that seek to\nbalance our ability to\nprofit from trading\npositions with our exposure\nto potential losses, our\nability to control and\nmitigate risks that result\nin losses is inherently\nlimited by our ability to\nidentify all risks,\nincluding emerging and\nunknown risks, anticipate\nthe timing of risks, apply\neffective hedging\nstrategies, make correct\nassumptions, manage and\naggregate data correctly and\nefficiently, and develop\nrisk management models to\nassess and control risk.\n\nOur ability to manage risk\nis dependent on our ability\nto consistently execute all\nelements of our risk\nmanagement program and\ndevelop and maintain a\nculture of managing risk\nwell throughout the\nCorporation and manage risks\nassociated with third\nparties (including their\ndownstream service\nproviders) and vendors, to\nenable effective risk\nmanagement and ensure that\nrisks are appropriately\nconsidered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely\nmanner. Uncertain economic\nconditions, heightened\nlegislative and regulatory\nscrutiny of and change\nwithin the financial\nservices industry, the pace\nof technological changes,\naccounting and market\ndevelopments, the failure of\nemployees to comply with\npolicies, values and our\nrisk framework and the\noverall complexity of our\noperations, among other\ndevelopments, may result in\na heightened level of risk\nfor us. We have experienced\nincreased operational,\nreputational and compliance\nrisk as a result of the need\nto rapidly implement\nmultiple and varying\npandemic relief programs,\nincluding consumer and\ncommercial assistance\nprograms and the PPP,\ncoupled with the concurrent\ntransition of the\nCorporation\u2019s workforce to a\nwork-from-home posture.\nAccordingly, we could suffer\nlosses as a result of our\nfailure to manage evolving\nrisks or properly\nanticipate, manage, control\nor mitigate risks.\n                                                         \n  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal                       \n                                                         \nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive government\nlegislation and regulations\nand certain settlements,\norders and agreements with\ngovernment authorities from\ntime to time.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive regulation\nunder federal and state laws\nin the U.S. and the laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, including\nincreasing and complex\neconomic sanctions regimes.\nThese laws and regulations\nsignificantly affect and\nhave the potential to\nrestrict the scope of our\nexisting businesses, limit\nour ability to pursue\ncertain business\nopportunities, including the\nproducts and\n\nservices we offer, reduce\ncertain fees and rates or\nmake our products and\nservices more expensive for\nour clients.\n\nWe continue to make\nadjustments to our business\nand operations, legal entity\nstructure and capital and\nliquidity management\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols to comply with\ncurrently effective laws and\nregulations, as well as\nfinal rulemaking, guidance\nand interpretation by\nregulatory authorities,\nincluding the Department of\nTreasury, Federal Reserve,\nOCC, CFPB, Financial\nStability Oversight Council,\nFDIC, Department of Labor,\nSEC and CFTC in the U.S. and\nforeign regulators and other\ngovernment authorities.\nFurther, we could become\nsubject to future\nlegislation and regulatory\nrequirements beyond those\ncurrently proposed, adopted\nor contemplated in the U.S.\nor abroad, including\npolicies and rulemaking\nrelated to the Financial\nReform Act, the pandemic and\nclimate change. The\ncumulative effect of all of\nthe legislation and\nregulations on our business,\noperations and profitability\nremains uncertain. This\nuncertainty necessitates\nthat in our business\nplanning we make certain\nassumptions with respect to\nthe scope and requirements\nof prospective and proposed\nrules. If these assumptions\nprove incorrect, we could be\nsubject to increased\nregulatory and compliance\nrisks and costs as well as\npotential reputational harm.\nIn addition, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory\ninitiatives may overlap, and\nnon-U.S. regulations and\ninitiatives may be\ninconsistent or may conflict\nwith current or proposed\nU.S. regulations, which\ncould lead to compliance\nrisks and increased costs.\n\nOur regulators\u2019 prudential\nand supervisory authority\ngives them broad power and\ndiscretion to direct our\nactions, and they have\nassumed an active oversight,\ninspection and investigatory\nrole across the financial\nservices industry. However,\nregulatory focus is not\nlimited to laws and\nregulations applicable to\nthe financial services\nindustry, but extends to\nother significant laws and\nregulations that apply\nacross industries and\njurisdictions, including\nthose related to data\nmanagement and privacy,\nanti-money laundering, anti-\ncorruption and economic\nsanctions.\n\nWe are also subject to laws,\nrules and regulations in the\nU.S. and abroad, including\nGDPR, CCPA and CPRA,\nregarding compliance with\nour privacy policies and the\ndisclosure, collection, use,\nsharing and safeguarding of\npersonal identifiable\ninformation of certain\nparties, such as our\nemployees, customers,\nsuppliers, counterparties\nand other third parties, the\nviolation of which could\nresult in litigation,\nregulatory fines and\nenforcement actions.\nAdditionally, we will likely\nbe subject to new and\nevolving data privacy laws\nin the U.S. and abroad,\nwhich could result in\nadditional costs of\ncompliance, litigation,\nregulatory fines and\nenforcement actions. In\nparticular, there is\nincreased complexity and\nuncertainty, including\npotential suspension or\nprohibition, regarding the\nstandards used by the\nCorporation for cross-border\nflows and transfers of\npersonal data from the\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA)\nto the U.S. and other\njurisdictions outside of the\nEEA resulting from a\ndecision of the Court of\nJustice of the EU and\nguidance from the European\nData Protection Board.\nAdditionally, the European\nCommission has proposed new\nstandards of personal data\ntransfer. If our personal\ndata transfers are suspended\nor prohibited or we are\nrequired to implement new\nstandards, this could result\nin operational disruptions\nto our businesses,\nadditional costs, increased\nenforcement activity, new\ncontract negotiations with\nthird parties, and/or\nmodification of our cross-\nborder data management.\n\nAs part of their enforcement\nauthority, our regulators\nand other government\nauthorities have the\nauthority to, among other\nthings, assess significant\ncivil or criminal monetary\npenalties or restitution and\nissue cease and desist or\nremoval orders and\n                                                         \n  Bank of America16                                      \n                                                         \ninitiate injunctive actions.\nThe amounts paid by us and\nother financial institutions\nto settle proceedings or\ninvestigations have, in some\ninstances, been substantial\nand may increase. In some\ncases, governmental\nauthorities have required\ncriminal pleas or other\nextraordinary terms as part\nof such resolutions, which\ncould have significant\nconsequences, including\nreputational harm, loss of\ncustomers, restrictions on\nthe ability to access\ncapital markets, and the\ninability to operate certain\nbusinesses or offer certain\nproducts for a period of\ntime.\n\nThe Corporation and the\nconduct of its employees and\nrepresentatives are subject\nto regulatory scrutiny\nacross jurisdictions. The\ncomplexity of the federal\nand state regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the\nglobal scope of our\noperations and the\nregulatory environment\nworldwide also means that a\nsingle event or practice or\na series of related events\nor practices may give rise\nto a significant number of\noverlapping investigations\nand regulatory proceedings,\neither by multiple federal\nand state agencies in the\nU.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\ndifferent jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, actions by\nother members of the\nfinancial services industry\nrelated to business\nactivities in which we\nparticipate may result in\ninvestigations by regulators\nor other government\nauthorities. Responding to\ninquiries, investigations,\nlawsuits and proceedings is\ntime-consuming and expensive\nand can divert senior\nmanagement attention from\nour business. The outcome of\nsuch proceedings, which may\nlast a number of years, may\nbe difficult to predict or\nestimate.\n\nWe are and may become\nsubject to the terms of\nsettlements, orders and\nagreements that we have\nentered into with government\nentities and regulatory\nauthorities, which impose,\nor could impose, significant\noperational and compliance\ncosts on us as they\ntypically require us to\nenhance our procedures and\ncontrols, expand our risk\nand control functions within\nour lines of business,\ninvest in technology and\nhire significant numbers of\nadditional risk, control and\ncompliance personnel.\nMoreover, if we fail to meet\nthe requirements of the\nregulatory settlements,\norders or agreements to\nwhich we are subject, or,\nmore generally, fail to\nmaintain risk and control\nprocedures and processes\nthat meet the heightened\nstandards established by our\nregulators and other\ngovernment authorities, we\ncould be required to enter\ninto further settlements,\norders or agreements and pay\nadditional fines, penalties\nor judgments, or accept\nmaterial regulatory\nrestrictions on our\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile we believe that we\nhave adopted appropriate\nrisk management and\ncompliance programs to\nidentify, assess, monitor\nand report on applicable\nlaws, policies and\nprocedures, compliance risks\nwill continue to exist,\nparticularly as we adapt to\nnew and evolving laws, rules\nand regulations.\nAdditionally, changing U.S.\nfiscal, monetary and\nregulatory policies arising\nfrom changes to the U.S.\npresidential administration\nand Congress result in\nongoing regulatory\nuncertainties. There is no\nguarantee that our risk\nmanagement and compliance\nprograms will be\nconsistently executed to\nsuccessfully manage\ncompliance risk. We also\nrely upon third parties who\nmay expose us to compliance\nand legal risk. Future\nlegislative or regulatory\nactions, and any required\nchanges to our business or\noperations, or those of\nthird parties (including\ntheir downstream providers)\nupon whom we rely, resulting\nfrom such developments and\nactions could result in a\nsignificant loss of revenue,\nimpose additional compliance\nand other costs or otherwise\nreduce our profitability,\nlimit the products and\nservices that we offer or\nour ability to pursue\ncertain business\nopportunities, require us to\ndispose of or curtail\ncertain businesses, affect\nthe value of assets that we\nhold, require us to increase\nour prices and therefore\nreduce demand for our\n\nproducts, or otherwise\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses. In addition,\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings and other\ncontingencies will arise\nfrom time to time that may\nresult in fines, regulatory\nsanctions, penalties,\nequitable relief and changes\nto our business practices.\nAs a result, we are and will\ncontinue to be subject to\nheightened compliance and\noperating costs that could\nadversely affect our results\nof operations.\n\nWe are subject to\nsignificant financial and\nreputational risks from\npotential liability arising\nfrom lawsuits and regulatory\nand government action.\n\nWe continue to face\nsignificant legal risks in\nour business, with a high\nvolume of claims against us\nand other financial\ninstitutions. The damages,\npenalties and fines that\nlitigants and regulators\nseek from us and other\nfinancial institutions\ncontinue to be high. This\nincludes disputes with\nconsumers, customers and\nother counterparties.\n\nFinancial institutions,\nincluding us, continue to be\nthe subject of claims\nalleging anti-competitive\nconduct with respect to\nvarious products and\nmarkets, including U.S.\nantitrust class actions\nclaiming joint and several\nliability for treble\ndamages. As disclosed in\nNote 12 \u2014 Commitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements, we also face\ncontractual indemnification\nand loan-repurchase claims\narising from alleged\nbreaches of representations\nand warranties in the sale\nof residential mortgages by\nlegacy companies, which may\nresult in a requirement that\nwe repurchase the mortgage\nloans, or otherwise make\nwhole or provide other\nremedies to counterparties.\n\nIn addition, regulatory\nauthorities have had a\nsupervisory focus on\nenforcement, including in\nconnection with alleged\nviolations of law and\ncustomer harm. For example,\nU.S. regulators and\ngovernment agencies have\npursued claims against\nfinancial institutions under\nthe Financial Institutions\nReform, Recovery, and\nEnforcement Act, False\nClaims Act, Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, Fair\nHousing Act and antitrust\nlaws. Such claims may carry\nsignificant and, in certain\ncases, treble damages. T\nhere is also an increased\nfocus on compliance with\nglobal laws, rules and\nregulations related to the\ncollection, use, sharing and\nsafeguarding of personally\nidentifiable information and\ncorporate data.\nAdditionally, misconduct by\nemployees, including\nunethical, fraudulent,\nimproper or illegal conduct,\nor other unfair, deceptive,\nabusive or discriminatory\nbusiness practices, can\nresult in litigation and/or\ngovernment investigations\nand enforcement actions, and\ncause significant\nreputational harm.\n\nThe global environment of\nextensive regulation,\nregulatory compliance\nburdens, litigation and\nregulatory enforcement,\ncombined with uncertainty\nrelated to the continually\nevolving regulatory\nenvironment, may affect\noperational and compliance\ncosts and risks, which may\nlimit or cease our ability\nto continue providing\ncertain products and\nservices. This is magnified\nby the Corporation's\nimplementation of government\nrelief measures related to\nthe pandemic. Lawsuits and\nregulatory actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties and\nfines adverse to the\nCorporation. Litigation and\ninvestigation costs,\nsubstantial legal liability\nor significant regulatory or\ngovernment action against us\ncould have adverse effects\non our business, financial\ncondition, including\nliquidity, and results of\noperations, and/or cause\nsignificant reputational\nharm to us.\n\nU.S. federal banking\nagencies may require us to\nincrease our regulatory\ncapital, total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (TLAC),\nlong-term debt or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S.\nregulatory capital and\nliquidity rules. These\nrules, among other things,\nestablish minimum\nrequirements to qualify as a\nwell-capitalized\ninstitution. If any of\n                                                         \n  17Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nour subsidiary insured\ndepository institutions\nfails to maintain its status\nas well capitalized under\nthe applicable regulatory\ncapital rules, the Federal\nReserve will require us to\nagree to bring the insured\ndepository institution back\nto well-capitalized status.\nFor the duration of such an\nagreement, the Federal\nReserve may impose\nrestrictions on our\nactivities. If we were to\nfail to enter into or comply\nwith such an agreement, or\nfail to comply with the\nterms of such agreement, the\nFederal Reserve may impose\nmore severe restrictions on\nour activities, including\nrequiring us to cease and\ndesist activities permitted\nunder the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956.\n\nCapital and liquidity\nrequirements are frequently\nintroduced and amended. It\nis possible that regulators\nmay increase regulatory\ncapital requirements\nincluding TLAC and long-term\ndebt requirements, change\nhow regulatory capital is\ncalculated or increase\nliquidity requirements. Our\nability to return capital to\nour shareholders depends in\npart on our ability to\nmaintain regulatory capital\nlevels above minimum\nrequirements plus buffers.\nTo the extent that increases\noccur in our SCB, G-SIB\nsurcharge or countercyclical\ncapital buffer, our returns\nof capital to shareholders\ncould decrease.\n\nAs part of its CCAR, the\nFederal Reserve conducts\nstress testing on parts of\nour business using\nhypothetical economic\nscenarios prepared by the\nFederal Reserve. Those\nscenarios may affect our\nCCAR stress test results,\nwhich may impact the level\nof our SCB. Additionally,\nthe Federal Reserve may\nimpose limitations or\nprohibitions on taking\ncapital actions, such as\npaying or increasing\ndividends or repurchasing\ncommon stock. For example,\nas a result of the economic\nuncertainty resulting from\nthe pandemic, the Federal\nReserve applied certain\nrestrictions on our common\nstock dividends and\nrepurchase program during\nthe second half of 2020, and\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nas disclosed in Item 1.\nBusiness \u2013 Distributions on\npage 5 and MD&A \u2013 Executive\nSummary \u2013 Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 Capital\nManagement on page 25.\n\nA significant component of\nregulatory capital ratios is\ncalculating our RWA and our\nleverage exposure, which may\nincrease. The Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision has also revised\nseveral key methodologies\nfor measuring RWA that have\nnot yet been implemented in\nthe U.S., including a\nstandardized approach for\noperational risk, revised\nmarket risk requirements and\nconstraints on the use of\ninternal models, as well as\na capital floor based on the\nrevised standardized\napproaches. U.S. banking\nregulators may update the\nU.S. Basel 3 rules to\nincorporate the Basel\nCommittee revisions.\n\nChanges to and compliance\nwith the regulatory capital\nand liquidity requirements\nmay impact our operations by\nrequiring us to liquidate\nassets, increase borrowings,\nissue additional equity or\nother securities, cease or\nalter certain operations or\nhold highly liquid assets,\nwhich may adversely affect\nour results of operations.\n\nChanges in accounting\nstandards or assumptions in\napplying accounting policies\ncould adversely affect us.\n\nOur accounting policies and\nmethods are fundamental to\nhow we record and report our\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations. Some\nof these policies require\nuse of estimates and\nassumptions that may affect\nthe reported value of our\nassets or liabilities and\nresults of operations and\nare critical because they\nrequire management to make\ndifficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments about\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain. If those\nassumptions, estimates or\njudgments were incorrectly\nmade, we could be required\nto correct and restate\nprior-period financial\nstatements. Accounting\nstandard-setters and those\nwho interpret the accounting\nstandards, the SEC, banking\nregulators and our\nindependent registered\npublic accounting firm may\nalso\n\namend or even reverse their\nprevious interpretations or\npositions on how various\nstandards should be applied.\nThese changes may be\ndifficult to predict and\ncould impact how we prepare\nand report our financial\nstatements. In some cases,\nwe could be required to\napply a new or revised\nstandard retrospectively,\nresulting in us revising\nprior-period financial\nstatements.\n\nWe may be adversely affected\nby changes in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. tax laws and\nregulations.\n\nIn December 2017, the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (the Tax\nAct) was enacted, which made\nsignificant changes to\nfederal income tax law\nincluding, among other\nthings, reducing the\nstatutory corporate income\ntax rate to 21 percent from\n35 percent and changing the\ntaxation of our non-U.S.\nbusiness activities.\n\nIn addition, we have U.K.\nnet deferred tax assets\n(DTA) which consist\nprimarily of net operating\nlosses that are expected to\nbe realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an\nextended number of years.\nAdverse developments with\nrespect to tax laws or to\nother material factors, such\nas prolonged worsening of\nEurope\u2019s capital markets or\nchanges in the ability of\nour U.K. subsidiaries to\nconduct business in the EU,\ncould lead our management to\nreassess and/or change its\ncurrent conclusion that no\nvaluation allowance is\nnecessary with respect to\nour U.K. net DTA.\n\nIt is possible that\ngovernmental authorities in\nthe U.S. and/or other\ncountries could further\namend or repeal tax laws in\na way that would adversely\naffect us, including the\npossibility that aspects of\nthe Tax Act could be amended\nin the future. Any future\nchange in tax laws and\nregulations or\ninterpretations of current\nor future tax laws and\nregulations could adversely\naffect our results of\noperations.\n                                                         \n  Reputation                                             \n                                                         \nDamage to our reputation\ncould harm our businesses,\nincluding our competitive\nposition and business\nprospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and\nretain customers, clients,\ninvestors and employees is\nimpacted by our reputation.\nHarm to our reputation can\narise from various sources,\nincluding officer, director\nor employee fraud,\nmisconduct and unethical\nbehavior, security breaches,\nlitigation or regulatory\noutcomes, compensation\npractices, lending\npractices, the suitability\nor reasonableness of\nrecommending particular\ntrading or investment\nstrategies, including the\nreliability of our research\nand models, prohibiting\nclients from engaging in\ncertain transactions and\nemployee sales practices.\nAdditionally, our reputation\nmay be harmed by failing to\ndeliver products, subpar\nstandards of service and\nquality expected by our\ncustomers, clients and the\ncommunity, compliance\nfailures, the inability to\nmanage technology change or\nmaintain effective data\nmanagement, cyber incidents,\ninternal and external fraud,\ninadequacy of responsiveness\nto internal controls,\nunintended disclosure of\npersonal, proprietary or\nconfidential information,\nconflicts of interest and\nbreach of fiduciary\nobligations, the handling of\nhealth emergencies or\npandemics, and the\nactivities of our clients,\ncustomers, counterparties\nand third parties, including\nvendors. For example, our\nreputation may be harmed in\nconnection with our\nimplementation of government\nprograms to provide relief\nto address the economic\nimpact of the pandemic. Our\nreputation may also be\nnegatively impacted by our\nESG practices and\ndisclosures, our businesses\nand our customers, including\npractices and disclosures\nrelated to climate change.\nActions by the financial\nservices industry generally\nor by certain members or\nindividuals in the industry\nalso can adversely affect\nour reputation. In addition,\nadverse publicity or\nnegative information posted\non social media by\nemployees, the media or\notherwise, whether or not\nfactually\n                                                         \n  Bank of America18                                      \n                                                         \ncorrect, may adversely\nimpact our business\nprospects or financial\nresults.\n\nWe are subject to complex\nand evolving laws and\nregulations regarding\nprivacy, know-your-customer\nrequirements, data\nprotection, including the\nGDPR, CCPA and CPRA, cross-\nborder data movement and\nother matters. Principles\nconcerning the appropriate\nscope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy vary\nconsiderably in different\njurisdictions, and\nregulatory and public\nexpectations regarding the\ndefinition and scope of\nconsumer and commercial\nprivacy may remain fluid. It\nis possible that these laws\nmay be interpreted and\napplied by various\njurisdictions in a manner\ninconsistent with our\ncurrent or future practices,\nor that is inconsistent with\none another. If personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ninformation of customers or\nclients in our possession,\nor in the possession of\nthird parties (including\ntheir downstream service\nproviders) or financial data\naggregators, is mishandled,\nmisused or mismanaged, or if\nwe do not timely or\nadequately address such\ninformation, we may face\nregulatory, reputational and\noperational risks which\ncould adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nWe could suffer reputational\nharm if we fail to properly\nidentify and manage\npotential conflicts of\ninterest. Management of\npotential conflicts of\ninterest has become\nincreasingly complex as we\nexpand our business\nactivities through more\nnumerous transactions,\nobligations and interests\nwith and among our clients.\nThe failure to adequately\naddress, or the perceived\nfailure to adequately\naddress, conflicts of\ninterest could affect the\nwillingness of clients to\nuse our products and\nservices, or give rise to\nlitigation or enforcement\nactions, which could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness.\n\nOur actual or perceived\nfailure to address these and\nother issues, such as\noperational risks, gives\nrise to reputational risk\nthat could harm us and our\nbusiness prospects. Failure\nto appropriately address any\nof these issues could also\ngive rise to additional\nregulatory restrictions,\nlegal risks and reputational\nharm, which could, among\nother consequences, increase\nthe size and number of\nlitigation claims and\ndamages asserted or subject\nus to enforcement actions,\nfines and penalties, and\ncause us to incur related\ncosts and expenses.\n                                                         \n  Other                                                  \n                                                         \nReforms to and replacement\nof IBORs and certain other\nrates or indices may\nadversely affect our\nreputation, business,\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nThere is a major transition\nin progress in global\nfinancial markets with\nrespect to the replacement\nof IBORs, including the\nLondon Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR), and certain\nother rates or indices that\nserve as \u201cbenchmarks.\u201d Such\nbenchmarks are used\nextensively across global\nfinancial markets and in our\nbusiness. In particular,\nLIBOR is used in many of our\nproducts and contracts,\nincluding derivatives,\nconsumer and commercial\nloans, mortgages, floating-\nrate notes and other\nadjustable-rate products and\nfinancial instruments. The\naggregate notional amount of\nthese products and contracts\nis material to our business,\nand there are significant\nrisks and challenges\nassociated with the\ntransition that may result\nin significant uncertainty,\nor have other consequences\nthat cannot be fully\nanticipated, which expose us\nto various financial,\noperational, supervisory,\nconduct and legal risks.\n\nAlthough certain ARRs have\nbeen proposed to replace\nLIBOR and other IBORs,\nmarket and client adoption\nof ARRs may vary across or\nwithin categories of\ncontracts, products and\nservices, resulting in\nmarket fragmentation,\ndecreased trading volumes\nand liquidity, increased\ncomplexity and modeling and\n\noperational risks. ARRs have\ncompositions and\ncharacteristics that differ\nsignificantly from the\nbenchmarks they may replace,\nin some cases have limited\nhistory, and may demonstrate\nless predictable performance\nover time than the\nbenchmarks they replace.\nAdditionally, most ARRs are\ncalculated on a compounded\nor weighted-average basis,\ninvolve complex billing and\nreconciliation and, unlike\nIBORs, do not reflect bank\ncredit risk and therefore\nmay require a spread\nadjustment. The market\ntransition from IBORs to\nARRs is complex and there\nare important differences\nbetween the fallbacks,\ntriggers and calculation\nmethodologies being\nimplemented in cash and\nderivatives markets\n(including within cash\nmarkets). Any mismatch\nbetween the adoption of ARRs\nin loans, securities and\nderivatives markets may\nimpact hedging or other\nfinancial arrangements we\nhave implemented, and as a\nresult we may experience\nunanticipated market\nexposures. There can be no\nassurance that ARRs will be\ncomparable or adequate\nalternatives to IBORs or\nperform in the same way,\nthat existing assets and\nliabilities based on or\nlinked to IBORs will\ntransition successfully to\nARRs, of the timing of\nadoption and degree of\nintegration and acceptance\nof ARRs in the financial\nmarkets, or of the future\navailability or\nrepresentativeness of such\nARRs.\n\nThe discontinuation of\nIBORs, including LIBOR,\nrequires us to transition a\nsignificant number of IBOR-\nbased products and\ncontracts, including related\nhedging arrangements (IBOR\nProducts). Although, a\nsignificant majority of the\naggregate notional amount of\nour LIBOR-based products and\ncontracts maturing after\n2021 include or have been\nupdated to include fallbacks\nto ARRs, the transitioning\nof certain contracts,\nproducts and clients will be\nmore complex. While some of\nthese outstanding IBOR\nProducts include fallback\nprovisions to ARRs, some of\nthese products and contracts\ndo not include fallback\nprovisions or adequate\nfallback mechanisms and\nrequire remediation to\nmodify their terms.\nAdditionally, some\noutstanding IBOR Products\nare particularly challenging\nto modify due to the\nrequirement that all\nimpacted parties consent to\nsuch modification.\nLegislation has been adopted\nin the EU and proposed in\nthe U.S. and the U.K. to\naddress such challenges in\nIBOR Products, including the\nuse of a statutory\nreplacement or \u201csynthetic\u201d\nrate to replace the existing\nbenchmark rate in certain of\nour IBOR Products.\nLitigation, disputes or\nother action may occur as a\nresult of the interpretation\nor application of\nlegislation, in particular,\nif there is an overlap\nbetween legislation\nintroduced in different\njurisdictions. There is no\nguarantee that the\nlegislative proposals will\nbecome law and no assurance\nthat we and other market\nparticipants will be able to\nsuccessfully modify all\noutstanding IBOR Products or\nbe adequately prepared for a\ndiscontinuation of an IBOR\nat the time such IBOR may\ncease to be published or\notherwise discontinued.\nAlso, there can be no\nassurance that existing or\nnew provisions for successor\nrates in our IBOR Products\nwill include adequate\nmethodologies for\nadjustments or that the\ncharacteristics of the\nsuccessor rates will be\nsimilar to or produce the\neconomic equivalent of the\nbenchmarks they seek to\nreplace. These changes may\nadversely affect the yield\non loans or securities held\nby us, amounts paid on\nsecurities we have issued,\namounts received and paid on\nderivatives we have entered\ninto, the value of such\nloans, securities or\nderivative instruments, the\ntrading market for such\nproducts and contracts, and\nour ability to effectively\nuse hedging instruments to\nmanage risk. Certain\nimpacted clients,\ncounterparties and other\nmarket participants may\nrefuse, delay, or lack\noperational readiness to\ntransition to ARRs,\nresulting in the risk that\nsome contracts and products\nmay not transition to an ARR\nbefore discontinuation of\nthe relevant IBOR, exposing\nus to financial,\noperational, supervisory,\nconduct and legal risks.\n                                                         \n  19Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nOur products and contracts\nthat reference IBORs, in\nparticular LIBOR, may\ncontain language that\ndetermines when a successor\nrate including the ARR\nand/or the applicable spread\nadjustment to the designated\nrate (including IBORs) would\nbe selected or determined.\nIf a trigger is satisfied,\nour products and contracts\nmay give the calculation\nagent (which may be us)\ndiscretion over the\nsuccessor rate to be\nselected. We may face a risk\nof litigation, disputes or\nother actions from clients,\ncounterparties, customers,\ninvestors or others\nregarding the interpretation\nor enforcement of IBOR-based\ncontract provisions or if we\nfail to appropriately\ncommunicate the effect that\nthe transition to ARRs will\nhave on existing and future\nproducts.\n\nThe Corporation has\nlaunched, and expects to\ncontinue to develop, launch\nand support, ARR-based\nproducts and services. The\ntransition to ARR-based\nproducts is complex and\ninvolves client and\nfinancial contract changes,\ninternal and external\ncommunication, technology\nand operations\nmodifications, industry and\nregulatory engagement,\nmigration of existing\nclients, execution of\nbusiness strategy and\ngovernance. New financial\nproducts linked to ARRs may\nbe less liquid, result in\nmispricing and additional\nlegal, financial, tax,\noperational, market,\ncompliance, reputational,\ncompetitive or other risks\nto us, our clients and other\nmarket participants. There\nis no guarantee that\nliquidity in ARR-based\nproducts will develop, and\nit is possible that ARR-\nbased products will perform\ndifferently to IBOR Products\nduring times of economic\nstress, adverse or volatile\nmarket conditions and across\nthe credit and economic\ncycle, which may impact the\nvalue, return on and\nprofitability of our ARR-\nbased assets.\n\nFailure to meet industry-\nwide IBOR transition\nmilestones and to cease\nissuance of IBOR Products by\nrelevant cessation dates\nmay, subject to certain\nregulatory exceptions,\nresult in supervisory\nenforcement by applicable\nregulators, increase our\ncost of, and access to,\ncapital and other\nconsequences. In addition,\nIBOR Products held by us may\nbecome less liquid as the\ntransition process develops,\nand other unforeseen\nconsequences may arise if\nsuch products are held\nbeyond relevant cessation\ndates.\n\nChanges or uncertainty\nresulting from the market\ntransition from IBORs to\nARRs could adversely affect\nthe return on and pricing,\nliquidity and value of\noutstanding IBOR Products,\ncause significant market\ndislocations and\ndisruptions, potentially\nincrease the cost of and\naccess to capital, increase\nthe risk of litigation or\nother disputes, including in\nconnection with the\ninterpretation and\nenforceability of, or our\nhistorical marketing\npractices or disclosures\nwith respect to outstanding\nIBOR products with\ncounterparties, and/or\nincrease expenses related to\nthe transition to ARRs,\namong other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nThe market transition may\nalso alter our risk profile\nand risk management\nstrategies, including\nderivatives and hedging\nstrategies, modeling and\nanalytics, valuation tools,\nproduct design and systems,\ncontrols, procedures and\noperational infrastructure.\nThis may prove challenging\ngiven the limited history of\nmany of the proposed ARRs\nand may increase the costs\nand risks related to\npotential regulatory\ncompliance, requirements or\ninquiries. Among other\nrisks, various products and\ncontracts may transition to\nARRs at different times or\nin different manners, with\nthe result that we may face\nsignificant unexpected\ninterest rate, pricing or\nother exposures across\nbusiness or product lines.\nReforms to and uncertainty\nregarding market transition\nand other factors may\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, including the\nability to serve customers\nand maintain market share,\nfinancial condition or\nresults of operations and\ncould result in reputational\nharm to the Corporation.\n\nWe face significant and\nincreasing competition in\nthe financial services\nindustry.\n\nWe operate in a highly\ncompetitive environment and\nexperience intense\ncompetition from local and\nglobal financial\ninstitutions as well as new\nentrants, in both domestic\nand foreign markets, in\nwhich we compete on the\nbasis of a number of\nfactors, including customer\nservice, quality and range\nof products and services\noffered, technology, price,\nfees, reputation, interest\nrates on loans and deposits,\nlending limits and customer\nconvenience. Additionally,\nthe changing regulatory\nenvironment may create\ncompetitive disadvantages\nfor us given geography-\ndriven capital and liquidity\nrequirements. Additionally,\nwe may face competitors with\nmore experience and\nestablished relationships in\nthe relevant market, which\ncould adversely affect our\nability to compete.\n\nIn addition, emerging\ntechnologies and advances\nand the growth of e-commerce\nhave lowered geographic and\nmonetary barriers of other\nfinancial institutions, made\nit easier for non-depository\ninstitutions to offer\nproducts and services that\ntraditionally were banking\nproducts and allowed non-\ntraditional financial\nservice providers and\ntechnology companies to\ncompete with traditional\nfinancial service companies\nin providing electronic and\ninternet-based financial\nsolutions and services,\nincluding electronic\nsecurities trading with low\nor no fees and commissions,\nmarketplace lending,\nfinancial data aggregation\nand payment processing,\nincluding real-time payment\nplatforms. Further, clients\nmay choose to conduct\nbusiness with other market\nparticipants who engage in\nbusiness or offer products\nin areas we deem speculative\nor risky, such as\ncryptocurrencies. Increased\ncompetition may negatively\naffect our earnings by\ncreating pressure to lower\nprices, fees, commissions or\ncredit standards on our\nproducts and services\nrequiring additional\ninvestment to improve the\nquality and delivery of our\ntechnology and/or reducing\nour market share, or\naffecting the willingness of\nour clients to do business\nwith us.\n\nOur inability to adapt our\nproducts and services could\nharm our business.\n\nOur business model is based\non a diversified mix of\nbusinesses that provide a\nbroad range of financial\nproducts and services,\ndelivered through multiple\ndistribution channels. Our\nsuccess depends on our, and\nour third-party vendors',\nability to adapt and develop\nproducts, services and\ntechnology to rapidly\nevolving industry standards\nand consumer preferences. In\nparticular, the emergence of\nthe pandemic has resulted in\nincreased reliance on\ndigital banking and other\ndigital services provided by\nthe Corporation\u2019s\nbusinesses. There is\nincreasing pressure by\ncompetitors to provide\nproducts and services on\nmore attractive terms,\nincluding higher interest\nrates on deposits, and offer\nlower cost investment\nstrategies, which may impact\nour ability to grow revenue\nand/or effectively compete.\nAdditionally, legislative\nand regulatory developments\nmay affect the competitive\nlandscape. Further, the\ncompetitive landscape may be\nimpacted by the growth of\nnon-depository institutions\nthat offer traditional\nbanking products at higher\nrates or with low or no\nfees, or otherwise offer\nalternative products. This\ncan reduce our net interest\nmargin and revenues from our\nfee-based products and\nservices, either from a\ndecrease in the volume of\ntransactions or through a\ncompression of spreads.\n\nIn addition, the widespread\nadoption and rapid evolution\nof new technologies,\nincluding analytic\ncapabilities, self-service\ndigital trading platforms,\ninternet services,\ndistributed ledgers, such as\nthe blockchain system,\ncryptocurrencies and payment\nsystems, could require\nsubstantial expenditures to\nmodify or adapt our existing\nproducts and services as we\ngrow and develop our online\nand mobile banking channel\nstrategies in\n                                                         \n  Bank of America20                                      \n                                                         \naddition to remote\nconnectivity solutions. We\nmay not be as timely or\nsuccessful in developing or\nintroducing new products and\nservices, integrating new\nproducts or services into\nour existing offerings,\nresponding or adapting to\nchanges in consumer\nbehavior, preferences,\nspending, investing and/or\nsaving habits, achieving\nmarket acceptance of our\nproducts and services,\nreducing costs in response\nto pressures to deliver\nproducts and services at\nlower prices or sufficiently\ndeveloping and maintaining\nloyal customers. The\nCorporation\u2019s or its third-\nparty vendors' inability to\nadapt products and services\nto evolving industry\nstandards and consumer\npreferences could result in\nservice disruptions and harm\nour business and adversely\naffect our results of\noperations and reputation.\n\nWe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial\nharm if our models and\nstrategies fail to properly\nanticipate and manage risk.\n\nWe use proprietary models\nand strategies extensively\nto forecast losses, project\nrevenue, measure and assess\ncapital requirements for\ncredit, country, market,\noperational and strategic\nrisks and assess and control\nour operations and financial\ncondition. Model risk\nmanagement is a dedicated\nand independent risk\nfunction that defines model\nrisk governance, policy and\nguidelines for the\nCorporation based on laws,\nrules and regulations, as\nwell as internal\nrequirements. Under the\nCorporation's Enterprise\nModel Risk Policy, model\nrisk management is required\nto perform model oversight,\nincluding independent\nvalidation before initial\nuse, ongoing monitoring\nthrough outcomes analysis\nand benchmarking, and\nperiodic revalidation.\nModels are subject to\ninherent limitations due to\nthe use of historical trends\nand simplifying assumptions,\nuncertainty regarding\neconomic and financial\noutcomes, and emerging risks\nfrom the use of applications\nthat rely on AI.\n\nOur models and strategies\nmay not be sufficiently\npredictive of future results\ndue to limited historical\npatterns, extreme or\nunanticipated market\nmovements or customer\nbehavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe\nmarket downturns or stress\nevents, which could limit\ntheir effectiveness. The\nmodels that we use to assess\nand control our market risk\nexposures also reflect\nassumptions about the degree\nof correlation among prices\nof various asset classes or\nother market indicators,\nwhich may not be\nrepresentative of the next\ndownturn and would magnify\nthe limitations inherent in\nusing historical data to\nmanage risk. Our models may\nnot be effective if we fail\nto properly oversee them and\ndetect their flaws during\nour review and monitoring\nprocesses, they contain\nerroneous data, assumptions,\nvaluations, formulas or\nalgorithms or our\napplications running the\nmodels do not perform as\nexpected. Regardless of the\nsteps we take to ensure\neffective controls,\ngovernance, monitoring and\ntesting, and implement new\n\ntechnology and automated\nprocesses, we could suffer\noperational, reputational\nand financial harm if models\nand strategies fail to\nproperly anticipate and\nmanage current and evolving\nrisks.\n\nFailure to properly manage\nand aggregate data may\nresult in our inability to\nmanage risk and business\nneeds, errors in our day-to-\nday operations, critical\nreporting and strategic\ndecision-making and\ninaccurate reporting.\n\nWe rely on our ability to\nmanage, surveil, aggregate,\ninterpret and use data in an\naccurate, timely and\ncomplete manner for\neffective risk reporting and\nmanagement. Our policies,\nprograms, processes and\npractices govern how data is\nsurveilled, managed,\naggregated, interpreted and\nused. While we continuously\nupdate our policies,\nprograms, processes and\npractices and implement\nemerging technologies, such\nas\n\nautomation, AI and robotics,\nour data management and\naggregation processes are\nsubject to failure,\nincluding human error,\nsystem failure or failed\ncontrols. Failure to\nsurveil, maintain and manage\ndata and information\neffectively and to aggregate\ndata and information in an\naccurate, timely and\ncomplete manner may impact\nits quality and reliability\nand limit our ability to\nmanage current and emerging\nrisk, to produce accurate\nfinancial, regulatory and\noperational reporting, as\nwell as to manage changing\nbusiness needs, strategic\ndecision-making and day-to-\nday operations. The failure\nto establish and maintain\neffective, efficient and\ncontrolled data management\ncould adversely impact our\nability to develop our\nproducts and relationships\nwith our customers and\ndamage our reputation.\n\nOur operations, businesses\nand customers could be\nmaterially adversely\naffected by the impacts\nrelated to climate change.\n\nThere is an increasing\nconcern over the risks of\nclimate change and related\nenvironmental sustainability\nmatters. The physical risks\nof climate change include\nrising average global\ntemperatures, rising sea\nlevels and an increase in\nthe frequency and severity\nof extreme weather events\nand natural disasters,\nincluding floods, wildfires,\nhurricanes and tornados.\nSuch disasters could disrupt\nour operations or the\noperations of customers or\nthird parties on which we\nrely. Such disasters could\nresult in market volatility\nor negatively impact our\ncustomers\u2019 ability to pay\noutstanding loans, damage\ncollateral or result in the\ndeterioration of the value\nof collateral or insurance\nshortfalls. Additionally,\nclimate change concerns\ncould result in transition\nrisk. Changes in consumer\npreferences and additional\nlegislation and regulatory\nrequirements, including\nthose associated with the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy, could increase\nexpenses or otherwise\nadversely impact the\nCorporation, its businesses\nor its customers. We could\nalso experience increased\nexpenses resulting from\nstrategic planning,\nlitigation and technology\nand market changes, and\nreputational harm as a\nresult of negative public\nsentiment, regulatory\nscrutiny and reduced\ninvestor and stakeholder\nconfidence due to our\nresponse to climate change\nand our climate change\nstrategy.\n\nOur ability to attract and\nretain qualified employees\nis critical to our success,\nbusiness prospects and\ncompetitive position.\n\nOur performance is heavily\ndependent on the talents and\nefforts of highly skilled\nindividuals. Competition for\nqualified personnel within\nthe financial services\nindustry and from businesses\noutside the financial\nservices industry is\nintense.\n\nOur competitors include\nnon-U.S. based institutions\nand institutions subject to\ndifferent compensation and\nhiring regulations than\nthose imposed on U.S.\ninstitutions and financial\ninstitutions.\n\nIn order to attract and\nretain qualified personnel,\nwe must provide market-level\ncompensation.

Due to\neconomic uncertainty\nresulting from the\nCoronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19) pandemic (the\npandemic), the Federal\nReserve required all large\nbanks to update and resubmit\ntheir capital plans in\nNovember 2020 based on the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s updated\nsupervisory stress test\nscenarios. The results of\nthe additional supervisory\nstress tests were published\nin December 2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also\nrequired large banks to\nsuspend share repurchase\nprograms during the second\nhalf of 2020, except for\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans, and to\nlimit common stock dividends\nto existing rates that did\nnot exceed the average of\nthe last four quarters\u2019 net\nincome. In December 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve\nannounced that beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nlarge banks would be\npermitted to pay common\nstock dividends at existing\nrates and to repurchase\nshares in an amount that,\nwhen combined with dividends\npaid, does not exceed the\naverage of net income over\nthe last four quarters.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, we\nannounced that the Board of\nDirectors (the Board)\ndeclared a quarterly common\nstock dividend of $0.18 per\nshare, payable on March 26,\n2021 to shareholders of\nrecord as of March 5, 2021.\nWe also announced that the\nBoard authorized the\nrepurchase of $2.9 billion\nin common stock through\nMarch 31, 2021, plus\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans during\nthe same period, estimated\nto be approximately $300\nmillion. This authorization\nequals the maximum amount\nallowed by the Federal\nReserve for the period.

In an attempt to\ncontain the spread and\nimpact of the pandemic,\ntravel bans and\nrestrictions, quarantines,\nshelter-in-place orders and\nother limitations on\nbusiness activity were\nimplemented. Additionally,\nthere has been a decline in\nglobal economic activity,\nreduced U.S. and global\neconomic output and a\ndeterioration in\nmacroeconomic conditions in\nthe U.S. and globally. This\nhas\n\nresulted in, among other\nthings, higher rates of\nunemployment and\nunderemployment and caused\nvolatility and disruptions\nin the global financial\nmarkets, including the\nenergy and commodity\nmarkets. Although vaccines\nhave been approved for\nimmunization against\nCOVID-19 in certain\ncountries and restrictive\nmeasures have been eased in\ncertain areas, COVID-19\ncases have significantly\nincreased in recent months\nin the U.S. and many regions\nof the world compared to\nearlier levels. Businesses,\nmarket participants, our\ncounterparties and clients,\nand the U.S. and global\neconomies have been\nnegatively impacted and are\nlikely to be so for an\nextended period of time, as\nthere remains significant\nuncertainty about the timing\nand strength of an economic\nrecovery.\n\nTo address the economic\nimpact in the U.S., in March\nand April 2020, four\neconomic stimulus packages\nwere enacted to provide\nrelief to businesses and\nindividuals, including the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (CARES\nAct). Among other measures,\nthe CARES Act established\nthe Small Business\nAdministration (SBA)\nPaycheck Protection Program\n(PPP), which provides loans\nto small businesses to keep\ntheir employees on payroll\nand make other eligible\npayments. The original\nfunding for the PPP under\nthe CARES Act was fully\nallocated by mid-April 2020,\nwith additional funding made\navailable on April 24, 2020\nunder the Paycheck\nProtection Program and\nHealth Care Enhancement Act.\nIn December 2020, an\nadditional economic stimulus\npackage was included as part\nof the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act of 2021\n(the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act), which\nprovides relief to\nindividuals and businesses.\nThis relief included\nadditional funding for the\nPPP under the Economic Aid\nto Hard-Hit Small\nBusinesses, Nonprofits, and\nVenues Act (the Economic Aid\nAct).\n\nIn response to the pandemic,\nthe Corporation has\nimplemented protocols and\nprocesses to execute its\nbusiness continuity plans\nand help protect its\nemployees and support its\nclients. The Corporation is\nmanaging its response to the\npandemic according to its\nEnterprise Response\nFramework, which invokes\ncentralized management of\nthe crisis event and the\nintegration of its response.\nThe CEO and key members of\nthe Corporation\u2019s management\nteam meet regularly with co-\nleaders of the Executive\nResponse Team, which is\ncomposed of senior\nexecutives across the\nCorporation, to help drive\ndecisions, communications\nand consistency of response\nacross all businesses and\nfunctions. We are also\ncoordinating with global,\nregional and local\nauthorities and health\nexperts, including the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) and the\nWorld Health Organization.\n\nAdditionally, we have\nimplemented a number of\nmeasures to assist our\nemployees, clients and the\ncommunities we serve as\ndiscussed below.\n                                                         \n  Employees                                              \n                                                         \nWe are providing support to\nour teammates to help\npromote the health and\nsafety of our employees and\nhelp to ensure our protocols\nremain aligned to current\nguidance by monitoring\nguidance from the CDC,\nmedical boards and health\nauthorities and sharing such\nguidance with our employees.\nWe are also operating our\nbusinesses from remote\nlocations and leveraging our\nbusiness continuity plans\nand capabilities.\n\nThe Corporation has globally\nimplemented a work-from-home\nposture, which has resulted\nin the substantial majority\nof our employees working\nfrom home, and pre-planned\ncontingency strategies for\nsite-based operations for\nour remaining employees.

Based on guidance\nin the CARES Act that the\nCorporation adopted,\nCOVID-19 related\nmodifications to consumer\nand commercial loans that\nwere current as of December\n31, 2019 are exempt from\ntroubled debt restructuring\n(TDR) classification under\naccounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the\nUnited States of America\n(GAAP). In addition, the\nbank regulatory agencies\nissued interagency guidance\nstating that COVID-19\nrelated short-term\nmodifications (i.e., six\nmonths or less) granted to\nconsumer or commercial loans\nthat were current as of the\nloan modification program\nimplementation date are not\nTDRs. In December 2020, the\nConsolidated Appropriations\nAct amended the CARES Act by\nextending the exemption from\nTDR classification for\nCOVID-19 related\nmodifications from December\n31, 2020 to the earlier of\nJanuary 1, 2022 or 60 days\nafter the national emergency\nhas ended.

A\nsignificant portion of\ndeferrals expired during the\nsecond half of 2020,\nreflecting a decline in\ncustomer requests for\nassistance.

The continuation of\nall British Pound Sterling,\nEuro, Swiss Franc and\nJapanese Yen LIBOR settings\nand one-week and two-month\nU.S. dollar LIBOR settings\non the current basis are\nexpected to terminate at the\nend of December 2021, and\nthe remaining U.S. dollar\nLIBOR settings (i.e.,\novernight, one month, three\nmonth, six month and 12\nmonth) are expected to\nterminate at the end of June\n2023.\n\nAs a result of this and\nother announcements,\nfinancial benchmark reforms,\nregulatory guidance and\nchanges in short-term\ninterbank lending markets\nmore generally, a major\ntransition is in progress in\nglobal financial markets\nwith respect to the\nreplacement of IBORs and\ncertain benchmarks. The\ntransition of IBORs to ARRs\nis a complex process\nimpacting a variety of\nglobal financial markets and\nour business and operations.\n\nIBORs are used in many of\nthe Corporation\u2019s products\nand contracts, including\nderivatives, consumer and\ncommercial loans, mortgages,\nfloating-rate notes and\nother adjustable-rate\nproducts and financial\ninstruments. The\ndiscontinuation of IBORs\nrequires us to transition a\nsignificant number of IBOR-\nbased products and\ncontracts, including related\nhedging arrangements. In\nresponse, the Corporation\nestablished an enterprise-\nwide IBOR transition program\nled by senior management in\nearly 2018. This program,\nwhich is led by the\nCorporation's Chief\nOperating Officer, includes\nactive involvement of senior\nmanagement and regular\nreports to the Enterprise\nRisk Committee (ERC). The\nprogram is intended to\naddress the Corporation's\nindustry and regulatory\nengagement, client and\nfinancial contract changes,\ninternal and external\ncommunications, technology\nand operations\nmodifications,\n                                                         \n  Bank of America26                                      \n                                                         \nintroduction of new\nproducts, migration of\nexisting clients, and\nprogram strategy and\ngovernance. In addition, the\nprogram is designed to\nmonitor a variety of\nscenarios, including\noperational risks associated\nwith insufficient\npreparation by individual\nmarket participants or the\noverall market ecosystem,\nvolatility along the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate\n(SOFR) curve, development\nand adoption of credit-\nsensitive and other rates,\nregulatory and legal\nuncertainty with respect to\nvarious matters including\ncontract continuity, access\nby market participants to\nliquidity in certain\nproducts, and IBOR\ncontinuity beyond December\n2021. As of February 1,\n2021, a significant majority\nof the aggregate notional\namount of our LIBOR-based\nproducts and contracts\nmaturing after 2021 include\nor have been updated to\ninclude fallbacks to ARRs\nbased on market driven\nprotocols, regulatory\nguidance and industry-\nrecommended fallback\nprovisions and related\nmechanisms. For certain of\nthe remaining products and\ncontracts, the transition\nwill be more complex,\nparticularly where there is\nno industry-wide protocol or\nsimilar mechanism. The\nCorporation is executing\ntransition plans that are\nintended to be in line with\napplicable major industry-\nwide IBOR product cessation\nand launch milestones\nrecommended by the\nAlternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a group of\nprivate market participants\nand official sector entities\nconvened by the Federal\nReserve and the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York,\nand the Bank of England\nSterling Risk Free Rate\nWorking Group, other than\nthe cessation of LIBOR-based\nadjustable-rate consumer\nmortgages. The Corporation\nplans to no longer offer\nthese mortgages and launch\nSOFR-based adjustable-rate\nconsumer mortgages by the\nend of the first quarter of\n2021. The Corporation is\nexecuting product and client\nroadmaps that it believes\nalign with industry-\nrecommended and regulatory\nmilestones, and the\nCorporation has developed\nemployee training programs\nas well as other internal\nand external sources of\ninformation on the various\nchallenges and opportunities\nthat the replacement of\nIBORs presents. As the\ntransition to ARRs evolves,\nthe Corporation continues to\nmonitor and participate in\nthe development and usage of\ncertain ARRs, including\nSOFR, the Euro Short Term\nRate and the Sterling\nOvernight Index Average\n(SONIA). The Corporation\u2019s\nkey transition efforts to\ndate include issuances of\ndebt and deposits linked to\nSOFR and SONIA by the\nCorporation, facilitating\ndebt issuances linked to\nARRs by clients and\nsecondary market liquidity\nfor products linked to ARRs,\noriginating and arranging\nloans linked to ARRs,\nincluding hedging\narrangements, executing,\ntrading, market making and\nclearing ARR-based\nderivatives, and launching\ncapabilities and services to\nsupport the issuance and\ntrading in products indexed\nto certain ARRs. The\nCorporation updated its\noperational models, systems,\nprocedures and internal\ninfrastructure in connection\nwith the transition to ARRs\nby the central clearing\ncounterparties.

As\nthe global economic impact\nof the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal\nfrom the EU remains\nuncertain and could result\nin regional and global\nfinancial market\ndisruptions, we continue to\nassess potential\noperational, regulatory and\nlegal risks.

The decline\nin net income was primarily\ndue to higher provision for\ncredit losses driven by the\nweaker economic outlook\nrelated to COVID-19 and\nlower net interest income.\nFor discussion and analysis\nof our consolidated and\nbusiness segment results of\noperations for 2019 compared\nto 2018, see the Financial\nHighlights and Business\nSegment Operations sections\nin the MD&A of the\nCorporation's 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Net\nInterest Income Net interest\nincome decreased $5.5\nbillion to $43.4 billion in\n2020 compared to 2019. Net\ninterest yield on a fully\ntaxable-equivalent (FTE)\nbasis decreased 53 basis\npoints (bps) to 1.90 percent\nfor 2020. The decrease in\nnet interest income was\nprimarily driven by lower\ninterest rates, partially\noffset by reduced deposit\nand funding costs, the\ndeployment of excess\ndeposits into securities and\nan additional day of\ninterest accrual. Assuming\ncontinued economic\nimprovement and based on the\nforward interest rate curve\nas of January 19, 2021, when\nwe announced quarterly and\nannual results for the\nperiods ended December 31,\n2020, we expect net interest\nincome to be higher in the\nsecond half of 2021 as\ncompared to both the second\nhalf of 2020 and the first\nhalf of 2021.

2020 rate also included\nthe impact of the U.K. tax\nlaw change, whereby on July\n22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a\nrepeal of the final two\npercent of scheduled\ndecreases in the U.K.\ncorporation tax rate, which\nhad been previously enacted.\nThis change will unfavorably\naffect income tax expense on\nfuture U.K.\n\nearnings, and requires a\nreversal of the adjustment\nto the U.K. net deferred

We believe that\npresentation of these items\non an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from\nboth taxable and tax-exempt\nsources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key\nperformance indicators and\nratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation\nadjustment (DVA) gains\n(losses)) which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that the\npresentation of measures\nthat exclude these items is\nuseful because such measures\nprovide additional\ninformation to assess the\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow\nbetter comparison of period-\nto-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our\nbusiness based on certain\nratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. Tangible equity\nrepresents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced\nby goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage\nservicing rights (MSRs)),\nnet of related deferred tax\nliabilities (\"adjusted\"\nshareholders' equity or\ncommon shareholders'\nequity). These measures are\nused to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition,\nprofitability, relationship\nand investment models use\nboth return on average\ntangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity and\nreturn on average tangible\n\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key\nmeasures to support our\noverall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are as follows:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\nmeasures our net income\napplicable to common\nshareholders as a percentage\nof adjusted average common\nshareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible\nassets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders' equity\nmeasures our net income as a\npercentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019\nequity. The tangible equity\nratio represents adjusted\nending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible\nassets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per\ncommon share represents\nadjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided\nby ending common shares\noutstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing\ntangible equity provide\nadditional useful\ninformation because they\npresent measures of those\nassets that can generate\nincome. Tangible book value\nper common share provides\nadditional useful\ninformation about the level\nof tangible assets in\nrelation to outstanding\nshares of common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned\nsupplemental data and\nperformance measures are\npresented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures to\nthe corresponding GAAP\nfinancial measures, see Non-\nGAAP Reconciliations on page\n88.\n                                                         \n  Key Performance Indicators                             \n                                                         \nWe present certain key\nfinancial and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that\nmanagement uses when\nassessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We\nbelieve they are useful to\ninvestors because they\nprovide additional\ninformation about our\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends.\nThese key performance\nindicators (KPIs) may not be\ndefined or calculated in the\nsame way as similar KPIs\nused by other companies.

Net interest\nincome decreased $3.5\nbillion to $24.7 billion\n\nprimarily due to lower\nrates, partially offset by\nthe benefit of higher\ndeposit and loan balances.\nNoninterest income decreased\n$1.9 billion to $8.6 billion\ndriven by a decline in\nservice charges primarily\ndue to higher deposit\nbalances and lower card\nincome due to decreased\nclient activity, as well as\nlower other income due to\nthe allocation of asset and\nliability management (ALM)\nresults.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses increased $2.0\nbillion to $5.8 billion\nprimarily due to the weaker\neconomic outlook related to\nCOVID-19. Noninterest\nexpense increased $1.2\nbillion to $18.9 billion\nprimarily driven by\nincremental expense to\nsupport customers and\nemployees during the\npandemic, as well as the\ncost of increased client\nactivity and continued\ninvestments for business\ngrowth, including the\nmerchant services platform.\n\nThe return on average\nallocated capital was 17\npercent, down from 35\npercent, driven by lower net\nincome and, to a lesser\nextent, an increase in\nallocated capital.

Net\ninterest income declined\n$3.2 billion to $13.7\nbillion primarily due to\nlower interest rates,\npartially offset by the\nbenefit of growth in\ndeposits. Noninterest income\ndecreased $1.3 billion to\n$3.7 billion primarily\ndriven by lower service\ncharges due to higher\ndeposit balances and lower\nclient activity related to\nthe impact of COVID-19, as\nwell as lower other income\ndue to the allocation of ALM\nresults. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $110\nmillion to $379 million in\n2020 due to the weaker\neconomic outlook related to\nCOVID-19.

Management uses\nthese metrics, and we\nbelieve they are useful to\ninvestors because they\nprovide additional\ninformation about loan\ngrowth and profitability.\n                                                         \n  Key Statistics \u2013                                       \n  Consumer Lending                                       \n  (Dollars in                  2020             2019     \n  millions)                                              \n  Total credit                                           \n  card(1)                                                \n  Gross interest              10.27  %         10.76  %  \n  yield(2)                                               \n  Risk-adjusted                9.16             8.28     \n  margin(3)                                              \n  New accounts (in            2,505            4,320     \n  thousands)                                             \n  Purchase volumes       $  251,599       $  277,852     \n  Debit card purchase    $  384,503       $  360,672     \n  volumes                                                \n                                                         \n(1) Includes GWIM's credit\ncard portfolio.

Total\ncredit card purchase volumes\ndeclined $26.3 billion to\n$251.6 billion. The decline\nin credit card purchase\nvolumes was driven by the\nimpact of COVID-19.

balances managed\nunder advisory and/or\ndiscretion of GWIM are AUM\nand are typically held in\ndiversified portfolios. Fees\nearned on AUM are calculated\nas a percentage of clients\u2019\nAUM balances. The asset\nmanagement fees charged to\nclients per year depend on\nvarious factors, but are\ncommonly driven by the\nbreadth of the client\u2019s\nrelationship. The net client\nAUM flows\n\nrepresent the net change in\nclients\u2019 AUM balances over a\nspecified period of time,\nexcluding market\nappreciation/depreciation\nand other adjustments.\n\nClient balances increased\n$302.0 billion, or 10\npercent, to $3.3 trillion at\nDecember 31, 2020 compared\nto December 31, 2019. The\nincrease in client balances\nwas primarily due to higher\nmarket valuations and\npositive client flows.\n                                                         \n  41Bank of America

Net interest income\ndecreased $1.7\n\nbillion to $9.0 billion\nprimarily driven by lower\ninterest rates, partially\noffset by higher loan and\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income of $10.0\nbillion increased $166\nmillion driven by higher\ninvestment banking fees,\npartially offset by lower\nvaluation driven adjustments\non the fair value loan\nportfolio, debt securities\nand leveraged loans, as well\nas the allocation of ALM\nresults.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses increased $4.5\nbillion to $4.9 billion\nprimarily due to the weaker\neconomic outlook related to\nCOVID-19.

Average loans and\nleases were relatively flat\nin 2020 compared to 2019.\nAverage deposits increased\n26 percent primarily due to\nclient responses to market\nvolatility, government\nstimulus and placement of\ncredit draws.

trading services and\nresearch services to\ninstitutional clients across\nfixed-income, credit,\ncurrency, commodity and\nequity businesses. Global\nMarkets product coverage\nincludes securities and\nderivative products in both\nthe primary and secondary\nmarkets. Global Markets\nprovides market-making,\nfinancing, securities\nclearing, settlement and\ncustody services globally to\nour institutional investor\nclients in support of their\ninvesting and trading\nactivities. We also work\nwith our commercial and\ncorporate clients to provide\nrisk management products\nusing interest rate, equity,\ncredit, currency and\ncommodity derivatives,\nforeign exchange, fixed-\nincome and mortgage-related\nproducts. As a result of our\nmarket-making activities in\nthese products, we may be\nrequired to manage risk in a\nbroad range of financial\nproducts including\ngovernment securities,\nequity and equity-linked\nsecurities, high-grade and\nhigh-yield corporate debt\nsecurities, syndicated\nloans, MBS, commodities and\nasset-backed securities. The\neconomics of certain\ninvestment banking and\nunderwriting activities are\nshared primarily between\nGlobal Markets and Global\nBanking under an internal\nrevenue-sharing arrangement.\nGlobal Banking originates\ncertain deal-related\ntransactions with our\ncorporate and commercial\nclients that are\n\nexecuted and distributed by\nGlobal Markets . For\ninformation on investment\nbanking fees on a\nconsolidated basis, see page\n43.\n\nThe following explanations\nfor year-over-year changes\nfor Global Markets ,\nincluding those disclosed\nunder Sales and Trading\nRevenue, are the same for\namounts including and\nexcluding net DVA. Amounts\nexcluding net DVA are a non-\nGAAP financial measure. For\nmore information on net DVA,\nsee Supplemental Financial\nData on page 31.\n\nNet income for Global\nMarkets increased $1.7\nbillion to $5.2 billion. Net\nDVA losses were $133 million\ncompared to losses of $222\nmillion in 2019. Excluding\nnet DVA, net income\nincreased $1.7 billion to\n$5.4 billion. These\nincreases were primarily\ndriven by higher revenue,\npartially offset by higher\nnoninterest expense and\nprovision for credit losses.\n\nRevenue increased $3.2\nbillion to $18.8 billion\nprimarily driven by higher\nsales and trading revenue\nand investment banking fees.\nSales and trading revenue\nincreased $2.3 billion, and\nexcluding net DVA, increased\n$2.2 billion. These\nincreases were driven by\nhigher revenue across FICC\nand Equities.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses increased $260\nmillion primarily due to the\nweaker economic outlook\nrelated to COVID-19.\nNoninterest expense\nincreased $694 million to\n                                                         \n  Bank of America44                                      \n                                                         \n$11.4 billion driven by\nhigher activity-based\nexpenses for both card and\ntrading. Average total\nassets increased $5.7\nbillion to $685.0 billion\ndriven by higher client\nbalances in Global Equities.\nYear-end total assets\ndecreased $25.2 billion to\n$616.6 billion driven by\nlower levels of inventory in\nFICC and increased hedging\nof client activity in\nEquities with derivative\ntransactions relative to\nstock positions. The return\non average allocated capital\nwas 15 percent, up from 10\npercent, reflecting higher\nnet income, partially offset\nby an increase in allocated\ncapital. Sales and Trading\nRevenue Sales and trading\nrevenue includes unrealized\nand realized gains and\nlosses on trading and other\nassets which are included in\nmarket making and similar\nactivities, net interest\nincome, and fees primarily\nfrom commissions on equity\nsecurities.

Average allocated\nassets were $763.1 billion\nand $544.3 billion for 2020\nand 2019, and year-end\nallocated assets were $977.7\nbillion and $565.4 billion\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\n\nAll Other consists of ALM\nactivities, equity\ninvestments, non-core\nmortgage loans and servicing\nactivities, liquidating\nbusinesses and certain\nexpenses not otherwise\nallocated to a business\nsegment. ALM activities\nencompass certain\nresidential mortgages, debt\nsecurities, and interest\nrate and foreign currency\nrisk management activities.\nSubstantially all of the\nresults of ALM activities\nare allocated to our\nbusiness segments. For more\ninformation on our ALM\nactivities, see Note\n\n23 \u2013 Business Segment\nInformation to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nResidential mortgage loans\nthat are held for ALM\npurposes, including interest\nrate or liquidity risk\nmanagement, are classified\nas core and are presented on\nthe balance sheet of All\nOther . During 2020,\nresidential mortgage loans\nheld for ALM activities\ndecreased $12.7 billion to\n$9.0 billion due primarily\nto loan sales. Non-core\nresidential mortgage and\nhome equity loans, which are\nprincipally runoff\nportfolios, are also held in\nAll\n                                                         \n  45Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nOther . During 2020, total\nnon-core loans decreased\n$3.0 billion to $12.6\nbillion due primarily to\npayoffs and paydowns, as\nwell as Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) loan\nconveyances and sales,\npartially offset by\nrepurchases. For more\ninformation on the\ncomposition of the core and\nnon-core portfolios, see\nConsumer Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management on page 62.\n\nThe net loss for All Other\ndecreased $949 million to a\nnet loss of $407 million,\nprimarily due to a $2.1\nbillion pretax impairment\ncharge related to the notice\nof termination of the\nmerchant services joint\nventure in 2019, partially\noffset by lower revenue and\nhigher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nRevenue decreased $1.2\nbillion primarily due to\nextinguishment losses on\ncertain structured\nliabilities, higher client-\ndriven ESG investment\nactivity, resulting in\nhigher partnership losses on\nthese tax-advantaged\ninvestments, and lower net\ninterest income, partially\noffset by a gain on sales of\nmortgage loans.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses increased $719\nmillion to $50 million from\na provision benefit of $669\nmillion in 2019, primarily\ndue to recoveries from sales\nof previously charged-off\nnon-core consumer real\nestate loans in 2019, as\nwell as the weaker economic\noutlook related to COVID-19.\n\nNoninterest expense\ndecreased $2.3 billion to\n$1.4 billion primarily due\nto the $2.1 billion pretax\nimpairment charge in 2019,\npartially offset by higher\nlitigation expense.\n\nThe income tax benefit\nincreased $589 million\nprimarily driven by the\nimpact of the U.K. tax law\nchange and a higher level of\nincome tax credits related\nto our ESG investment\nactivity, partially offset\nby the positive impact from\nthe resolution of various\ntax controversy matters in\n2019. Both years included\nincome tax benefit\nadjustments to eliminate the\nFTE treatment of certain tax\ncredits recorded in Global\nBanking .\nOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements and Contractual\nObligations\nWe have contractual\nobligations to make future\npayments on debt and lease\nagreements. Additionally, in\nthe normal course of\nbusiness, we enter into\ncontractual arrangements\nwhereby we\n\ncommit to future purchases\nof products or services from\nunaffiliated parties.\nPurchase obligations are\ndefined as obligations that\nare legally binding\nagreements whereby we agree\nto purchase products or\nservices with a specific\nminimum quantity at a fixed,\nminimum or variable price\nover a specified period of\ntime. Included in purchase\nobligations are vendor\ncontracts, the most\nsignificant of which include\ncommunication services,\nprocessing services and\nsoftware contracts.

During 2020\nand 2019, we contributed\n$115 million and $135\nmillion to the Plans, and we\nexpect to make $136 million\nof contributions during\n2021.

Sound\nrisk management enables us\nto serve our customers and\ndeliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed\nwell, risks can result in\nfinancial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and\ndamage to our reputation,\neach of which may adversely\nimpact our ability to\nexecute our business\nstrategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to\nrisk management with a\ndefined Risk Framework and\nan articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are\napproved annually by the ERC\nand the Board.\n\nThe seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are\nstrategic, credit, market,\nliquidity, compliance,\noperational and\nreputational.\n\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition arising\nfrom incorrect assumptions\nabout external or internal\nfactors, inappropriate\nbusiness plans, ineffective\nbusiness strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a\ntimely manner to changes in\nthe regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the\ngeographic locations in\nwhich we operate.\n\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of\nloss arising from the\ninability or failure of a\nborrower or counterparty to\nmeet its obligations.\n\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk\nthat changes in market\nconditions may adversely\nimpact the value of assets\nor liabilities, or otherwise\nnegatively impact earnings.\nMarket risk is composed of\nprice risk and interest rate\nrisk.\n\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the\ninability to meet expected\nor unexpected cash flow and\ncollateral needs while\ncontinuing to support our\nbusinesses and customers\nunder a range of economic\nconditions.\n\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the\nrisk of legal or regulatory\nsanctions, material\nfinancial loss or damage to\nthe reputation of the\nCorporation arising from the\nfailure of the Corporation\nto comply with the\nrequirements of applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations\nand our internal policies\nand procedures.\n\n\u25cf Operational risk is the\nrisk of loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed\nprocesses, people and\nsystems, or from external\nevents.\n\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the\nrisk that negative\nperceptions of the\nCorporation\u2019s conduct or\nbusiness practices may\nadversely impact its\nprofitability or operations.\n\nThe following sections\naddress in more detail the\nspecific procedures,\nmeasures and analyses of the\nmajor categories of risk.\nThis discussion of managing\nrisk focuses on the current\nRisk Framework that, as part\nof its annual review\nprocess, was approved by the\nERC and the Board.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk\nFramework, a culture of\nmanaging risk well is\nfundamental to fulfilling\nour purpose and our values\nand delivering responsible\ngrowth. It requires us to\nfocus on risk in all\nactivities and encourages\nthe necessary mindset and\nbehavior to enable effective\nrisk management, and\npromotes sound risk-taking\nwithin our risk appetite.\nSustaining a culture of\nmanaging risk well\nthroughout the organization\nis critical to our success\nand is a clear expectation\nof our executive management\nteam and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as\nthe foundation for the\nconsistent and effective\nmanagement of risks facing\nthe Corporation. The Risk\nFramework sets forth clear\nroles, responsibilities and\naccountability for the\nmanagement of risk and\nprovides a blueprint for how\nthe Board, through\ndelegation of authority to\ncommittees and executive\nofficers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated\nlimits for our activities.\n\nExecutive management\nassesses, with Board\noversight, the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business.\nManagement reviews and\napproves the strategic and\nfinancial operating plans,\nas well as the capital plan\nand Risk Appetite Statement,\nand recommends them annually\nto the Board for approval.\nOur strategic plan takes\ninto consideration return\nobjectives and financial\nresources, which must align\nwith risk capacity and risk\nappetite. Management sets\nfinancial objectives for\neach business by allocating\ncapital and setting a target\nfor return on capital for\neach business. Capital\nallocations and operating\nlimits are regularly\nevaluated as part of our\noverall governance processes\nas the businesses and the\neconomic environment in\nwhich we operate continue to\nevolve. For more information\nregarding capital\nallocations, see Business\nSegment Operations on page\n36.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk\nappetite indicates the\namount of capital, earnings\nor liquidity we are willing\nto put at risk to achieve\nour strategic objectives and\nbusiness plans, consistent\nwith applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Our risk\nappetite provides a common\nand comparable set of\nmeasures for senior\nmanagement and the Board to\nclearly indicate our\naggregate level of risk and\nto monitor whether the\nCorporation\u2019s risk profile\nremains in alignment with\nour strategic and capital\nplans. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the\nRisk Appetite Statement,\nwhich includes both\nqualitative components and\nquantitative limits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take\nrisk is limited; therefore,\nwe prioritize the risks we\ntake in order to maintain a\nstrong and flexible\nfinancial position so we can\nwithstand challenging\neconomic conditions and take\nadvantage of organic growth\nopportunities. Therefore, we\nset objectives and targets\nfor capital and liquidity\nthat are intended to permit\nus to continue to operate in\na safe and sound manner,\nincluding during periods of\nstress.\n\nOur lines of business\noperate with risk limits\n(which may include credit,\nmarket and/or operational\nlimits, as applicable) that\nalign with the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk appetite. Executive\nmanagement is responsible\nfor tracking and reporting\nperformance measurements as\nwell as any exceptions to\nguidelines or limits. The\nBoard, and its committees\nwhen appropriate, oversee\nfinancial performance,\nexecution of the strategic\nand financial operating\nplans, adherence to risk\nappetite limits and the\nadequacy of internal\ncontrols.\n\nFor a more detailed\ndiscussion of our risk\nmanagement activities, see\nthe discussion below and\npages 50 through 85.\n\nFor more information about\nthe Corporation's risks\nrelated to the pandemic, see\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors on page 7. These\nCOVID-19 related risks are\nbeing managed within our\nRisk Framework and\nsupporting risk management\nprograms.\n                                                         \n   Risk Management Governance                            \n                                                         \nThe Risk Framework describes\ndelegations of authority\nwhereby the Board and its\ncommittees may delegate\nauthority to management-\nlevel committees or\nexecutive officers. Such\ndelegations may authorize\ncertain decision-making and\napproval functions, which\nmay be evidenced in, for\nexample, committee charters,\njob descriptions, meeting\nminutes and resolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates\nthe inter-relationship among\nthe Board, Board committees\nand management committees\nthat have the majority of\nrisk oversight\nresponsibilities for the\nCorporation.\n                                                         \n  47Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nThe chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among\nthe Board, Board committees and management committees\nthat have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities\nfor the Corporation.\n                                                         \n  Board of Directors and Board Committees                \n                                                         \nThe Board is composed of 17\ndirectors, all but one of\nwhom are independent. The\nBoard authorizes management\nto maintain an effective\nRisk Framework, and oversees\ncompliance with safe and\nsound banking practices. In\naddition, the Board or its\ncommittees conduct inquiries\nof, and receive reports from\nmanagement on risk-related\nmatters to assess scope or\nresource limitations that\ncould impede the ability of\nIndependent Risk Management\n(IRM) and/or Corporate Audit\nto execute its\nresponsibilities. The Board\ncommittees discussed below\nhave the principal\nresponsibility for\nenterprise-wide oversight of\nour risk management\nactivities. Through these\nactivities, the Board and\napplicable committees are\nprovided with information on\nour risk profile and oversee\nexecutive management\naddressing key risks we\nface. Other Board\ncommittees, as described\nbelow, provide additional\noversight of specific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown\non the above chart regularly\nreports to the Board on\nrisk-related matters within\nthe committee\u2019s\nresponsibilities, which is\nintended to collectively\nprovide the Board with\nintegrated insight about our\nmanagement of enterprise-\nwide risks.\n                                                         \n  Audit Committee                                        \n                                                         \nThe Audit Committee oversees\nthe qualifications,\nperformance and independence\nof the Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting\nFirm, the performance of our\ncorporate audit function,\nthe integrity of our\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, our compliance\nwith legal and regulatory\nrequirements, and makes\ninquiries of management or\nthe Chief Audit Executive\n(CAE) to determine whether\nthere are scope or resource\nlimitations that impede the\nability of Corporate Audit\nto execute its\nresponsibilities.

These teams work\ncollaboratively in executing\ntheir respective duties.\n                                                         \n  Corporate Audit                                        \n                                                         \nCorporate Audit and the CAE\nmaintain their independence\nfrom the FLUs, IRM and other\ncontrol functions by\nreporting directly to the\nAudit Committee or the\nBoard. The CAE\nadministratively reports to\nthe CEO. Corporate Audit\nprovides independent\nassessment and validation\nthrough testing of key\nprocesses and controls\nacross the Corporation.\nCorporate Audit includes\nCredit Review which\nperiodically tests and\nexamines credit portfolios\nand processes.\n                                                         \n   Risk Management Processes                             \n                                                         \nThe Risk Framework requires\nthat strong risk management\npractices are integrated in\nkey strategic, capital and\nfinancial planning processes\nand in day-to-day business\nprocesses across the\nCorporation, with a goal of\nensuring risks are\n\nappropriately considered,\nevaluated and responded to\nin a timely manner. We\nemploy our risk management\nprocess, referred to as\nIdentify, Measure, Monitor\nand Control, as part of our\ndaily activities.\n\nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively\nmanaged, risks must be\nclearly defined and\nproactively identified.\nProper risk identification\nfocuses on recognizing and\nunderstanding key risks\ninherent in our business\nactivities or key risks that\nmay arise from external\nfactors. Each employee is\nexpected to identify and\nescalate risks promptly.\nRisk identification is an\nongoing process,\nincorporating input from\nFLUs and control functions,\ndesigned to be forward\nlooking and capture relevant\nrisk factors across all of\nour lines of business.\n\nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is\nidentified, it must be\nprioritized and accurately\nmeasured through a\nsystematic risk\nquantification process\nincluding quantitative and\nqualitative components. Risk\nis measured at various\nlevels including, but not\nlimited to, risk type, FLU,\nlegal entity and on an\naggregate basis. This\n\nrisk quantification process\nhelps to capture changes in\nour risk profile due to\nchanges in strategic\ndirection, concentrations,\nportfolio quality and the\noverall economic\nenvironment. Senior\nmanagement considers how\nrisk exposures might evolve\nunder a variety of stress\nscenarios.\n\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk\nlevels regularly to track\nadherence to risk appetite,\npolicies, standards,\nprocedures and processes. We\nalso regularly update risk\nassessments and review risk\nexposures. Through our\nmonitoring, we can determine\nour level of risk relative\nto limits and can take\naction in a timely manner.\nWe also can determine when\nrisk limits are breached and\nhave processes to\nappropriately report and\nescalate exceptions. This\nincludes requests for\napproval to managers and\nalerts to executive\nmanagement, management-level\ncommittees or the Board\n(directly or through an\nappropriate committee).\n\nControl \u2013 We establish and\ncommunicate risk limits and\ncontrols through policies,\nstandards, procedures and\nprocesses that define the\nresponsibilities and\nauthority for risk-taking.\nThe limits and controls can\nbe adjusted by the Board or\nmanagement when conditions\nor risk tolerances warrant.\nThese limits may be absolute\n(e.g., loan amount, trading\nvolume) or relative (e.g.,\npercentage of loan book in\nhigher-risk categories). Our\nlines of business are held\naccountable to perform\nwithin the established\nlimits.\n\nThe formal processes used to\nmanage risk represent a part\nof our overall risk\nmanagement process. We\ninstill a strong and\ncomprehensive culture of\nmanaging risk well through\ncommunications, training,\npolicies, procedures and\norganizational roles and\nresponsibilities.\nEstablishing a culture\nreflective of our purpose to\nhelp make our customers\u2019\nfinancial lives better and\ndelivering our responsible\ngrowth strategy is also\ncritical to effective risk\nmanagement. We understand\nthat improper actions,\nbehaviors or practices that\nare illegal, unethical or\ncontrary to our core values\ncould result in harm to the\nCorporation, our\nshareholders or our\ncustomers, damage the\nintegrity of the financial\nmarkets, or negatively\nimpact our reputation, and\nhave established protocols\nand structures so that such\nconduct risk is governed and\nreported across the\nCorporation. Specifically,\nour Code of Conduct provides\na framework for all of our\nemployees to conduct\nthemselves with the highest\nintegrity. Additionally, we\ncontinue to strengthen the\nlink between the employee\nperformance management\nprocess and individual\ncompensation to encourage\nemployees to work toward\nenterprise-wide risk goals.\n                                                         \n  49Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  Corporation-wide Stress Testing                        \n                                                         \nIntegral to our Capital\nPlanning, Financial Planning\nand Strategic Planning\nprocesses, we conduct\ncapital scenario management\nand stress forecasting on a\nperiodic basis to better\nunderstand balance sheet,\nearnings and capital\nsensitivities to certain\neconomic and business\nscenarios, including\neconomic and market\nconditions that are more\nsevere than anticipated.\nThese stress forecasts\nprovide an understanding of\nthe potential impacts from\nour risk profile on the\nbalance sheet, earnings and\ncapital, and serve as a key\ncomponent of our capital and\nrisk management practices.\nThe intent of stress testing\nis to develop a\ncomprehensive understanding\nof potential impacts of on-\nand off-balance sheet risks\nat the Corporation and how\nthey impact financial\nresiliency, which provides\nconfidence to management,\nregulators and our\ninvestors.\n                                                         \n  Contingency Planning                                   \n                                                         \nWe have developed and\nmaintain contingency plans\nthat are designed to prepare\nus in advance to respond in\nthe event of potential\nadverse economic, financial\nor market stress.

This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions\nabout external or internal\nfactors, inappropriate\nbusiness plans, ineffective\nbusiness strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a\ntimely manner to changes in\nthe regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the\ngeographic locations in\nwhich we operate, such as\ncompetitor actions, changing\ncustomer preferences,\nproduct obsolescence and\ntechnology developments. Our\nstrategic plan is consistent\nwith our risk appetite,\ncapital plan and liquidity\nrequirements and\nspecifically addresses\nstrategic risks.\n\nOn an annual basis, the\nBoard reviews and approves\nthe strategic plan, capital\nplan, financial operating\nplan and Risk Appetite\nStatement. With oversight by\nthe Board, executive\nmanagement directs the lines\nof business to execute our\nstrategic plan consistent\nwith our core operating\nprinciples and risk\nappetite. The executive\nmanagement team monitors\nbusiness performance\nthroughout the year and\nprovides the Board with\nregular progress reports on\nwhether strategic objectives\nand timelines are being met,\nincluding reports on\nstrategic risks and if\nadditional or alternative\nactions need to be\nconsidered or implemented.\nThe regular executive\nreviews focus on assessing\nforecasted earnings and\nreturns on capital, the\ncurrent risk profile,\ncurrent capital and\nliquidity requirements,\nstaffing levels and changes\nrequired to support the\nstrategic plan, stress\ntesting results, and other\nqualitative factors such as\nmarket growth rates and peer\nanalysis.\n\nSignificant strategic\nactions, such as capital\nactions, material\nacquisitions or\ndivestitures, and resolution\nplans are reviewed and\napproved by the Board. At\nthe business level,\nprocesses are in place to\ndiscuss the strategic risk\nimplications of new,\nexpanded or modified\nbusinesses, products or\nservices and other strategic\ninitiatives, and to provide\nformal review and\n\napproval where required.\nWith oversight by the Board\nand the ERC, executive\nmanagement performs similar\nanalyses throughout the year\nand evaluates changes to the\nfinancial forecast or the\nrisk, capital or liquidity\npositions as deemed\nappropriate to balance and\noptimize achieving the\ntargeted risk appetite,\nshareholder returns and\nmaintaining the targeted\nfinancial strength.\nProprietary models are used\nto measure the capital\nrequirements for credit,\ncountry, market, operational\nand strategic risks. The\nallocated capital assigned\nto each business is based on\nits unique risk profile.\nWith oversight by the Board,\nexecutive management\nassesses the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business in\napproving strategic and\nfinancial operating plans.\nThe businesses use allocated\ncapital to define business\nstrategies and price\nproducts and transactions.\n                                                         \n   Capital Management                                    \n                                                         \nThe Corporation manages its\ncapital position so that its\ncapital is more than\nadequate to support its\nbusiness activities and\naligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic\nplanning. Additionally, we\nseek to maintain safety and\nsoundness at all times, even\nunder adverse scenarios,\ntake advantage of organic\ngrowth opportunities, meet\nobligations to creditors and\ncounterparties, maintain\nready access to financial\nmarkets, continue to serve\nas a credit intermediary,\nremain a source of strength\nfor our subsidiaries, and\nsatisfy current and future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. Capital\nmanagement is integrated\ninto our risk and governance\nprocesses, as capital is a\nkey consideration in the\ndevelopment of our strategic\nplan, risk appetite and risk\nlimits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal\nCapital Adequacy Assessment\nProcess (ICAAP) on a\nperiodic basis. The ICAAP is\na forward-looking assessment\nof our projected capital\nneeds and resources,\nincorporating earnings,\nbalance sheet and risk\nforecasts under baseline and\nadverse economic and market\nconditions. We utilize\nperiodic stress tests to\nassess the potential impacts\nto our balance sheet,\nearnings, regulatory capital\nand liquidity under a\nvariety of stress scenarios.\nWe perform qualitative risk\nassessments to identify and\nassess material risks not\nfully captured in our\nforecasts or stress tests.\nWe assess the potential\ncapital impacts of proposed\nchanges to regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nManagement assesses ICAAP\nresults and provides\ndocumented quarterly\nassessments of the adequacy\nof our capital guidelines\nand capital position to the\nBoard or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review\ncapital allocated to our\nbusinesses and allocate\ncapital annually during the\nstrategic and capital\nplanning processes.

The results\nof the additional\nsupervisory stress tests\nwere published in December\n2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also\nrequired large banks to\nsuspend share repurchase\nprograms during the second\nhalf of 2020, except for\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans, and to\nlimit common stock dividends\nto existing rates that did\nnot exceed the average of\nthe last four quarters\u2019 net\nincome. The Federal\nReserve\u2019s directives\nregarding share repurchases\naligned with our decision to\nvoluntarily suspend our\ngeneral common stock\nrepurchase program during\nthe first half of 2020. The\nsuspension of our\nrepurchases did not include\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under our equity-\nbased compensation plans.\nPursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorization, we\nrepurchased $7.0 billion of\ncommon stock during 2020.\n\nIn December 2020, the\nFederal Reserve announced\nthat beginning in the first\nquarter of 2021, large banks\nwould be permitted to pay\ncommon stock dividends at\nexisting rates and to\nrepurchase shares in an\namount that, when combined\nwith dividends paid, does\nnot exceed the average of\nnet income over the last\nfour quarters.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, we\nannounced that the Board\ndeclared a quarterly common\nstock dividend of $0.18 per\nshare, payable on March 26,\n2021 to shareholders of\nrecord as of March 5, 2021.\nWe also announced that the\nBoard authorized the\nrepurchase of $2.9 billion\nin common stock through\nMarch 31, 2021, plus\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans during\nthe same period, estimated\nto be approximately $300\nmillion. This authorization\nequals the maximum amount\nallowed by the Federal\nReserve for the period.\n\nOur stock repurchase program\nis subject to various\nfactors, including the\nCorporation\u2019s capital\nposition, liquidity,\nfinancial performance and\nalternative uses of capital,\nstock trading price and\ngeneral market conditions,\nand may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may\nbe effected through open\nmarket purchases or\nprivately negotiated\ntransactions, including\nrepurchase plans that\nsatisfy the conditions of\nRule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (Exchange\nAct).\n                                                         \n  Regulatory Capital                                     \n                                                         \nAs a financial services\nholding company, we are\nsubject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including\nBasel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. Basel 3\nestablished minimum capital\nratios and buffer\nrequirements and outlined\ntwo methods of\n\ncalculating risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), the\nStandardized approach and\nthe Advanced approaches. The\nStandardized approach relies\nprimarily on supervisory\nrisk weights based on\nexposure type, and the\nAdvanced approaches\ndetermine risk weights based\non internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt\nCorrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated\nbanking entity, BANA, are\nAdvanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3\nand are required to report\nregulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and RWA under\nboth the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The\napproach that yields the\nlower ratio is used to\nassess capital adequacy\nincluding under the PCA\nframework. As of December\n31, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital\nratios for the Corporation\nwere lower under the\nStandardized approach.\n                                                         \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                           \n                                                         \nIn order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments, the Corporation\nmust meet risk-based capital\nratio requirements that\ninclude a capital\nconservation buffer greater\nthan 2.5 percent, plus any\napplicable countercyclical\ncapital buffer and a G-SIB\nsurcharge. On October 1,\n2020, the capital\nconservation buffer was\nreplaced by the SCB for the\nCorporation\u2019s Standardized\napproach ratio requirements.\nThe buffers and surcharge\nmust be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital.\n\nThe Corporation is also\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0\npercent plus a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments. Our insured\ndepository institution\nsubsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0\npercent SLR to be considered\nwell capitalized under the\nPCA framework. The numerator\nof the SLR is quarter-end\nBasel 3 Tier 1 capital.

Total capital\nunder the Standardized\napproach increased $16.7\nbillion primarily driven by\nthe same factors as CET1\ncapital, an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for\ncredit\n\nlosses included in Tier 2\ncapital and the issuance of\npreferred stock. RWA under\nthe Standardized approach,\nwhich yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at December\n31, 2020, decreased $13.7\nbillion during 2020 to\n$1,480 billion primarily due\nto lower commercial

The\ncountercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC\nsupplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum\nconsists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage\nbuffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be\ncomprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital,\nrespectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is\ncomprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent\nrequirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure\nregulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to\ncalculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the\nStandardized approach as of both December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020\nreflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury\nSecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n(6) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the\nstandardized approach for measuring counterparty credit\nrisk at December 31, 2020 and the current exposure method\nat December 31, 2019.\n                                                         \n  Regulatory Developments                                \n                                                         \nRevisions to Basel 3 to\nAddress Current Expected\nCredit Loss Accounting\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses to be based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate\nof lifetime ECL inherent in\nthe Corporation's relevant\nfinancial assets. For more\ninformation, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. During the first\nquarter of 2020, in\naccordance with an interim\nfinal rule issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators that was\nfinalized on August 26,\n2020, the Corporation\ndelayed for two years the\ninitial adoption impact of\nCECL on regulatory capital,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition period to phase\nout the aggregate amount of\nthe capital benefit provided\nduring 2020 and 2021 (i.e.,\na five-year transition\nperiod). During the two-year\ndelay, the Corporation will\nadd back to CET1 capital 100\npercent of the initial\nadoption impact of CECL plus\n25 percent of the cumulative\nquarterly changes in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(i.e., quarterly\ntransitional amounts). After\ntwo years, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\nquarterly transitional\namounts along with the\ninitial adoption impact of\nCECL will be phased out of\nCET1 capital over the three-\nyear period.\n                                                         \n  Stress Capital Buffer                                  \n                                                         \nOn March 4, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued a\nfinal rule that integrates\nthe annual quantitative\nassessment of the CCAR\nprogram with the buffer\nrequirements in the U.S.\nBasel 3 Final Rule. The new\napproach replaced the static\n2.5 percent capital\nconservation buffer for\nBasel 3 Standardized\napproach requirements with a\nSCB, calculated as the\ndecline in the CET1 capital\nratio under the supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario\nplus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, floored at 2.5\npercent. Based on the CCAR\n2020 supervisory stress test\nresults, the Corporation is\nsubject to a 2.5 percent SCB\nfor the period beginning\nOctober 1, 2020 and ending\non September 30, 2021.\n\nIn conjunction with this new\nrequirement, the Federal\nReserve has removed the\nannual CCAR quantitative\nobjection process beginning\nwith CCAR 2020. While the\nfinal rule continues to\nrequire that the Corporation\ndescribe its planned capital\ndistributions in its CCAR\ncapital plan, the\nCorporation is no longer\nrequired to seek prior\napproval if it makes capital\ndistributions in excess of\nthose included in its CCAR\ncapital\n\nplan. The Corporation is\ninstead subject to automatic\ndistribution limitations if\nits capital ratios fall\nbelow its buffer\nrequirements, which include\nthe SCB.\n                                                         \n  Eligible Retained Income                               \n                                                         \nOn March 17, 2020, in\nresponse to the economic\nimpact of the pandemic, the\nU.S. banking regulators\nissued an interim final rule\nthat revises the definition\nof eligible retained income\nto be based on average net\nincome over the prior four\nquarters. This change, which\nwas finalized on August 26,\n2020, more gradually phases\nin automatic distribution\nrestrictions to the extent\ncapital buffers are\nbreached.\n                                                         \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                           \n                                                         \nOn April 1, 2020, in\nresponse to the economic\nimpact of the pandemic, the\nFederal Reserve issued an\ninterim final rule to\ntemporarily exclude the on-\nbalance sheet amounts of\nU.S. Treasury securities and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from the calculation\nof supplementary leverage\nexposure for bank holding\ncompanies. The rule is\neffective for June 30, 2020\nthrough March 31, 2021\nreports. As of December 31,\n2020, temporary exclusions\nimproved the SLR by 1.0\npercent to 7.2 percent.\n\nOn May 15, 2020, the U.S.\nbanking regulators issued an\ninterim final rule that\nprovides a similar temporary\nexclusion to depository\ninstitutions, effective from\nthe beginning of the second\nquarter of 2020 through\nMarch 31, 2021; however,\ninstitutions must elect the\nrelief. Beginning in the\nthird quarter of 2020, a\ndepository institution\nelecting to apply the\nexclusion must receive\napproval from its primary\nregulator prior to making\nany capital distributions as\nlong as the exclusion is in\neffect. As of December 31,\n2020, the Corporation\u2019s\ninsured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries\nhave not elected the\nexclusion.\n                                                         \n  Paycheck Protection Program Loans                      \n                                                         \nOn April 9, 2020, in\nresponse to the economic\nimpact of the pandemic, the\nU.S. banking regulators\nissued an interim final rule\nthat, among other things,\nstipulates PPP loans, which\nare guaranteed by the SBA,\nwill receive a zero percent\nrisk weight under the Basel\n3 Advanced and Standardized\napproaches. The rule was\nlater finalized by the U.S.\nbanking regulators on\nOctober 28, 2020.

Adoption\nof SA-CCR resulted in a\ndecrease of approximately\n$15 billion in the\nCorporation\u2019s Standardized\nRWA, and a $66 billion\ndecrease in supplementary\nleverage exposure.\n                                                         \n  Swap Dealer Capital Requirements                       \n                                                         \nOn July 22, 2020, the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC) issued a\nfinal rule to establish\ncapital requirements for\nswap dealers and major swap\nparticipants that are not\nsubject to existing U.S.\nprudential regulation. Under\nthe rule, applicable\nsubsidiaries of the\nCorporation would be\npermitted to elect one of\ntwo approaches to compute\ntheir regulatory capital.\nThe first approach is a\nbank-based capital approach,\nwhich requires that firms\nmaintain CET1 capital\ngreater than or equal to 6.5\npercent of the entity\u2019s RWA\nas calculated under Basel 3,\nTotal capital greater than\nor equal to 8.0 percent of\nthe entity\u2019s RWA as\ncalculated under Basel 3 and\nTotal capital greater than\nor equal to 8.0 percent of\nthe entity\u2019s uncleared swap\nmargin. The second approach\nis based on net liquid\nassets and requires that a\nfirm maintain net capital\ngreater than or equal to 2.0\npercent of its uncleared\nswap margin. The final rule\nalso includes reporting\nrequirements. The impact on\nthe Corporation is not\nexpected to be significant.\n                                                         \n  Deduction of Unsecured Debt of G-SIBs                  \n                                                         \nOn October 20, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve, Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (U.S. Agencies)\nfinalized a rule requiring\nAdvanced approaches\ninstitutions to deduct from\nregulatory capital certain\ninvestments in TLAC-eligible\nlong-term debt and other\npari passu or subordinated\ndebt instruments issued by\nG-SIBs above a specified\nthreshold. The final rule is\nintended to limit the\ninterconnectedness between\nG-SIBs and is complementary\nto existing regulatory\ncapital requirements that\ngenerally require banks to\ndeduct investments in the\nregulatory capital of\nfinancial institutions. The\nfinal rule is effective\nApril 1, 2021. The impact to\nthe Corporation is not\nexpected to be significant.\n                                                         \n  Volcker Rule                                           \n                                                         \nEffective January 1, 2020,\nwe became subject to certain\nchanges to the Volcker Rule,\nincluding removing the\nrequirement for banking\norganizations to deduct from\nTier 1 capital ownership\ninterests of covered funds\nacquired or retained under\nthe underwriting or market-\nmaking exemptions of the\nVolcker Rule, which the\nbanking entity did not\norganize or offer.\n                                                         \n  Single-Counterparty Credit Limits                      \n                                                         \nThe Federal Reserve\nestablished single-\ncounterparty credit limits\n(SCCL) for BHCs with total\nconsolidated assets of $250\nbillion or more. The SCCL\nrule is designed to ensure\nthat the maximum possible\nloss that a BHC could incur\ndue to the default of a\nsingle counterparty or a\ngroup of connected\ncounterparties would not\nendanger the BHC\u2019s survival,\nthereby reducing the\nprobability of future\nfinancial crises. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2020, G-SIBs must\ncalculate SCCL on a daily\nbasis by dividing the\naggregate net credit\nexposure to a given\ncounterparty by the G-SIB\u2019s\nTier 1 capital, ensuring\nthat exposures to other\nG-SIBs\n\nand nonbank financial\ninstitutions regulated by\nthe Federal Reserve do not\nbreach 15 percent of Tier 1\ncapital and exposures to\nmost other counterparties do\nnot breach 25 percent of\nTier 1 capital.

To\nachieve that objective, we\nanalyze and monitor our\nliquidity risk under\nexpected and stressed\nconditions, maintain\nliquidity and access to\ndiverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit\nbase, and seek to align\nliquidity-related incentives\nand risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices\nhave allowed us to\neffectively manage the\nmarket stress from the\npandemic that began in the\nfirst quarter of 2020. For\nmore information on the\neffects of the pandemic, see\nPart I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Coronavirus\nDisease on page 7 and\nExecutive Summary \u2013 Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 COVID-19\nPandemic on page 25. We\ndefine liquidity as readily\navailable assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered\nsecurities that we can use\nto meet our contractual and\ncontingent financial\nobligations as those\nobligations arise. We manage\nour liquidity position\nthrough line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as\nthrough our legal entity\nfunding strategy, on both a\nforward and current\n(including intraday) basis\nunder both expected and\nstressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized\napproach to funding and\nliquidity management\nenhances our ability to\nmonitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes\naccess to funding sources,\nminimizes borrowing costs\nand facilitates timely\nresponses to liquidity\nevents. The Board approves\nour liquidity risk policy\nand the Financial\nContingency and Recovery\nPlan. The ERC establishes\nour liquidity risk tolerance\nlevels. The MRC is\nresponsible for overseeing\nliquidity risks and\ndirecting management to\nmaintain exposures within\nthe established tolerance\nlevels. The MRC reviews and\nmonitors our liquidity\nposition and stress testing\nresults, approves certain\nliquidity risk limits and\nreviews the impact of\nstrategic decisions on our\nliquidity. For more\ninformation, see Managing\nRisk on page 47. Under this\ngovernance framework, we\nhave developed certain\nfunding and liquidity risk\nmanagement practices which\ninclude: maintaining\nliquidity at the parent\ncompany and selected\nsubsidiaries, including our\nbank subsidiaries and other\nregulated entities;\ndetermining what amounts of\nliquidity are appropriate\nfor these entities based on\nanalysis of debt maturities\nand other potential cash\noutflows, including those\nthat we may experience\nduring stressed market\nconditions; diversifying\nfunding sources, considering\nour asset profile and legal\nentity structure; and\nperforming contingency\nplanning. NB Holdings\nCorporation We have\nintercompany arrangements\nwith certain key\nsubsidiaries under which we\ntransferred certain assets\nof Bank of America\nCorporation, as the parent\ncompany, which is a separate\nand distinct legal entity\nfrom our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, and agreed to\ntransfer certain additional\nparent company assets not\nneeded to satisfy\nanticipated near-term\nexpenditures, to NB Holdings\nCorporation, a wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary\n(NB Holdings). The parent\ncompany is expected to\ncontinue to have access to\nthe same flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts\nof cash necessary to service\nits debt, pay dividends and\nperform other obligations as\nit would have had if it had\nnot entered into these\narrangements and transferred\nany assets. In consideration\nfor the transfer of assets,\nNB Holdings issued a\nsubordinated note to the\nparent company in a\nprincipal\n\namount equal to the value of\nthe transferred assets. The\naggregate principal amount\nof the note will increase by\nthe amount of any future\nasset transfers. NB Holdings\nalso provided the parent\ncompany with a committed\nline of credit that allows\nthe parent company to draw\nfunds necessary to service\nnear-term cash needs. These\narrangements support our\npreferred single point of\nentry resolution strategy,\nunder which only the parent\ncompany would be resolved\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. These arrangements\ninclude provisions to\nterminate the line of\ncredit, forgive the\nsubordinated note and\nrequire the parent company\nto transfer its remaining\nfinancial assets to NB\nHoldings if our projected\nliquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that\nresolution of the parent\ncompany becomes imminent.\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and\nOther Unencumbered Assets We\nmaintain liquidity available\nto the Corporation,\nincluding the parent company\nand selected subsidiaries,\nin the form of cash and\nhigh-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our\nliquidity buffer, referred\nto as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised\nof assets that are readily\navailable to the parent\ncompany and selected\nsubsidiaries, including\nholding company, bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\neven during stressed market\nconditions. Our cash is\nprimarily on deposit with\nthe Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent,\ncentral banks outside of the\nU.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered\nsecurities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S.\nagency securities, U.S.\nagency MBS and a select\ngroup of non-U.S. government\nsecurities. We can quickly\nobtain cash for these\nsecurities, even in stressed\nconditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or\noutright sales. We hold our\nGLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the\nliquidity requirements of\nour global businesses, and\nwe consider the impact of\npotential regulatory, tax,\nlegal and other restrictions\nthat could limit the\ntransferability of funds\namong entities.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is\nprimarily driven by deposit\nand lending activity, as\nwell as securities valuation\nand net debt activity. Bank\nsubsidiaries can also\ngenerate incremental\nliquidity by pledging a\nrange of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain\nFHLBs and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window.

However,\nHQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at\nmarket value, but at a lower value that incorporates\nregulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess\nliquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is\ncalculated as the amount of a financial institution\u2019s\nunencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash\noutflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day\nperiod of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a\npercentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net\nbasis, was $584 billion and $464 billion for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the same\nperiods, the average consolidated LCR was 122 percent and\n116 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business\nflows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis\nWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in\ndetermining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to\nmaintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to\nmeet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a\nrange of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and utilize\nincorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events,\nincluding potential credit rating downgrades for the\nparent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe\nevents including potential resolution scenarios. The\nscenarios are based on our historical experience,\nexperience of distressed and failed financial\ninstitutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and\nunexpected future events. The types of potential\ncontractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in\nour scenarios may include, but are not limited to,\nupcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and\nreductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to\nsecured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals;\nincreased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities\nand letters of credit; additional collateral that\ncounterparties could call if our credit ratings were\ndowngraded; collateral and margin requirements arising\nfrom market value changes; and potential\n\nliquidity required to maintain businesses and finance\ncustomer activities. Changes in certain market factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades,\ncould negatively impact potential contractual and\ncontingent outflows and the related financial\ninstruments, and in some cases these impacts could be\nmaterial to our financial results. We consider all\nsources of funds that we could access during each stress\nscenario and focus particularly on matching available\nsources with corresponding liquidity requirements by\nlegal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to\nmanage our asset and liability profile and establish\nlimits and guidelines on certain funding sources and\nbusinesses. Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule On\nOctober 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks\nto maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-\nyear period. The final rule is intended to support the\nability of banks to lend to households and businesses in\nboth normal and adverse economic conditions and is\ncomplementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-\nterm liquidity risks. The final rule is effective July 1,\n2021. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository\ninstitutions. The Corporation expects to be in compliance\nwithin the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline\nprovided and does not expect any significant impacts to\nthe Corporation. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our\nassets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and\nunsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally\ncoordinated funding approach diversified across products,\nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups. The\nprimary benefits of our centralized funding approach\ninclude greater control, reduced funding costs, wider\nname recognition by investors and greater flexibility to\nmeet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries.\nWhere regulations, time zone differences or other\nbusiness considerations make parent company funding\nimpractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their\nown debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending\nactivities through our deposits, which were $1.80\ntrillion and $1.43 trillion at December 31, 2020 and\n2019. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer\nBanking , GWIM and Global Banking segments. These\ndeposits are diversified by clients, product type and\ngeography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are\ninsured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of\nour deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent\nsource of funding. We believe this deposit funding is\ngenerally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market\nvolatility or changes in our credit ratings than\nwholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may\nalso be financed through secured borrowings, including\ncredit card securitizations and securitizations with\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the FHA and\nprivate-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our\ntrading activities in other regulated entities are\nprimarily funded on a secured basis through securities\nlending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will\nvary based on customer activity and market conditions. We\nbelieve funding these activities in the secured financing\nmarkets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to\nchanges in our credit ratings than unsecured financing.\nRepurchase agreements are generally short-term and often\novernight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for\nfinancial institutions have occurred in prior market\ncycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or\nsignificant\n                                                         \n  Bank of America58                                      \n                                                         \nreductions in the\navailability of such\nfinancing. We manage the\nliquidity risks arising from\nsecured funding by sourcing\nfunding globally from a\ndiverse group of\ncounterparties, providing a\nrange of securities\ncollateral and pursuing\nlonger durations, when\nappropriate. For more\ninformation on secured\nfinancing agreements, see\nNote 10 \u2013 Federal Funds Sold\nor Purchased, Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-\nterm Borrowings and\nRestricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nTotal long-term debt\nincreased $22.1 billion to\n$262.9 billion during 2020,\nprimarily due to debt\nissuances and valuation\nadjustments, partially\noffset by maturities and\nredemptions. We may, from\ntime to time, purchase\noutstanding debt instruments\nin various transactions,\ndepending on market\nconditions, liquidity and\nother factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also\nmake markets in our debt\ninstruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nDuring 2020, we issued $56.9\nbillion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $43.8 billion\nof notes issued by Bank of\nAmerica Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which\nwas TLAC compliant, $4.8\nbillion of notes issued by\nBank of America, N.A. and\n$8.3 billion of other debt.\nDuring 2019, we issued $52.5\nbillion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $29.3 billion\nof notes issued by Bank of\nAmerica Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which\nwas TLAC compliant, $10.9\nbillion of notes issued by\nBank of America, N.A. and\n$12.3 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring 2020, we had total\nlong-term debt maturities\nand redemptions in the\naggregate of $47.1 billion\nconsisting of $22.6 billion\nfor Bank of America\nCorporation, $11.5 billion\nfor Bank of America, N.A.\nand $13.0 billion of other\ndebt. During 2019, we had\ntotal long-term debt\nmaturities and redemptions\nin the aggregate of $50.6\nbillion consisting of $21.1\nbillion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $19.9 billion\nfor Bank of America, N.A.\nand $9.6 billion of other\ndebt.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Bank\nof America Corporation's\nsenior notes of $191.2\nbillion included $146.6\nbillion of outstanding notes\nthat are both TLAC eligible\nand callable at least one\nyear before their stated\nmaturities. Of these senior\nnotes, $12.0 billion will be\ncallable and become TLAC\nineligible during 2021, and\n$15.3 billion, $14.6\nbillion, $11.7 billion and\n$13.2 billion will do so\nduring each of 2022 through\n2025, respectively, and\n$79.8 billion thereafter.\n\nWe issue long-term unsecured\ndebt in a variety of\nmaturities and currencies to\nachieve cost-efficient\nfunding and to maintain an\nappropriate maturity\nprofile. While the cost and\navailability of unsecured\nfunding may be negatively\nimpacted by general market\nconditions or by matters\nspecific to the financial\nservices industry or the\nCorporation, we seek to\nmitigate refinancing risk by\nactively managing the amount\nof our borrowings that we\nanticipate will mature\nwithin any month or quarter.\nWe may issue unsecured debt\nin the form of structured\nnotes for client purposes,\ncertain of which qualify as\nTLAC-eligible debt. During\n2020, we issued $7.3 billion\nof structured notes, which\nare unsecured debt\nobligations that pay\ninvestors returns linked to\nother debt or equity\nsecurities, indices,\ncurrencies or commodities.\nWe typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities\nwith derivatives and/or\ninvestments in the\nunderlying instruments, so\nthat from a funding\nperspective, the cost is\nsimilar to our other\nunsecured long-term debt. We\ncould be required to settle\ncertain structured note\nobligations for cash or\nother securities prior to\nmaturity under certain\ncircumstances, which we\nconsider for liquidity\nplanning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a\nportion of such borrowings\nwill remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or\nredemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our\nsenior and subordinated debt\nobligations contain no\nprovisions that could\ntrigger a requirement for an\nearly repayment, require\nadditional collateral\nsupport, result in changes\nto terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create\nadditional financial\nobligations upon an adverse\nchange in our credit\nratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or\nstock price.

In addition, credit\nratings may be important to\ncustomers or counterparties\nwhen we compete in certain\nmarkets and when we seek to\nengage in certain\ntransactions, including\nover-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives. Thus, it is our\nobjective to maintain high-\nquality credit ratings, and\nmanagement maintains an\nactive dialogue with the\nmajor rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks\nare opinions expressed by\nrating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of\nour obligations or\nsecurities, including long-\nterm debt, short-term\nborrowings, preferred stock\nand other securities,\nincluding asset\nsecuritizations. Our credit\nratings are subject to\nongoing review by the rating\nagencies, and they consider\na number of factors,\nincluding our own financial\nstrength, performance,\nprospects and operations as\nwell as factors not under\nour control.

The agency also\nupgraded its preferred stock\nrating for the Corporation\nby one notch to BBB and\ndowngraded its subordinated\ndebt rating for the\nCorporation by one notch to\nA-. According to Fitch,\nrating\n\nchanges under criteria\nobservation are the sole\nresult of bank rating\ncriteria changes and do not\nreflect a change in the\nunderlying fundamentals of\nthe institution.

Credit\nrisk can also arise from\noperational failures that\nresult in an erroneous\nadvance, commitment or\ninvestment of funds. We\ndefine the credit exposure\nto a borrower or\ncounterparty as the loss\npotential arising from all\nproduct classifications\nincluding loans and leases,\ndeposit overdrafts,\nderivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded\nlending commitments which\ninclude loan commitments,\nletters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees.\nDerivative positions are\nrecorded at fair value and\nassets held-for-sale are\nrecorded at either fair\nvalue or the lower of cost\nor fair value. Certain loans\nand unfunded commitments are\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option. Credit risk\nfor categories of assets\ncarried at fair value is not\naccounted for as part of the\nallowance for credit losses\nbut as part of the fair\nvalue adjustments recorded\nin earnings. For derivative\npositions, our credit risk\nis measured as the net cost\nin the event the\ncounterparties with\ncontracts in which we are in\na gain position fail to\nperform under the terms of\nthose contracts. We use the\ncurrent fair value to\nrepresent credit exposure\nwithout giving consideration\nto future mark-to-market\nchanges. The credit risk\namounts take into\nconsideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and cash\ncollateral. Our consumer and\ncommercial credit extension\nand review procedures\nencompass funded and\nunfunded credit exposures.\nFor more information on\nderivatives and credit\nextension commitments, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives and\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based\non the risk profile of the\nborrower or counterparty,\nrepayment sources, the\nnature of underlying\ncollateral, and other\nsupport given current\nevents, conditions and\nexpectations.

In\nparticular, beginning in the\nlatter portion of the first\nquarter of 2020, the\npandemic resulted in changes\nto consumer and business\nbehaviors and restrictions\non economic activity. These\nrestrictions gave rise to\nincreased unemployment and\nunderemployment, lower\nbusiness profits, increased\nbusiness closures and\nbankruptcies, fluctuations\nand disruptions to\ncommercial and consumer\nspending and markets, and\nlower global GDP, all of\nwhich negatively impacted\nour consumer and commercial\ncredit portfolio.\n                                                         \n  61Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nTo provide relief to\nindividuals and businesses\nin the U.S., economic\nstimulus packages were\nenacted throughout 2020,\nincluding the CARES Act, an\nexecutive order signed in\nAugust 2020 to establish the\nLost Wage Assistance\nProgram, and most recently,\nthe Consolidated\nAppropriations Act enacted\nin December 2020. In\naddition, U.S. bank\nregulatory agencies issued\ninteragency guidance to\nfinancial institutions that\nhave worked with and\ncontinue to work with\nborrowers affected by\nCOVID-19.\n\nTo support our customers, we\nimplemented various loan\nmodification programs and\nother forms of support\nbeginning in March 2020,\nincluding offering loan\npayment deferrals, refunding\ncertain fees, and pausing\nforeclosure sales, evictions\nand repossessions. Since\nJune 2020, we have\nexperienced a decline in the\nneed for customer assistance\nas the number of customer\naccounts and balances on\ndeferral decreased\nsignificantly. For\ninformation on the\naccounting for loan\nmodifications related to the\npandemic, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFurthermore, as COVID-19\ncases eased and initial\nrestrictions lifted, the\nglobal economy began to\nimprove. This improvement,\ncoupled with the\naforementioned relief,\nfacilitated economic\nrecovery, with unemployment\ndropping from double-digit\nhighs in the second quarter\nof 2020 and GDP\nsignificantly rebounding in\nthe third quarter of 2020.\n\nHowever, economic recovery\nremains uneven, with certain\nsectors of the economy more\nsignificantly impacted from\nthe pandemic (e.g., travel\nand entertainment). As a\nresult, we have experienced\nincreases in commercial\nreservable criticized\nutilized exposures driven by\nindustries most heavily\nimpacted by COVID-19. Also,\nwe have seen modest\nincreases in nonperforming\nloans driven by commercial\nloans and consumer real\nestate customer deferral\nactivities, though consumer\ncharge-offs remained low\nduring 2020 due to payment\ndeferrals and government\nstimulus benefits.\n\nThe pandemic and its full\nimpact on the global economy\ncontinue to be highly\nuncertain. While COVID-19\ncases have begun to ease\nfrom their January 2021\npeak, the spread of new,\nmore contagious variants\ncould impact the magnitude\nand duration of this health\ncrisis. However, ongoing\nvirus containment efforts\nand vaccination progress, as\nwell as the possibility of\nfurther government stimulus,\ncould accelerate the\nmacroeconomic recovery.

Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction\nwith experiential judgment\nare used in all aspects of\nportfolio management\nincluding underwriting,\nproduct pricing, risk\nappetite, setting credit\nlimits, and establishing\noperating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and\nbalance risks and returns.\nStatistical models are built\nusing detailed behavioral\ninformation from external\nsources such as credit\nbureaus and/or internal\nhistorical experience and\nare a component of our\nconsumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These\nmodels are used in part to\nassist in making both new\nand ongoing credit\ndecisions, as well as\nportfolio management\nstrategies, including\nauthorizations and line\nmanagement, collection\npractices and strategies,\nand determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses and allocated capital\nfor credit risk.\n                                                         \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                              \n                                                         \nWhile COVID-19 is severely\nimpacting economic activity,\nand is contributing to\nincreasing nonperforming\nloans within certain\nconsumer portfolios, it did\nnot have a significant\nimpact on consumer portfolio\ncharge-offs during 2020 due\nto payment deferrals and\ngovernment stimulus\nbenefits. However, COVID-19\ncould lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods if\nnegative economic conditions\ncontinue or worsen. During\n2020, net charge-offs\ndecreased $334 million to\n$2.7 billion primarily due\nto lower credit card losses.\n\nThe consumer allowance for\nloan and lease losses\nincreased $5.5 billion in\n2020 to $10.1 billion due to\nthe adoption of the new CECL\naccounting standard and\ndeterioration in the\neconomic outlook resulting\nfrom the impact of COVID-19.\nFor more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses\non page 76.\n\nFor more information on our\naccounting policies\nregarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status,\ncharge-offs, TDRs for the\nconsumer portfolio, as well\nas interest accrual policies\nand delinquency status for\nloan modifications related\nto the pandemic, see Note 1\n\u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans\nand Leases and Allowance for\nCredit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nTable 19 presents our\noutstanding consumer loans\nand leases, consumer\nnonperforming loans and\naccruing consumer loans past\ndue 90 days or more.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America62                                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                    \u2014    \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                    \u2014    \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                             %      \u2026    \n                                                    \u2026    \n                                                         \n(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days\nor more are fully-insured loans.

Approximately 52\npercent of the residential\nmortgage portfolio was in\nConsumer Banking and 40\npercent was in GWIM.

Of the nonperforming\nresidential mortgage loans\nat December 31, 2020, $892\nmillion, or 45 percent, were\ncurrent on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing\npast due 30 days or more\ndecreased $72 million.\n\nNet charge-offs increased\n$17 million to a net\nrecovery of $30 million in\n2020 compared to a net\nrecovery of $47 million in\n2019. This increase is due\nlargely to lower recoveries\nfrom the sales of previously\ncharged-off loans.\n\nOf the $211.7 billion in\ntotal residential mortgage\nloans outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2020, as shown\nin Table 22, 27 percent were\noriginated as interest-only\nloans. The outstanding\nbalance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans\nthat have entered the\namortization period was $5.9\nbillion, or 10 percent, at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nResidential mortgage loans\nthat have entered the\namortization period\ngenerally have experienced a\nhigher rate of early stage\ndelinquencies and\nnonperforming status\ncompared to the residential\nmortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At December 31, 2020,\n$113 million, or two percent\nof outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgages that\nhad entered\n\nthe amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or\nmore compared to $1.2\nbillion, or less than one\npercent, for the entire\nresidential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2020, $356\nmillion, or six percent, of\noutstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the\namortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $96\nmillion were contractually\ncurrent, compared to $2.0\nbillion, or one percent, for\nthe entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the\namortization period in our\ninterest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our\nwealth management clients\nand have an interest-only\nperiod of three to ten\nyears. Approximately 98\npercent of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the\namortization period will not\nbe required to make a fully-\namortizing payment until\n2022 or later.\n\nTable 23 presents\noutstandings, nonperforming\nloans and net charge-offs by\ncertain state concentrations\nfor the residential mortgage\nportfolio.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity\nloans at December 31, 2020,\n$259 million, or 40 percent,\nwere current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $237\nmillion, or 36 percent, of\nnonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more\npast due and had been\nwritten down to the\nestimated fair value of the\ncollateral, less costs to\nsell. Accruing loans that\nwere 30 days or more past\ndue decreased $32 million in\n2020.\n\nNet charge-offs increased\n$285 million to a net\nrecovery of $73 million in\n2020 compared to a net\nrecovery of $358 million in\n2019 as the prior-year\nperiod included recoveries\nfrom non-core home equity\nloan sales.\n\nOf the $34.3 billion in\ntotal home equity portfolio\noutstandings at December 31,\n2020, as shown in Table 24,\n15 percent require interest-\nonly payments. The\noutstanding balance of\nHELOCs that have reached the\nend of their draw period and\nhave entered the\namortization period was $9.2\nbillion at December 31,\n2020. The HELOCs that have\nentered the amortization\nperiod have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status when\ncompared to the HELOC\nportfolio as a whole. At\nDecember 31, 2020, $121\nmillion, or one percent of\noutstanding HELOCs that had\nentered the amortization\nperiod were accruing past\ndue 30\n\ndays or more. In addition,\nat December 31, 2020, $477\nmillion, or five percent,\nwere nonperforming. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the\namortization period in our\ninterest-only portfolio are\nprimarily post-2008 vintages\nand generally have better\ncredit quality than the\nprevious vintages that had\nentered the amortization\nperiod. We communicate to\ncontractually current\ncustomers more than a year\nprior to the end of their\ndraw period to inform them\nof the potential change to\nthe payment structure before\nentering the amortization\nperiod, and provide payment\noptions to customers prior\nto the end of the draw\nperiod.\n\nAlthough we do not actively\ntrack how many of our home\nequity customers pay only\nthe minimum amount due on\ntheir home equity loans and\nlines, we can infer some of\nthis information through a\nreview of our HELOC\nportfolio that we service\nand that is still in its\nrevolving period. During\n2020, nine percent of these\ncustomers with an\noutstanding balance did not\npay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 25 presents\noutstandings, nonperforming\nbalances and net charge-offs\nby certain state\nconcentrations for the home\nequity portfolio.

Credit card\nand other consumer loan\nmodifications generally\ninvolve a reduction in the\ncustomer\u2019s interest rate on\nthe account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment\nplan not exceeding 60\nmonths.\n\nModifications of credit card\nand other consumer loans are\nmade through programs\nutilizing direct customer\ncontact, but may also\nutilize external programs.\nAt December 31, 2020 and\n2019, our credit card and\nother consumer TDR portfolio\nwas $701 million and $679\nmillion, of which $614\nmillion and $570 million\nwere current or less than 30\ndays past due under the\nmodified terms.\n                                                         \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management           \n                                                         \nCredit risk management for\nthe commercial portfolio\nbegins with an assessment of\nthe credit risk profile of\nthe borrower or counterparty\nbased on an analysis of its\nfinancial position. As part\nof the overall credit risk\nassessment, our commercial\ncredit exposures are\nassigned a risk rating and\nare subject to approval\nbased on defined credit\napproval standards.\nSubsequent to loan\norigination, risk ratings\nare monitored on an ongoing\nbasis, and if necessary,\nadjusted to reflect changes\nin the financial condition,\ncash flow, risk profile or\noutlook of a borrower or\ncounterparty. In making\ncredit decisions, we\nconsider risk rating,\ncollateral, country,\nindustry and single-name\nconcentration limits while\nalso balancing these\nconsiderations with the\ntotal\n\nborrower or counterparty\nrelationship. We use a\nvariety of tools to\ncontinuously monitor the\nability of a borrower or\ncounterparty to perform\nunder its obligations. We\nuse risk rating aggregations\nto measure and evaluate\nconcentrations within\nportfolios. In addition,\nrisk ratings are a factor in\ndetermining the level of\nallocated capital and the\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk\nmitigation initiatives, we\nattempt to work with clients\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty to modify their\nloans to terms that better\nalign with their current\nability to pay. In\nsituations where an economic\nconcession has been granted\nto a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, we\nidentify these loans as\nTDRs. For more information\non our accounting policies\nregarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status and net\ncharge-offs for the\ncommercial portfolio, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements .\n                                                         \n   Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations   \n                                                         \nCommercial credit risk is\nevaluated and managed with\nthe goal that concentrations\nof credit exposure continue\nto be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure\nand manage concentrations of\ncredit exposure by industry,\nproduct, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size.\nWe also review, measure and\nmanage commercial real\nestate loans by geographic\nlocation and property type.\nIn addition, within our\n                                                         \n  Bank of America68                                      \n                                                         \nnon-U.S. portfolio, we\nevaluate exposures by region\nand by country. Tables 34,\n37 and 40 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also\nutilize syndications of\nexposure to third parties,\nloan sales, hedging and\nother risk mitigation\ntechniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the\ncommercial credit portfolio.\nFor more information on our\nindustry concentrations, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations on page 72\nand Table 37.\n\nWe account for certain large\ncorporate loans and loan\ncommitments, including\nissued but unfunded letters\nof credit which are\nconsidered utilized for\ncredit risk management\npurposes, that exceed our\nsingle-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines\nunder the fair value option.\nLending commitments, both\nfunded and unfunded, are\nactively managed and\nmonitored, and as\nappropriate, credit risk for\nthese lending relationships\nmay be mitigated through the\nuse of credit derivatives,\nwith our credit view and\nmarket perspectives\ndetermining the size and\ntiming of the hedging\nactivity. In addition, we\npurchase credit protection\nto cover the funded portion\nas well as the unfunded\nportion of certain other\ncredit exposures. To lessen\nthe cost of obtaining our\ndesired credit protection\nlevels, credit exposure may\nbe added within an industry,\nborrower or counterparty\ngroup by selling protection.\nThese credit derivatives do\nnot meet the requirements\nfor treatment as accounting\nhedges. They are carried at\nfair value with changes in\nfair value recorded in other\nincome.\n\nIn addition, we are a member\nof various securities and\nderivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the\nU.S. and other countries. As\na member, we may be required\nto pay a pro-rata share of\nthe losses incurred by some\nof these organizations as a\nresult of another member\ndefault and under other loss\nscenarios.

The draws by large\ncorporate\n\nand commercial clients\ncontributing to the $67.2\nbillion loan growth in the\nfirst quarter of 2020 have\nlargely been repaid, as\nemergency or contingent\nfunding was no longer needed\nor clients were able to\naccess capital markets.\nAdditionally, as part of the\nCARES Act, we had $22.7\nbillion of PPP loans\noutstanding with our small\nbusiness clients at December\n31, 2020, which are included\nin U.S. small business\ncommercial in the tables in\nthis section. For more\ninformation on PPP loans,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCredit quality of commercial\nreal estate borrowers has\nbegun to stabilize in many\nsectors as certain economies\nhave reopened. Certain\nsectors, including\nhospitality and retail,\ncontinue to be negatively\nimpacted as a result of\nCOVID-19. Moreover, many\nreal estate markets, while\nimproving, are still\nexperiencing some\ndisruptions in demand,\nsupply chain challenges and\ntenant difficulties.\n\nThe commercial allowance for\nloan and lease losses\nincreased $3.9 billion\nduring 2020 to $8.7 billion\ndue to the deterioration in\nthe economic outlook\nresulting from the impact of\nCOVID-19.

The decrease in\ncommercial committed\nexposure was concentrated in\nthe Global commercial banks,\nAsset managers and funds,\nUtilities, and Real estate\nindustry sectors.

In addition to our net notional credit default\nprotection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded\nportion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives\nare used for market-making activities for clients and\nestablishing positions intended to profit from\ndirectional or relative value changes. We execute the\nmajority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC\nmarket with large, multinational financial institutions,\nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a\nvariety of other investors. Because these transactions\nare executed in the OTC market, we are subject to\nsettlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in\nthe event that these counterparties fail to perform under\nthe terms of these contracts. In order to properly\nreflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty\ncredit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative\nassets, including our\n\npurchased credit default protection. In most cases,\ncredit derivative transactions are executed on a daily\nmargin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit\ndowngrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a\nbreach of credit covenants would typically require an\nincrease in the amount of collateral required by the\ncounterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take\nadditional protective measures such as early termination\nof all trades. For more information on credit derivatives\nand counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and\ntrading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define\ncountry risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable\neconomic and political conditions, currency fluctuations,\nsocial instability and changes in government policies. A\nrisk management framework is in place to measure, monitor\nand manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to\nthe direct risk of doing business in a country, we also\nare exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to\nthe collateral received on secured financing transactions\nor related to client clearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal course of business\nthrough credit, market and operational risk governance,\nrather than through country risk governance. Table 40\npresents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at\nDecember 31, 2020. These exposures accounted for 90\npercent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019. Net country exposure for\nthese 20 countries increased $21.2 billion in 2020. The\nmajority of the increase was due to higher deposits with\ncentral banks in Germany and Japan. Non-U.S. exposure is\npresented on an internal risk management basis and\nincludes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure,\nsecurities and other investments issued by or domiciled\nin countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan\nequivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions\nof credit and funds, including letters of credit and due\nfrom placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn\nportion of legally binding commitments related to loans\nand loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes\nthe fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty\nrisk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and\nsecured financing transactions. Securities and other\ninvestments are carried at fair value and long securities\nexposures are netted against short exposures with the\nsame underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net\ncountry exposure represents country exposure less hedges\nand credit default protection purchased, net of credit\ndefault protection sold.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America74                                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                             $      $    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                             $      $    \n                                                         \nOur largest non-U.S. country\nexposure at December 31,\n2020 was the U.K. with net\nexposure of $59.5 billion,\nwhich represents a $3.6\nbillion increase from\nDecember 31, 2019.

In the event of\nmarket stress, these risks\ncould have a material impact\non our results. For more\ninformation, see Interest\nRate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 82.\n\nWe have been affected, and\nexpect to continue to be\naffected, by market stress\nresulting from the pandemic\nthat began in the first\nquarter of 2020. For more\ninformation on the effects\nof the pandemic, see\nExecutive Summary \u2013 Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 COVID-19\nPandemic on page 25.\n\nOur traditional banking loan\nand deposit products are\nnon-trading positions and\nare generally reported at\namortized cost for assets or\nthe amount owed for\nliabilities (historical\ncost). However, these\npositions are still subject\nto changes in economic value\nbased on varying market\nconditions, with one of the\nprimary risks being changes\nin the levels of interest\nrates. The risk of adverse\nchanges in the economic\nvalue of our non-trading\npositions arising from\nchanges in interest rates is\nmanaged through our ALM\nactivities. We have elected\nto account for certain\nassets and liabilities under\nthe fair value option.\n\nOur trading positions are\nreported at fair value with\nchanges reflected in income.\nTrading positions are\nsubject to various changes\nin market-based risk\nfactors. The majority of\nthis risk is generated by\nour activities in the\ninterest rate, foreign\nexchange, credit, equity and\ncommodities markets. In\naddition, the values of\nassets and liabilities could\nchange due to market\nliquidity, correlations\nacross markets and\nexpectations of market\nvolatility. We seek to\nmanage these risk exposures\nby using a variety of\ntechniques that encompass a\nbroad range of financial\ninstruments. The key risk\nmanagement techniques are\ndiscussed in more detail in\nthe Trading Risk Management\nsection.\n\nGlobal Risk Management is\nresponsible for providing\nsenior management with a\nclear and comprehensive\nunderstanding of the trading\nrisks to which we are\nexposed. These\nresponsibilities include\nownership of market risk\npolicy, developing and\nmaintaining quantitative\nrisk models, calculating\naggregated risk measures,\nestablishing and monitoring\nposition limits consistent\nwith risk appetite,\nconducting daily reviews and\nanalysis of trading\ninventory, approving\nmaterial risk exposures and\nfulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. Market risks\nthat impact businesses\noutside of Global Markets\nare monitored and governed\nby their respective\ngovernance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential\nfor adverse consequences\nfrom decisions based on\nincorrect or misused model\noutputs and reports. Given\nthat models are used across\nthe Corporation, model risk\nimpacts all risk types\nincluding credit, market and\noperational risks. The\nEnterprise Model Risk Policy\ndefines model risk\nstandards, consistent with\nour risk framework and risk\nappetite, prevailing\nregulatory guidance and\nindustry best practice. All\nmodels, including risk\nmanagement, valuation and\nregulatory capital models,\nmust meet certain validation\ncriteria, including\neffective challenge of the\nconceptual soundness of the\nmodel, independent model\ntesting and ongoing\nmonitoring through outcomes\nanalysis and benchmarking.\nThe Enterprise Model Risk\nCommittee (EMRC), a\nsubcommittee of the MRC,\noversees that model\nstandards are consistent\nwith model risk requirements\nand monitors the effective\nchallenge in the model\nvalidation process across\nthe Corporation.\n                                                         \n  Interest Rate Risk                                     \n                                                         \nInterest rate risk\nrepresents exposures to\ninstruments whose values\nvary with the level or\nvolatility of interest\nrates. These instruments\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, loans, debt securities,\ncertain trading-related\nassets and liabilities,\ndeposits, borrowings and\nderivatives. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate\nthese risks include\nderivatives such as options,\nfutures, forwards and swaps.\n                                                         \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                                  \n                                                         \nForeign exchange risk\nrepresents exposures to\nchanges in the values of\ncurrent holdings and future\ncash flows denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nU.S. dollar. The types of\ninstruments exposed to this\nrisk include investments in\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries,\nforeign currency-denominated\nloans and securities, future\ncash flows in foreign\ncurrencies arising from\nforeign exchange\ntransactions, foreign\ncurrency-denominated debt\nand various foreign exchange\nderivatives whose values\nfluctuate with changes in\nthe level or volatility of\ncurrency exchange rates or\nnon-U.S. interest rates.\nHedging instruments used to\nmitigate this risk include\nforeign exchange options,\ncurrency swaps, futures,\nforwards, and foreign\ncurrency-denominated debt\nand deposits.\n                                                         \n  Mortgage Risk                                          \n                                                         \nMortgage risk represents\nexposures to changes in the\nvalues of mortgage-related\ninstruments. The values of\nthese instruments are\nsensitive to prepayment\nrates, mortgage rates,\nagency debt ratings,\ndefault, market liquidity,\ngovernment participation and\ninterest rate volatility.\nOur exposure to these\ninstruments takes several\nforms. For example, we trade\nand engage in market-making\nactivities in a variety of\nmortgage securities\nincluding whole loans, pass-\nthrough certificates,\ncommercial mortgages and\ncollateralized mortgage\nobligations including\ncollateralized debt\nobligations using mortgages\nas underlying collateral. In\naddition, we originate a\nvariety of MBS, which\ninvolves the accumulation of\nmortgage-related loans in\nanticipation of eventual\nsecuritization, and we may\nhold positions in mortgage\nsecurities and residential\nmortgage loans as part of\nthe ALM portfolio. We also\nrecord MSRs as part of our\nmortgage origination\nactivities. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate\nthis risk include\nderivatives such as options,\nswaps, futures and forwards\nas well as securities\nincluding MBS and U.S.\nTreasury securities. For\nmore information, see\nMortgage Banking Risk\nManagement on page 84.\n                                                         \n  Equity Market Risk                                     \n                                                         \nEquity market risk\nrepresents exposures to\nsecurities that represent an\nownership interest in a\ncorporation in the form of\ndomestic and foreign common\nstock or other equity-linked\ninstruments. Instruments\nthat would lead to this\nexposure include, but are\nnot limited to, the\nfollowing: common stock,\nexchange-traded funds,\nAmerican Depositary\nReceipts, convertible bonds,\nlisted equity options (puts\nand calls), OTC equity\noptions, equity total return\nswaps, equity index futures\nand other equity derivative\nproducts. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate\nthis risk include options,\nfutures, swaps, convertible\nbonds and cash positions.\n                                                         \n  Commodity Risk                                         \n                                                         \nCommodity risk represents\nexposures to instruments\ntraded in the petroleum,\nnatural gas, power and\nmetals markets. These\ninstruments consist\nprimarily of futures,\nforwards, swaps and options.\nHedging instruments used to\nmitigate this risk include\n                                                         \n  Bank of America78                                      \n                                                         \noptions, futures and swaps\nin the same or similar\ncommodity product, as well\nas cash positions.\n                                                         \n  Issuer Credit Risk                                     \n                                                         \nIssuer credit risk\nrepresents exposures to\nchanges in the\ncreditworthiness of\nindividual issuers or groups\nof issuers. Our portfolio is\nexposed to issuer credit\nrisk where the value of an\nasset may be adversely\nimpacted by changes in the\nlevels of credit spreads, by\ncredit migration or by\ndefaults. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate\nthis risk include bonds, CDS\nand other credit fixed-\nincome instruments.\n                                                         \n   Market Liquidity Risk                                 \n                                                         \nMarket liquidity risk\nrepresents the risk that the\nlevel of expected market\nactivity changes\ndramatically and, in certain\ncases, may even cease. This\nexposes us to the risk that\nwe will not be able to\ntransact business and\nexecute trades in an orderly\nmanner which may impact our\nresults. This impact could\nbe further exacerbated if\nexpected hedging or pricing\ncorrelations are compromised\nby disproportionate demand\nor lack of demand for\ncertain instruments. We\nutilize various risk\nmitigating techniques as\ndiscussed in more detail in\nTrading Risk Management.\n                                                         \n   Trading Risk Management                               \n                                                         \nTo evaluate risks in our\ntrading activities, we focus\non the actual and potential\nvolatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual\npositions as well as\nportfolios of positions.\nVarious techniques and\nprocedures are utilized to\nenable the most complete\nunderstanding of these\nrisks. Quantitative measures\nof market risk are evaluated\non a daily basis from a\nsingle position to the\nportfolio of the\nCorporation. These measures\ninclude sensitivities of\npositions to various market\nrisk factors, such as the\npotential impact on revenue\nfrom a one basis point\nchange in interest rates,\nand statistical measures\nutilizing both actual and\nhypothetical market moves,\nsuch as VaR and stress\ntesting. Periods of extreme\nmarket stress influence the\nreliability of these\ntechniques to varying\ndegrees. Qualitative\nevaluations of market risk\nutilize the suite of\nquantitative risk measures\nwhile understanding each of\ntheir respective\nlimitations. Additionally,\nrisk managers independently\nevaluate the risk of the\nportfolios under the current\nmarket environment and\npotential future\nenvironments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic\nused to measure market risk\nas it allows the aggregation\nof market risk factors,\nincluding the effects of\nportfolio diversification. A\nVaR model simulates the\nvalue of a portfolio under a\nrange of scenarios in order\nto generate a distribution\nof potential gains and\nlosses. VaR represents the\nloss a portfolio is not\nexpected to exceed more than\na certain number of times\nper period, based on a\nspecified holding period,\nconfidence level and window\nof historical data. We use\none VaR model consistently\nacross the trading\nportfolios and it uses a\nhistorical simulation\napproach based on a three-\nyear window of historical\ndata. Our primary VaR\nstatistic is equivalent to a\n99 percent confidence level,\nwhich means that for a VaR\nwith a one-day holding\nperiod, there should not be\nlosses in excess of VaR, on\naverage, 99 out of 100\ntrading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there\nare significant and numerous\nassumptions that will differ\nfrom company to company. The\naccuracy of a VaR model\ndepends on the availability\nand quality of historical\ndata for each of the risk\nfactors in the portfolio. A\nVaR model may require\nadditional modeling\nassumptions for new products\nthat do not have the\nnecessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid\npositions for which accurate\ndaily prices\n\nare not consistently\navailable. For positions\nwith insufficient historical\ndata for the VaR\ncalculation, the process for\nestablishing an appropriate\nproxy is based on\nfundamental and statistical\nanalysis of the new product\nor less liquid position.\nThis analysis identifies\nreasonable alternatives that\nreplicate both the expected\nvolatility and correlation\nto other market risk factors\nthat the missing data would\nbe expected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of\nrealized revenue volatility\nas changes in market\nconditions or in the\ncomposition of the portfolio\ncan have a material impact\non the results. In\nparticular, the historical\ndata used for the VaR\ncalculation might indicate\nhigher or lower levels of\nportfolio diversification\nthan will be experienced. In\norder for the VaR model to\nreflect current market\nconditions, we update the\nhistorical data underlying\nour VaR model on a weekly\nbasis, or more frequently\nduring periods of market\nstress, and regularly review\nthe assumptions underlying\nthe model. A minor portion\nof risks related to our\ntrading positions is not\nincluded in VaR. These risks\nare reviewed as part of our\nICAAP. For more information\nregarding ICAAP, see Capital\nManagement on page 50.\n\nGlobal Risk Management\ncontinually reviews,\nevaluates and enhances our\nVaR model so that it\nreflects the material risks\nin our trading portfolio.\nChanges to the VaR model are\nreviewed and approved prior\nto implementation and any\nmaterial changes are\nreported to management\nthrough the appropriate\nmanagement committees.\n\nTrading limits on\nquantitative risk measures,\nincluding VaR, are\nindependently set by Global\nMarkets Risk Management and\nreviewed on a regular basis\nso that trading limits\nremain relevant and within\nour overall risk appetite\nfor market risks. Trading\nlimits are reviewed in the\ncontext of market liquidity,\nvolatility and strategic\nbusiness priorities. Trading\nlimits are set at both a\ngranular level to allow for\nextensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated\nportfolios to account for\ncorrelations among risk\nfactors. All trading limits\nare approved at least\nannually. Approved trading\nlimits are stored and\ntracked in a centralized\nlimits management system.\nTrading limit excesses are\ncommunicated to management\nfor review. Certain\nquantitative market risk\nmeasures and corresponding\nlimits have been identified\nas critical in the\nCorporation\u2019s Risk Appetite\nStatement. These risk\nappetite limits are reported\non a daily basis and are\napproved at least annually\nby the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress,\nGlobal Markets senior\nleadership communicates\ndaily to discuss losses, key\nrisk positions and any limit\nexcesses. As a result of\nthis process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 44 presents the total\nmarket-based portfolio VaR\nwhich is the combination of\nthe total covered positions\n(and less liquid trading\npositions) portfolio and the\nfair value option portfolio.\nCovered positions are\ndefined by regulatory\nstandards as trading assets\nand liabilities, both on-\nand off-balance sheet, that\nmeet a defined set of\nspecifications. These\nspecifications identify the\nmost liquid trading\npositions which are intended\nto be held for a short-term\nhorizon and where we are\nable to hedge the material\nrisk elements in a two-way\nmarket. Positions in less\nliquid markets, or where\nthere are restrictions on\nthe ability to trade the\npositions, typically do not\nqualify as covered\npositions. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are\nalways considered covered\npositions, except for\nstructural foreign currency\npositions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory\napproval. In addition, Table\n44 presents our fair value\noption portfolio, which\nincludes substantially all\nof the funded and unfunded\nexposures for which we elect\nthe fair value option, and\ntheir corresponding hedges.\nAdditionally, market risk\nVaR for\n                                                         \n  79Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \ntrading activities as\npresented in Table 44\ndiffers from VaR used for\nregulatory capital\ncalculations due to the\nholding period being used.\nThe holding period for VaR\nused for regulatory capital\ncalculations is 10 days,\nwhile for the market risk\nVaR presented below, it is\none day.

                                              \nThe accuracy of the VaR\nmethodology is evaluated by\nbacktesting, which compares\nthe daily VaR results,\nutilizing a one-day holding\nperiod, against a comparable\nsubset of trading revenue. A\nbacktesting excess occurs\nwhen a trading loss exceeds\nthe VaR for the\ncorresponding day. These\nexcesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and\nmarket moves that produced\nthe trading loss with a goal\nto ensure that the VaR\nmethodology accurately\nrepresents those losses. We\nexpect the frequency of\ntrading losses in excess of\nVaR to be in line with the\nconfidence level of the VaR\nstatistic being tested. For\nexample, with a 99 percent\nconfidence level, we expect\none trading loss in excess\nof VaR every 100 days or\nbetween two to three trading\nlosses in excess of VaR over\nthe course of a year. The\nnumber of backtesting\nexcesses observed can differ\nfrom the statistically\nexpected number of excesses\nif the current level of\nmarket volatility is\nmaterially different than\nthe level of market\nvolatility that existed\nduring the three years of\nhistorical data used in the\nVaR calculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for\nbacktesting is defined by\nregulatory agencies in order\nto most closely align with\nthe VaR component of the\nregulatory capital\ncalculation. This revenue\ndiffers from total trading-\nrelated revenue in that it\nexcludes revenue from\ntrading activities that\neither do not generate\nmarket risk or the market\nrisk cannot be included in\nVaR. Some examples of the\ntypes of revenue excluded\nfor backtesting are fees,\ncommissions, reserves, net\ninterest income and intra-\nday trading revenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting\non the VaR results used for\nregulatory capital\ncalculations as well as the\nVaR results for key legal\nentities, regions and risk\nfactors. These results are\nreported to senior market\nrisk management. Senior\nmanagement regularly reviews\nand evaluates the results of\nthese tests.\n\nDuring 2020, there were\nseven days where this subset\nof trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our\ntotal covered portfolio VaR,\nutilizing a one-day holding\nperiod.\n                                                         \n  Total Trading-related Revenue                          \n                                                         \nTotal trading-related\nrevenue, excluding brokerage\nfees, and CVA, DVA and\nfunding valuation adjustment\ngains (losses), represents\nthe total amount earned from\ntrading positions, including\nmarket-based net interest\nincome, which are taken in a\ndiverse range of financial\ninstruments and markets. For\nmore information on fair\nvalue, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nTrading-related revenue can\nbe volatile and is largely\ndriven by general market\nconditions and customer\ndemand. Also, trading-\nrelated revenue is dependent\non the volume and type of\ntransactions, the level of\nrisk assumed, and the\nvolatility of price and rate\nmovements at any given time\nwithin the ever-changing\nmarket environment.\nSignificant daily revenue by\nbusiness is monitored and\nthe primary drivers of these\nare reviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a\ngraphic depiction of trading\nvolatility and illustrates\nthe daily level of trading-\nrelated revenue for 2020 and\n2019. During 2020, positive\ntrading-related revenue was\nrecorded for 98 percent of\nthe trading days, of which\n87 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25\nmillion, and the largest\nloss was $90 million. This\ncompares to 2019 where\npositive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for 98\npercent of the trading days,\nof which 80 percent were\ndaily trading gains of over\n$25 million, and the largest\nloss was $35 million.\n                                                         \n  Trading Portfolio Stress Testing                       \n                                                         \nBecause the very nature of a\nVaR model suggests results\ncan exceed our estimates and\nit is dependent on a limited\nhistorical window, we also\nstress test our portfolio\nusing scenario analysis.\nThis analysis estimates the\nchange in the value of our\ntrading portfolio that may\nresult from abnormal market\nmovements.\n\nA set of scenarios,\ncategorized as either\nhistorical or hypothetical,\nare computed daily for the\noverall trading portfolio\nand individual businesses.\nThese scenarios include\nshocks to underlying market\nrisk factors that may be\nwell beyond the shocks found\nin the historical data used\nto calculate VaR.

Stress testing\nfor the trading portfolio is\nintegrated with enterprise-\nwide stress testing and\nincorporated into the limits\nframework. The macroeconomic\nscenarios used for\nenterprise-wide stress\ntesting purposes differ from\nthe typical trading\nportfolio scenarios in that\nthey have a longer time\nhorizon and the results are\nforecasted over multiple\nperiods for use in\nconsolidated capital and\nliquidity planning.

Interest\nrate risk represents the\nmost significant market risk\nexposure to our banking book\nbalance sheet. Interest rate\nrisk is measured as the\npotential change in net\ninterest income caused by\nmovements in market interest\nrates. Client-facing\nactivities, primarily\nlending and deposit-taking,\ncreate interest rate\nsensitive positions on our\nbalance sheet. We prepare\nforward-looking forecasts of\nnet interest income. The\nbaseline forecast takes into\nconsideration expected\nfuture business growth, ALM\npositioning -and the\ndirection of interest rate\nmovements as implied by the\nmarket-based forward curve.\nWe then measure and evaluate\nthe impact that alternative\ninterest rate scenarios have\non the baseline forecast in\norder to assess interest\nrate sensitivity under\nvaried conditions. The net\ninterest income forecast is\nfrequently updated for\nchanging assumptions and\ndiffering outlooks based on\neconomic trends, market\nconditions and business\nstrategies. Thus, we\ncontinually monitor our\nbalance sheet position in\norder to maintain an\nacceptable level of exposure\nto interest rate changes.\nThe interest rate scenarios\nthat we analyze incorporate\nbalance sheet assumptions\nsuch as loan and deposit\ngrowth and pricing, changes\nin funding mix, product\nrepricing, maturity\ncharacteristics and\ninvestment securities\npremium amortization. Our\noverall goal is to manage\ninterest rate risk so that\nmovements in interest rates\ndo not significantly\nadversely affect earnings\nand capital.

Periodically\nwe evaluate the scenarios\npresented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of\nthe current rate\nenvironment. The interest\nrate scenarios also assume\nU.S. dollar rates are\nfloored at zero. During\n2020, the asset sensitivity\nof our balance sheet\nincreased in both up-rate\nand down-rate scenarios\nprimarily due to continued\ndeposit growth invested in\nlong-term securities. We\ncontinue to be asset\nsensitive to a parallel\nupward move in interest\nrates with the majority of\nthat impact coming from the\nshort end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates impact the\nfair value of debt\nsecurities and, accordingly,\nfor debt securities\nclassified as AFS, may\nadversely affect accumulated\nOCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital\nrules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the\nnear-term adverse impact to\nBasel 3 capital is reduced\nover time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net\ninterest income.

As part of\nour ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain\nresidential mortgages, and\ninterest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in\nmanaging interest rate\nsensitivity. The behavior of\nour deposits portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in\nalternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected\nestimates of net interest\nincome. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 47 assumes\nno change in deposit\nportfolio size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast in\nalternate rate environments.\nIn higher rate scenarios,\nany customer activity\nresulting in the replacement\nof low-cost or non-interest-\nbearing deposits with higher\nyielding deposits or market-\nbased funding would reduce\nour benefit in those\nscenarios. Interest Rate and\nForeign Exchange Derivative\nContracts Interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative\ncontracts are utilized in\nour ALM activities and serve\nas an efficient tool to\nmanage our interest rate and\nforeign exchange risk. We\nuse derivatives to hedge the\nvariability in cash flows or\nchanges in fair value on our\nbalance sheet due to\ninterest rate and foreign\nexchange components.

In addition, we\nuse foreign exchange\ncontracts, including cross-\ncurrency interest rate\nswaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign\ncurrency forward contracts\nand options to mitigate the\nforeign exchange risk\nassociated with foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets\nand liabilities.\n\nChanges to the composition\nof our derivatives portfolio\nduring 2020 reflect actions\ntaken for interest rate and\nforeign exchange rate risk\nmanagement. The decisions to\nreposition our derivatives\nportfolio are based on the\ncurrent assessment of\neconomic and financial\nconditions including the\ninterest rate and foreign\ncurrency environments,\nbalance sheet composition\nand trends, and the relative\nmix of our cash and\nderivative positions.\n\nWe use interest rate\nderivative instruments to\nhedge the variability in the\ncash flows of our assets and\nliabilities and other\nforecasted transactions\n(collectively referred to as\ncash flow hedges). The net\nresults on both open and\nterminated cash flow hedge\nderivative instruments\nrecorded in accumulated OCI\nwere a gain of $580 million\nand a loss of $496 million,\non a pretax basis, at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThese gains and losses are\nexpected to be reclassified\ninto earnings in the same\nperiod as the hedged cash\nflows affect earnings and\nwill decrease income or\nincrease expense on the\nrespective hedged\n\ncash flows. Assuming no\nchange in open cash flow\nderivative hedge positions\nand no changes in prices or\ninterest rates beyond what\nis implied in forward yield\ncurves at December 31, 2020,\nthe after-tax net gains are\nexpected to be reclassified\ninto earnings as follows: a\ngain of $187 million within\nthe next year, a gain of\n$358 million in years two\nthrough five, a loss of $59\nmillion in years six through\nten, with the remaining loss\nof $50 million thereafter.\nFor more information on\nderivatives designated as\ncash flow hedges, see Note 3\n\u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nWe hedge our net investment\nin non-U.S. operations\ndetermined to have\nfunctional currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar using\nforward foreign exchange\ncontracts that typically\nsettle in less than 180\ndays, cross-currency basis\nswaps and foreign exchange\noptions. We recorded net\nafter-tax losses on\nderivatives in accumulated\nOCI associated with net\ninvestment hedges which were\noffset by gains on our net\ninvestments in consolidated\nnon-U.S. entities at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nTable 48 presents\nderivatives utilized in our\nALM activities and shows the\nnotional amount, fair value,\nweighted-average receive-\nfixed and pay-fixed rates,\nexpected maturity and\naverage estimated durations\nof our open ALM derivatives\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019. These amounts do not\ninclude derivative hedges on\nour MSRs.

Changes in\ninterest rates and other\nmarket factors impact the\nvolume of mortgage\noriginations. Changes in\ninterest rates also impact\nthe value of interest rate\nlock commitments (IRLCs) and\nthe related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-\nfor-sale (LHFS) between the\ndate of the IRLC and the\ndate the loans are sold to\nthe secondary market. An\nincrease in mortgage\ninterest rates typically\nleads to a decrease in the\nvalue of these instruments.\nConversely, when there is an\nincrease in interest rates,\nthe value of the MSRs will\nincrease driven by lower\nprepayment expectations.\nBecause the interest rate\nrisks of these hedged items\noffset, we combine them into\none overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge\nportfolio consisting of\nderivative contracts and\nsecurities.\n\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nwe recorded gains of $321\nmillion, $291 million and\n$244 million related to the\nchange in fair value of the\nMSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the\nhedge portfolio.

The\nBoard provides oversight of\ncompliance risk through its\nAudit Committee and the ERC,\nand operational risk through\nthe ERC.\n\nA key operational risk\nfacing the Corporation is\ninformation security, which\nincludes cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity risk\nrepresents, among other\nthings, exposure to failures\nor interruptions of service\nor breaches of security,\nincluding as a result of\nmalicious technological\nattacks, that impact the\nconfidentiality,\navailability or integrity of\nour, or third parties'\n(including their downstream\nservice providers, the\nfinancial services industry\nand financial data\naggregators) operations,\nsystems or data, including\nsensitive corporate and\ncustomer information. The\nCorporation manages\ninformation security risk in\naccordance with internal\npolicies which govern our\ncomprehensive information\nsecurity program designed to\nprotect the Corporation by\nenabling preventative,\ndetective and responsive\nmeasures to combat\ninformation and\ncybersecurity risks.

If\nreputational risk events\noccur, we focus on\nremediating the underlying\nissue and taking action to\nminimize damage to the\nCorporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Corporation has\nprocesses and procedures in\nplace to respond to events\nthat give rise to\nreputational risk, including\neducating individuals and\norganizations that influence\npublic opinion, implementing\nexternal communication\nstrategies to mitigate the\nrisk, and informing key\nstakeholders of potential\nreputational risks. The\nCorporation\u2019s organization\nand governance structure\nprovides oversight of\nreputational risks, and\nreputational risk reporting\nis provided regularly and\ndirectly to management and\nthe ERC, which provides\nprimary oversight of\nreputational risk. In\naddition, each FLU has a\ncommittee, which includes\nrepresentatives from\nCompliance, Legal and Risk,\nthat is responsible for the\noversight of reputational\nrisk. Such committees\u2019\noversight includes providing\napproval for business\nactivities that present\nelevated levels of\nreputational risks.\n                                                         \n   Climate Risk Management                               \n                                                         \nClimate-related risks are\ndivided into two major\ncategories: (1) risks\nrelated to the transition to\na low-carbon economy, which\nmay entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market\n\nchanges, and (2) risks\nrelated to the physical\nimpacts of climate change,\ndriven by extreme weather\nevents, such as hurricanes\nand floods, as well as\nchronic longer-term shifts,\nsuch as temperature\nincreases and sea level\nrises. These changes and\nevents can have broad\nimpacts on operations,\nsupply chains, distribution\nnetworks, customers, and\nmarkets and are otherwise\nreferred to, respectively,\nas transition risk and\nphysical risk. The financial\nimpacts of transition risk\ncan lead to and amplify\ncredit risk. Physical risk\ncan also lead to increased\ncredit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral\nvalues.\n\nAs climate risk is\ninterconnected with all key\nrisk types, we have\ndeveloped and continue to\nenhance processes to embed\nclimate risk considerations\ninto our Risk Framework and\nrisk management programs\nestablished for strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and\nreputational risks. A key\nelement of how we manage\nclimate risk is the Risk\nIdentification process\nthrough which climate and\nother risks are identified\nacross all FLUs and control\nfunctions, prioritized in\nour risk inventory and\nevaluated to determine\nestimated severity and\nlikelihood of occurrence.\nOnce identified, climate\nrisks are assessed for\npotential impacts and\nincorporated into the design\nof macroeconomic scenarios\nto generate loss forecasts\nand assess how climate-\nrelated impacts could affect\nus and our clients.\n\nOur governance framework\nestablishes oversight of\nclimate risk practices and\nstrategies by the Board,\nsupported by its Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee,\nthe ERC and the Global\nEnvironmental, Social and\nGovernance Committee, a\nmanagement-level committee\ncomprised of senior leaders\nacross every major FLU and\ncontrol function. The\nClimate Risk Steering\nCouncil oversees our climate\nrisk management practices,\nshapes our approach to\nmanaging climate-related\nrisks in line with our Risk\nFramework and meets monthly.\nIn 2020, the climate risk\nmanagement effort was\nbolstered through the\nappointment of a Global\nClimate Risk Executive who\nreports to the CRO, and\nestablishment of a new\ndivision within our Global\nRisk organization to drive\nexecution of the climate\nrisk management program with\nthe support of FLUs,\nTechnology & Operations and\nRisk partners.

Many\nof our significant\naccounting principles\nrequire complex judgments to\nestimate the values of\nassets and liabilities. We\nhave procedures and\nprocesses in place to\nfacilitate making these\njudgments.\n\nThe more judgmental\nestimates are summarized in\nthe following discussion. We\nhave identified and\ndescribed the development of\nthe variables most important\nin the estimation processes\nthat involve mathematical\nmodels to derive the\nestimates. In many cases,\nthere are numerous\nalternative judgments that\ncould be used in the process\nof determining the inputs to\nthe models. Where\nalternatives exist, we have\nused the factors that we\nbelieve represent the most\nreasonable value in\ndeveloping the inputs.\nActual performance that\ndiffers from our estimates\nof the key variables could\nmaterially impact our\nresults of operations.\nSeparate from the possible\nfuture impact to our results\nof operations from input and\nmodel variables, the value\nof our lending portfolio and\nmarket-sensitive assets and\n                                                         \n  85Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nliabilities may change\nsubsequent to the balance\nsheet date, often\nsignificantly, due to the\nnature and magnitude of\nfuture credit and market\nconditions. Such credit and\nmarket conditions may change\nquickly and in unforeseen\nways and the resulting\nvolatility could have a\nsignificant, negative effect\non future operating results.\nThese fluctuations would not\nbe indicative of\ndeficiencies in our models\nor inputs.\n                                                         \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                            \n                                                         \nOn January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses, which includes the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses and the reserve for\nunfunded lending\ncommitments, to be based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate\nof lifetime ECL inherent in\nthe Corporation's relevant\nfinancial assets.\n\nThe Corporation's estimate\nof lifetime ECL includes the\nuse of quantitative models\nthat incorporate forward-\nlooking macroeconomic\nscenarios that are applied\nover the contractual life of\nthe loan portfolios,\nadjusted for expected\nprepayments and borrower-\ncontrolled extension\noptions. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables\nthat have historically been\nkey drivers of increases and\ndecreases in credit losses.\nThese variables include, but\nare not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real\nestate prices, gross\ndomestic product and\ncorporate bond spreads. As\nany one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages\nmultiple scenarios. The\nscenarios that are chosen\neach quarter and the amount\nof weighting given to each\nscenario depend on a variety\nof factors including recent\neconomic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views\nof internal and third-party\neconomists and industry\ntrends.\n\nThe Corporation also\nincludes qualitative\nreserves to cover losses\nthat are expected but, in\nthe Corporation's\nassessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the\neconomic assumptions\ndescribed above. For\nexample, factors the\nCorporation considers\ninclude changes in lending\npolicies and procedures,\nbusiness conditions, the\nnature and size of the\nportfolio, portfolio\nconcentrations, the volume\nand severity of past due\nloans and nonaccrual loans,\nthe effect of external\nfactors such as competition\nand legal and regulatory\nrequirements, among others.\nFurther, the Corporation\nconsiders the inherent\nuncertainty in quantitative\nmodels that are built on\nhistorical data.\n\nThe allowance for credit\nlosses can also be impacted\nby unanticipated changes in\nasset quality of the\nportfolio, such as increases\nin risk rating downgrades in\nour commercial portfolio,\ndeterioration in borrower\ndelinquencies or credit\nscores in our credit card\nportfolio or increases in\nLTVs in our consumer real\nestate portfolio. In\naddition, while we have\nincorporated our estimated\nimpact of COVID-19 into our\nallowance for credit losses,\nthe ultimate impact of the\npandemic is still unknown,\nincluding how long economic\nactivities will be impacted\nand what effect the\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment fiscal and\nmonetary actions will have\non the economy and our\ncredit losses.\n\nAs described above, the\nprocess to determine the\nallowance for credit losses\nrequires numerous estimates\nand assumptions, some of\nwhich require a high degree\nof judgment and are often\ninterrelated. Changes in the\nestimates and assumptions\ncan result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Our process\nfor determining the\nallowance for credit losses\nis further discussed in Note\n1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans\n\nand Leases and Allowance for\nCredit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                         \n   Fair Value of Financial Instruments                   \n                                                         \nUnder applicable accounting\nstandards, we are required\nto maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and\nminimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in\nmeasuring fair value. We\nclassify fair value\nmeasurements of financial\ninstruments and MSRs based\non the three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy in the\naccounting standards.\n\nThe fair values of assets\nand liabilities may include\nadjustments, such as market\nliquidity and credit\nquality, where appropriate.\nValuations of products using\nmodels or other techniques\nare sensitive to assumptions\nused for the significant\ninputs. Where market data is\navailable, the inputs used\nfor valuation reflect that\ninformation as of our\nvaluation date. Inputs to\nvaluation models are\nconsidered unobservable if\nthey are supported by little\nor no market activity. In\nperiods of extreme\nvolatility, lessened\nliquidity or in illiquid\nmarkets, there may be more\nvariability in market\npricing or a lack of market\ndata to use in the valuation\nprocess. In keeping with the\nprudent application of\nestimates and management\njudgment in determining the\nfair value of assets and\nliabilities, we have in\nplace various processes and\ncontrols that include: a\nmodel validation policy that\nrequires review and approval\nof quantitative models used\nfor deal pricing, financial\nstatement fair value\ndetermination and risk\nquantification; a trading\nproduct valuation policy\nthat requires verification\nof all traded product\nvaluations; and a periodic\nreview and substantiation of\ndaily profit and loss\nreporting for all traded\nproducts. Primarily through\nvalidation controls, we\nutilize both broker and\npricing service inputs which\ncan and do include both\nmarket-observable and\ninternally-modeled values\nand/or valuation inputs. Our\nreliance on this information\nis affected by our\nunderstanding of how the\nbroker and/or pricing\nservice develops its data\nwith a higher degree of\nreliance applied to those\nthat are more directly\nobservable and lesser\nreliance applied to those\ndeveloped through their own\ninternal modeling. For\nexample, broker quotes in\nless active markets may only\nbe indicative and therefore\nless reliable. These\nprocesses and controls are\nperformed independently of\nthe business.

The\nfair value of these Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities and MSRs is\ndetermined using pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies or similar\ntechniques for which the\ndetermination of fair value\nrequires significant\nmanagement judgment or\nestimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial\ninstruments may be hedged\nwith derivatives classified\nas Level 1 or 2; therefore,\ngains or losses associated\nwith Level 3 financial\ninstruments may be offset by\ngains or losses associated\nwith financial instruments\nclassified in other levels\nof the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Level 3 gains and losses\nrecorded in earnings did not\nhave a significant impact on\nour liquidity or capital. We\nconduct a review of our fair\nvalue hierarchy\nclassifications on a\nquarterly basis. Transfers\ninto or out of Level 3 are\nmade if the significant\ninputs used in the financial\nmodels measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and\n                                                         \n  Bank of America86                                      \n                                                         \nliabilities became\nunobservable or observable,\nrespectively, in the current\nmarketplace.

In\nperforming that test, we\ncompared the fair value of\neach reporting unit to its\nestimated carrying value as\nmeasured by allocated\nequity. We estimated the\nfair value of each reporting\nunit based on the income\napproach (which utilizes the\npresent value of cash flows\nto estimate fair value) and\nthe market multiplier\napproach (which utilizes\nobservable market prices and\nmetrics of peer companies to\nestimate fair value).\n\nOur discounted cash flows\nwere generally based on the\nCorporation\u2019s three-year\ninternal forecasts with a\nlong-term growth rate of\n3.68 percent. Our estimated\ncash flows considered the\ncurrent challenging global\nindustry and market\nconditions related to the\npandemic, including the low\ninterest rate environment.\nThe cash flows were\ndiscounted using rates that\nranged from 9 percent to 12\npercent, which were derived\nfrom a capital asset pricing\nmodel that incorporates the\nrisk and uncertainty in the\ncash flow forecasts, the\nfinancial markets and\nindustries similar to each\nof the reporting units.\n\nUnder the market multiplier\napproach, we estimated the\nfair value of the individual\nreporting units utilizing\nvarious market multiples,\nprimarily various pricing\nmultiples, from comparable\npublicly-traded companies in\nindustries similar to the\nreporting unit and then\nfactored in a control\npremium based upon observed\ncomparable premiums paid for\nchange-in-control\ntransactions for financial\ninstitutions.\n\nBased on the results of the\ntest, we determined that\neach reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value\nexceeded its respective\ncarrying value and that the\ngoodwill assigned to each\nreporting unit was not\nimpaired. The fair values of\nthe reporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from 109\npercent to 213 percent. It\ncurrently remains difficult\nto estimate the future\neconomic impacts related to\nthe pandemic. If economic\nand market conditions (both\nin the U.S. and\ninternationally)\ndeteriorate, our reporting\nunits could be negatively\nimpacted, which could change\nour key assumptions and\nrelated estimates and may\nresult in a future\nimpairment charge.\n                                                         \n  Certain Contingent Liabilities                         \n

Our\nresponsibility is to express\nopinions on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on\nthe Corporation's internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting based on our\naudits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be\nindependent with respect to\nthe Corporation in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB.\nThose standards require that\nwe plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements are free of\nmaterial misstatement,\nwhether due to error or\nfraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting was\nmaintained in all material\nrespects. Our audits of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included\nexamining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\n\naccounting principles used\nand significant estimates\nmade by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding\nof internal control over\nfinancial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists,\nand testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits\nalso included performing\nsuch other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations\nof Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is\na process designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the\npreparation of financial\nstatements for external\npurposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting\nincludes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the assets\nof the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance\nwith generally accepted\naccounting principles, and\nthat receipts and\nexpenditures of the company\nare being made only in\naccordance with\nauthorizations of management\nand directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or\ntimely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are\nsubject to the risk that\ncontrols may become\ninadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or\nthat the degree of\ncompliance with the policies\nor procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                                                         \n  Critical Audit Matters                                 \n                                                         \nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are\nmatters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical\naudit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions\non the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which they\nrelate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease\nLosses - Commercial and\nConsumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and\n5 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in\nthe Corporation\u2019s loan and\nlease portfolio, excluding\nloans and unfunded lending\ncommitments accounted for\nunder the fair value option.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses was $18.8 billion on\ntotal loans and leases of\n$921.2 billion, which\nexcludes loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option.\nFor commercial and consumer\ncard loans, the expected\ncredit loss is estimated\nusing quantitative methods\n                                                         \n  95Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nthat consider a variety of\nfactors such as historical\nloss experience, the current\ncredit quality of the\nportfolio as well as an\neconomic outlook over the\nlife of the loan. In its\nloss forecasting framework,\nthe Corporation incorporates\nforward looking information\nthrough the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios\napplied over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios\ninclude variables that have\nhistorically been key\ndrivers of increases and\ndecreases in credit losses.\nThese variables include, but\nare not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real\nestate prices, gross\ndomestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. The\nscenarios that are chosen\nand the amount of weighting\ngiven to each scenario\ndepend on a variety of\nfactors including recent\neconomic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views\nof internal as well as\nthird-party economists and\nindustry trends. Also\nincluded in the allowance\nfor loan losses are\nqualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are\nexpected but, in the\nCorporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately\nreflected in the\nquantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions.\nFactors that the Corporation\nconsiders include changes in\nlending policies and\nprocedures, business\nconditions, the nature and\nsize of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations,\nthe volume and severity of\npast due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect\nof external factors such as\ncompetition, and legal and\nregulatory requirements,\namong others. Further, the\nCorporation considers the\ninherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are\nbuilt on historical data.\n\nThe principal considerations\nfor our determination that\nperforming procedures\nrelating to the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses\nfor the commercial and\nconsumer card portfolios is\na critical audit matter are\n(i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management\nin developing lifetime\neconomic forecast scenarios,\nrelated weightings to each\nscenario and certain\nqualitative reserves, which\nin turn led to a high degree\nof auditor judgment,\nsubjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence\nobtained, and (ii) the audit\neffort involved\nprofessionals with\nspecialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in\nevaluating certain audit\nevidence.\n\nAddressing the matter\ninvolved performing\nprocedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection\nwith forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These\nprocedures included testing\nthe effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses, including controls\nover the evaluation and\napproval of models, forecast\nscenarios and related\nweightings, and qualitative\nreserves. These procedures\nalso included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process\nfor estimating the allowance\nfor loan losses, including\n(i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the loss\nforecast models and\nmethodology, (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of\ncertain macroeconomic\nvariables, (iii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s development,\nselection and weighting of\neconomic forecast scenarios\nused in the loss forecast\nmodels, (iv) testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of\ndata used in the estimate,\nand (v) evaluating certain\nqualitative reserves made to\nthe model output results to\ndetermine the overall\nallowance for loan losses.\nThe procedures also included\nthe involvement of\nprofessionals with\nspecialized\n\nskill and knowledge to\nassist in evaluating the\nappropriateness of certain\nloss forecast models, the\nreasonableness of economic\nforecast scenarios and\nrelated weightings and the\nreasonableness of certain\nqualitative reserves.\n\nValuation of Certain Level 3\nFinancial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and\n20 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCorporation carries certain\nfinancial instruments at\nfair value, which includes\n$10.0 billion of assets and\n$7.4 billion of liabilities\nclassified as Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements on a\nrecurring basis and $1.7\nbillion of assets classified\nas Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements on a\nnonrecurring basis, for\nwhich the determination of\nfair value requires\nsignificant management\njudgment or estimation. The\nCorporation determines the\nfair value of Level 3\nfinancial instruments using\npricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques that\nrequire inputs that are both\nunobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall\nfair value measurement.\nUnobservable inputs, such as\nvolatility or price, may be\ndetermined using\nquantitative-based\nextrapolations or other\ninternal methodologies which\nincorporate management\nestimates and available\nmarket information.\n\nThe principal considerations\nfor our determination that\nperforming procedures\nrelating to the valuation of\ncertain Level 3 financial\ninstruments is a critical\naudit matter are the\nsignificant judgment and\nestimation used by\nmanagement to determine the\nfair value of these\nfinancial instruments, which\nin turn led to a high degree\nof auditor judgment and\neffort in performing\nprocedures, including the\ninvolvement of professionals\nwith specialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in\nevaluating certain audit\nevidence.\n\nAddressing the matter\ninvolved performing\nprocedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection\nwith forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These\nprocedures included testing\nthe effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the\nvaluation of financial\ninstruments, including\ncontrols related to\nvaluation models,\nsignificant unobservable\ninputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included,\namong others, the\ninvolvement of professionals\nwith specialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in\ndeveloping an independent\nestimate of fair value for a\nsample of these certain\nfinancial instruments and\ncomparison of management\u2019s\nestimate to the\nindependently developed\nestimate of fair value.\nDeveloping the independent\nestimate involved testing\nthe completeness and\naccuracy of data provided by\nmanagement and evaluating\nthe reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s assumptions\nused to develop the\nsignificant unobservable\ninputs.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 24, 2021\n\nWe have served as the\nCorporation\u2019s auditor since\n1958.\n                                                         \n

holding company and a\nfinancial holding company,\nprovides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and\nproducts throughout the U.S.\nand in certain international\nmarkets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein\nmay refer to Bank of America\nCorporation, individually,\nBank of America Corporation\nand its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s subsidiaries\nor affiliates. Principles of\nConsolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements include the\naccounts of the Corporation\nand its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those\nvariable interest entities\n(VIEs) where the Corporation\nis the primary beneficiary.\nIntercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been\neliminated. Results of\noperations of acquired\ncompanies are included from\nthe dates of acquisition,\nand for VIEs, from the dates\nthat the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary.\nAssets held in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. The\nCorporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for\nwhich it owns a voting\ninterest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over\noperating and financing\ndecisions using the equity\nmethod of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in\nother assets. Equity method\ninvestments are subject to\nimpairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate\nshare of income or loss is\nincluded in other income.\nThe preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in conformity\nwith accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the\nUnited States of America\nrequires management to make\nestimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts\nand disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially\ndiffer from those estimates\nand assumptions. Certain\nprior-period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform\nto current period\npresentation. New Accounting\nStandards Accounting for\nFinancial Instruments --\nCredit Losses On January 1,\n2020, the Corporation\nadopted the new accounting\nstandard that requires the\nmeasurement of the allowance\nfor credit losses to be\nbased on management\u2019s best\nestimate of lifetime\nexpected credit losses (ECL)\ninherent in the\nCorporation\u2019s relevant\nfinancial assets. Upon\nadoption of the standard on\nJanuary 1, 2020, the\nCorporation recorded a $\n3.3billion, or 32percent,\nincrease to the allowance\nfor credit losses. After\nadjusting for deferred taxes\nand other adoption effects,\na $ 2.4billion decrease was\nrecorded in retained\nearnings through a\ncumulative-effect\nadjustment. Prior to January\n1, 2020, the allowance for\ncredit losses was determined\nbased on management\u2019s\nestimate of probable\nincurred losses. Reference\nRate Reform The Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issued a new\naccounting standard in March\n2020, which was subsequently\namended in January 2021,\nrelated to contracts or\nhedging relationships that\nreference London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) or\nother reference rates that\nare expected to be\ndiscontinued due to\nreference rate reform. The\nnew standard provides for\noptional expedients and\nother guidance regarding the\naccounting related to\nmodifications of contracts,\nhedging\n\nrelationships and other\ntransactions affected by\nreference rate reform. The\nCorporation has elected to\nretrospectively adopt the\nnew standard as of January\n1, 2020. The adoption did\nnot have a material\naccounting impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position or\nresults of operations;\nhowever, it did ease the\nadministrative burden in\naccounting for certain\neffects of reference rate\nreform. Significant\nAccounting Principles Cash\nand Cash Equivalents Cash\nand cash equivalents include\ncash on hand, cash items in\nthe process of collection,\ncash segregated under\nfederal and other brokerage\nregulations, and amounts due\nfrom correspondent banks,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank and\ncertain non-U.S. central\nbanks. Certain cash balances\nare restricted as to\nwithdrawal or usage by\nlegally binding contractual\nagreements or regulatory\nrequirements. Securities\nFinancing Agreements\nSecurities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements\nto resell and securities\nloaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase\n(securities financing\nagreements) are treated as\ncollateralized financing\ntransactions except in\ninstances where the\ntransaction is required to\nbe accounted for as\nindividual sale and purchase\ntransactions. Generally,\nthese agreements are\nrecorded at acquisition or\nsale price plus accrued\ninterest, except for\nsecurities financing\nagreements that the\nCorporation accounts for\nunder the fair value option.\nChanges in the fair value of\nsecurities financing\nagreements that are\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option are recorded in\nmarket making and similar\nactivities in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. The Corporation\u2019s\npolicy is to monitor the\nmarket value of the\nprincipal amount loaned\nunder resale agreements and\nobtain collateral from or\nreturn collateral pledged to\ncounterparties when\nappropriate. Securities\nfinancing agreements do not\ncreate material credit risk\ndue to these collateral\nprovisions; therefore, an\nallowance for loan losses is\nnot necessary. In\ntransactions where the\nCorporation acts as the\nlender in a securities\nlending agreement and\nreceives securities that can\nbe pledged or sold as\ncollateral, it recognizes an\nasset on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet at fair value,\nrepresenting the securities\nreceived, and a liability,\nrepresenting the obligation\nto return those securities.\nCollateral The Corporation\naccepts securities and loans\nas collateral that it is\npermitted by contract or\npractice to sell or\nrepledge. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the fair\nvalue of this collateral was\n$ 812.4billion and $\n693.0billion, of which $\n758.5billion and $\n593.8billion were sold or\nrepledged. The primary\nsource of this collateral is\nsecurities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements\nto resell. The Corporation\nalso pledges company-owned\nsecurities and loans as\ncollateral in transactions\nthat include repurchase\nagreements, securities\nloaned, public and trust\ndeposits, U.S. Treasury tax\nand loan notes, and short-\nterm borrowings. This\ncollateral, which in some\ncases can be sold or\nrepledged by the\ncounterparties to the\ntransactions, is\nparenthetically disclosed on\nthe Consolidated Balance\nSheet. In certain cases, the\nCorporation has transferred\nassets to consolidated VIEs\nwhere those restricted\nassets serve as collateral\nfor the interests issued by\nthe VIEs. These assets are\nincluded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in Assets of\nConsolidated VIEs.\n                                                         \n  101Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in\nconnection with its derivative contracts. Required\ncollateral levels vary depending on the credit risk\nrating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the\nCorporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S.\nTreasury securities and other marketable securities.\nBased on provisions contained in master netting\nagreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received\nagainst derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges\ncollateral on its own derivative positions which can be\napplied against derivative liabilities. Trading\nInstruments Financial instruments utilized in trading\nactivities are carried at fair value. Fair value is\ngenerally based on quoted market prices for the same or\nsimilar assets and liabilities. If these market prices\nare not available, fair values are estimated based on\ndealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, or similar techniques where the\ndetermination of fair value may require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. Realized gains and\nlosses are recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are recognized in market\nmaking and similar activities. Derivatives and Hedging\nActivities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of\ncustomers, for trading or to support risk management\nactivities. Derivatives used in risk management\nactivities include derivatives that are both designated\nin qualifying accounting hedge relationships and\nderivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships\nthat are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships (referred to as other risk management\nactivities). The Corporation manages interest rate and\nforeign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly\nthrough the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by\nthe Corporation include swaps, futures and forward\nsettlement contracts, and option contracts. All\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet at fair value, taking into consideration the\neffects of legally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat allow the Corporation to settle positive and\nnegative positions and offset cash collateral held with\nthe same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded\ncontracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in\nactive or inactive markets or is derived from observable\nmarket-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied\nto over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes,\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques for which the determination of fair\nvalue may require significant management judgment or\nestimation. Valuations of derivative assets and\nliabilities reflect the value of the instrument including\ncounterparty credit risk. These values also take into\naccount the Corporation\u2019s own credit standing. Trading\nDerivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in\nderivative assets or derivative liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value\nincluded in market making and similar activities.\nDerivatives used for other risk management activities are\nincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities.\nDerivatives used in other risk management activities have\nnot been designated in qualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships because they did not qualify or the risk\nthat is being mitigated pertains to an item that is\nreported at fair value through earnings so that the\neffect of measuring the derivative instrument and the\nasset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains\nwill offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to\nthe extent effective. The changes in the fair value of\nderivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks\nassociated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien\nmortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated\nby the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate\ninterest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included\nin market making and similar activities. Credit\nderivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate\nthe risk associated with various credit exposures. The\nchanges in the fair value of these derivatives are\nincluded in market making and similar activities and\nother income. Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting\nPurposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the\nCorporation formally documents at inception all\nrelationships between hedging instruments and hedged\nitems, as well as the risk management objectives and\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges.\nAdditionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression\nanalysis at the inception of a hedge and for each\nreporting period thereafter to assess whether the\nderivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is\nexpected to be and has been highly effective in\noffsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a\nhedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation\ndiscontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that\na derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be\nhighly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in\nfair value of the derivative in earnings after\ntermination of the hedge relationship. Fair value hedges\nare used to protect against changes in the fair value of\nthe Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that are\nattributable to interest rate or foreign exchange\nvolatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings,\ntogether and in the same income statement line item with\nchanges in the fair value of the related hedged item. If\na derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is\nterminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous\nadjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or\nliability are subsequently accounted for in the same\nmanner as other components of the carrying value of that\nasset or liability. For interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are\namortized to earnings over the remaining life of the\nrespective asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are used\nprimarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of\nassets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused\nby interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the\nprice risk associated with deferred compensation. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges\nare recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the\nincome statement in which the hedged item is recorded in\nthe same period the hedged item affects earnings.\nComponents of a derivative that are excluded in assessing\nhedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income\nstatement line item as the hedged item. Net investment\nhedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate\nsensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign\noperation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that\nare designated as net investment hedges of foreign\noperations are recorded as a component of accumulated\nOCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are\nexcluded in\n                                                         \n  Bank of America102                                     \n                                                         \nassessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market\nmaking and similar activities. Securities Debt securities\nare reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their\ntrade date. Their classification is dependent on the\npurpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt\nsecurities purchased for use in the Corporation\u2019s trading\nactivities are reported in trading account assets at fair\nvalue with unrealized gains and losses included in market\nmaking and similar activities. Substantially all other\ndebt securities purchased are used in the Corporation\u2019s\nasset and liability management (ALM) activities and are\nreported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt\nsecurities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity\n(HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair\nvalue are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with\nunrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in\naccumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized\ngains and losses reported in market making and similar\nactivities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that\nmanagement has the intent and ability to hold to maturity\nand are reported at amortized cost. The Corporation\nevaluates each AFS security where the value has declined\nbelow amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell\nor believes it is more likely than not that it will be\nrequired to sell the debt security, it is written down to\nfair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the\nCorporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates\nthe debt securities for ECL except for debt securities\nthat are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government\nagencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality\nwhere the Corporation applies a zero credit loss\nassumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the\nCorporation considers qualitative parameters such as\ninternal and external credit ratings and the value of\nunderlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any\nof the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow\nanalysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a\nportion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected\ncredit loss. The Corporation will then recognize either\ncredit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense\nin other income for the amount necessary to adjust the\ndebt securities valuation allowance to its current\nestimate of excepted credit losses. Cash flows expected\nto be collected are estimated using all relevant\ninformation available such as remaining payment terms,\nprepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer,\nexpected defaults and the value of the underlying\ncollateral. If any of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to market factors, that amount is recognized in\naccumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss\nmay exceed the total decline in fair value, in which\ncase, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference\nbetween the amortized cost and the fair value of the\nasset. The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt\nsecurities for any credit losses, of which substantially\nall qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the\nremaining securities, the Corporation performs a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit\nlosses which are then recognized as part of the allowance\nfor credit losses. Interest on debt securities, including\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is\nincluded in interest income. Premiums and discounts are\namortized or accreted to interest income at a constant\neffective yield over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of\ndebt securities are determined using the specific\nidentification method. Equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values that are not held for trading\npurposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains\nand losses included in other income. Equity securities\nthat do not have readily determinable fair values are\nrecorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus\nqualifying observable price changes. These securities are\nreported in other assets. Loans and Leases Loans, with\nthe exception of loans accounted for under the fair value\noption, are measured at historical cost and reported at\ntheir outstanding principal balances net of any unearned\nincome, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs\non originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any\nunamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees\nand certain direct origination costs are deferred and\nrecognized as adjustments to interest income over the\nlives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts\nand premiums are amortized to interest income using a\nlevel yield methodology. The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain consumer and commercial loans under\nthe fair value option with interest reported in interest\nincome and changes in fair value reported in market\nmaking and similar activities or other income. Under\napplicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes,\nthe loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio\nsegment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of\nfinancing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as\nthe level at which an entity develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the allowance for\ncredit losses, and a class of financing receivables is\ndefined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio\nsegments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk\ncharacteristics and methods for assessing risk. The\nCorporation\u2019s threeportfolio segments are Consumer Real\nEstate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial.\nThe classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio\nsegment are residential mortgage and home equity . The\nclasses within the Credit Card and Other Consumer\nportfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect\nconsumer and other consumer. The classes within the\nCommercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial,\nnon-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial\nlease financing and U.S. small business commercial.\nLeases The Corporation provides equipment financing to\nits customers through a variety of lessor arrangements.\nDirect financing leases and sales-type leases are carried\nat the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the\nestimated residual value of the leased property less\nunearned income, which is accreted to interest income\nover the lease terms using methods that approximate the\ninterest method. Operating lease income is recognized on\na straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease\narrangements generally do not contain non-lease\ncomponents. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for\ncredit losses includes both the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments and represents management\u2019s estimate of the\nECL in the Corporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,\nexcluding loans and unfunded lending commitments\naccounted for under the fair value option. The ECL on\nfunded consumer and commercial loans and leases is\nreferred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses\nand is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and\nleases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for\nunfunded lending commitments, including home\n                                                         \n  103Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nequity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of\ncredit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is\nreported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit\nlosses related to the loan and lease portfolio and\nunfunded lending commitments is reported in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. For loans and leases,\nthe ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods\nthat consider a variety of factors such as historical\nloss experience, the current credit quality of the\nportfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of\nthe loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products\nis based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted\nfor any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity\nincludes any extension options that are at the sole\ndiscretion of the borrower. For open-ended products\n(e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on\nthe maximum repayment term associated with future draws\nfrom credit lines unless those lines of credit are\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which\ncase the Corporation does not record any allowance. In\nits loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use\nof macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include\nvariables that have historically been key drivers of\nincreases and decreases in credit losses. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real\nestate prices, gross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple\nscenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and\nthe weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety\nof factors including recent economic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views of internal and third-party\neconomists and industry trends. The estimate of credit\nlosses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has\nbeen charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are\nnot limited by the current amortized cost balance.\nInstead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the\nunpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-\noff. The allowance for loan and lease losses for troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the\npresent value of projected future lifetime principal and\ninterest cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is\nprobable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the\nloan\u2019s collateral value or its observable market price,\nif available. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated\nconsumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the\npresent value of projected cash flows discounted using\nthe average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate,\nexcluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to\nrestructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same\neconomic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of\ncomputing this specific loss component of the allowance,\nlarger impaired loans are evaluated individually and\nsmaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool. Also\nincluded in the allowance for loan and lease losses are\nqualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions described above. For example,\nfactors that the Corporation considers include changes in\nlending policies and procedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio, portfolio\nconcentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans\nand nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such\nas competition, and legal and regulatory requirements,\namong others. Further, the Corporation considers the\ninherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are\nbuilt on historical data. With the exception of the\nCorporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does\nnot include reserves for interest receivable in the\nmeasurement of the allowance for credit losses as the\nCorporation generally classifies consumer loans as\nnonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest\nincome for these loans at that time. For credit card\nloans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as\npart of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon\ncharge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation\nreverses the interest and fee income against the income\nstatement line item where it was originally recorded. The\nCorporation has identified the following threeportfolio\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses\nusing the following methods. Consumer Real Estate To\nestimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential\nreal estate, the Corporation estimates the number of\nloans that will default over the life of the existing\nportfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments,\nusing quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes\nthat are most significant in estimating the Corporation\u2019s\nECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case\nof a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and\ngeography, all of which are further broken down by\npresent collection status (whether the loan is current,\ndelinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates\nare based on the Corporation\u2019s historical experience with\nthe loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic\noutlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and\nconsumer real estate prices are key factors that impact\nthe frequency and severity of loss estimates. The\nCorporation does not reserve for credit losses on the\nunpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans,\nas these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records\na reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL\nassociated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation\u2019s\nHELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if\ncertain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these\nunfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same\nmodels and methodologies noted above and incorporate\nutilization assumptions at time of default. For loans\nthat are more than 180 days past due and collateral-\ndependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on\nthe estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as\nof the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value\nof the collateral securing these loans is generally\ndetermined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that\nestimates the value of a property by reference to market\ndata including sales of comparable properties and price\ntrends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in\nwhich the property being valued is located. In the event\nthat an AVM value is not available, the Corporation\nutilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide\nless reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals\nor broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of\nthe collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in\nthese valuations, the Corporation believes that they are\nrepresentative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For\nloans that are more than 180 days past due and\ncollateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the\nCorporation\u2019s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding\nbalance of loans that is in excess of the estimated\nproperty value after\n                                                         \n  Bank of America104                                     \n                                                         \nadjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the\nestimated property value decreases in periods subsequent\nto the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an\nadditional charge-off; however, if the value increases in\nperiods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation\nwill adjust the allowance to account for the increase but\nnot to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount.\nCredit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are\nrevolving lines of credit without a defined maturity\ndate. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is\ndetermined by estimating the amount and timing of\nexpected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full\npayments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that\nit will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL\non the future payments incorporates the spending behavior\nof a borrower through time using key borrower-specific\nfactors and the economic outlook described above. The\nCorporation applies all expected payments in accordance\nwith the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and\nDisclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest\ninterest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future\npayments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance\nuntil it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off\namount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score,\ndelinquency status and historical payment behavior are\nall key inputs into the credit card receivable loss\nforecasting model. Future draws on the credit card lines\nare excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally\ncancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending\nportfolio is also determined using quantitative methods\nsupplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative\nmodel estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower\nand loan characteristics such as delinquency status,\nborrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral\ntype and collateral value. Commercial The ECL on\ncommercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate\ncredit losses over the loan\u2019s contractual life at an\nindividual loan level. The models use the contractual\nterms to forecast future principal cash flows while also\nconsidering expected prepayments. For open-ended\ncommitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in\nfunded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s\ndraw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the\ncommitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real\nestate and for which the underlying asset is the primary\nsource of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider\nkey loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net\noperating income and debt service coverage, and captures\nvariations in behavior according to property type and\nregion. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross\ndomestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are\nutilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and\nvacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all\nother commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting\nmodel determines the probabilities of transition to\ndifferent credit risk ratings or default at each point\nover the life of the asset based on the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the\nexposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss\nis determined based on the type of collateral securing\nthe exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower\u2019s\nindustry sector, any guarantors and the geographic\nmarket. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to\nthe economic outlook, and the model considers key\neconomic variables such as unemployment rate, gross\ndomestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and\nother asset prices and equity market returns. In addition\nto the allowance for loan and lease losses, the\nCorporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded\nlending commitments such as letters of credit, financial\nguarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan\ncommitments, excluding commitments accounted for under\nthe fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the\nunfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies\nas the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments. Nonperforming Loans and\nLeases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans\nand leases generally include loans and leases that have\nbeen placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as\nnonperforming. In accordance with the Corporation\u2019s\npolicies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including\nresidential mortgages and home equity loans, are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming at 90days past due unless repayment of the\nloan is insured by the FHA or through individually\ninsured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae\n(FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured\nportfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-\ninsured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status\nand, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming.\nJunior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and classified as nonperforming when the\nunderlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past\ndue even if the junior-lien loan is current. The\noutstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is\nin excess of the estimated property value less costs to\nsell is charged off no later than the end of the month in\nwhich the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan\nis fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within\n60days of receipt of notification of filing, with the\nremaining balance classified as nonperforming. Consumer\nloans secured by personal property, credit card loans and\nother unsecured consumer loans are not placed on\nnonaccrual status prior to charge-off and, therefore, are\nnot reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain\nsecured consumer loans, including those that have been\nmodified in a TDR. Personal property-secured loans\n(including auto loans) are charged off to collateral\nvalue no later than the end of the month in which the\naccount becomes 120days past due, or upon repossession of\nan auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of\nreceipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other\nunsecured customer loans are charged off no later than\nthe end of the month in which the account becomes 180days\npast due, within 60days after receipt of notification of\ndeath or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud.\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card\nloans, that are past due 90days or more as to principal\nor interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to\ntimely collection, including loans that are individually\nidentified as being impaired, are generally placed on\nnonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless\nwell-secured and in the process of collection. Business\ncard loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer\ncredit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are\ngenerally charged off when all or a portion of the\nprincipal amount is determined to be uncollectible. The\nentire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or\nlease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment\nis not received by the specified due date on the\ncustomer\u2019s billing statement. Interest and fees continue\nto accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the\nloan is placed on nonaccrual\n                                                         \n  105Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nstatus, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is\nreversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and\nleases for which the ultimate collectability of principal\nis uncertain are applied as principal reductions;\notherwise, such collections are credited to income when\nreceived. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual\nstatus when all principal and interest is current and\nfull repayment of the remaining contractual principal and\ninterest is expected. Troubled Debt Restructurings\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose\ncontractual terms have been restructured in a manner that\ngrants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could\ninclude a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that\nis below market on the loan, payment extensions,\nforgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions\ndesigned to maximize collections. Loans that are carried\nat fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs. Loans\nand leases whose contractual terms have been modified in\na TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may\nremain on accrual status if there is demonstrated\nperformance prior to the restructuring and payment in\nfull under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise,\nthe loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as\nnonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real\nestate loans, until there is sustained repayment\nperformance for a reasonable period, generally six\nmonths. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance\nwith their modified contractual terms, they are placed on\nnonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.\nSecured consumer loans that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the\nborrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge.\nSuch loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written\ndown to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell\nno later than at the time of discharge. If these loans\nare contractually current, interest collections are\ngenerally recorded in interest income on a cash basis.\nConsumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding\noffer to restructure has been extended are also\nclassified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured\nconsumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR\ngenerally remain on accrual status until the loan is\neither paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later\nthan the end of the month in which the loan becomes\n180days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a\nfixed payment plan, 120days past due. A loan that had\npreviously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently\nrefinanced under current underwriting standards at a\nmarket rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for\nas a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\nCOVID-19 Programs The Corporation has implemented various\nconsumer and commercial loan modification programs to\nprovide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic). In accordance with\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n(CARES Act), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR\nclassification to eligible COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to\nloans that were current as of December 31, 2019.\nAccordingly, these restructurings are not classified as\nTDRs. The availability of this election expires upon the\nearlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national\nemergency related to COVID-19 terminates. In addition,\nfor loans modified in response to the pandemic that do\nnot meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status\nat December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the\nguidance included in an interagency statement issued by\nthe bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that\nloan modifications performed in light of the pandemic,\nincluding loan payment deferrals that are up to six\nmonths in duration, that were granted to borrowers who\nwere current as of the implementation date of a loan\nmodification program or modifications granted under\ngovernment mandated modification programs, are not TDRs.\nFor loan modifications that include a payment deferral\nand are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and nonaccrual\nstatus have not been impacted during the deferral period.\nThe Corporation has continued to accrue interest during\nthe deferral period using a constant effective yield\nmethod. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan\nmodifications, the contractual interest that accrued\nduring the deferral period is payable at the maturity of\nthe loan. The Corporation includes these amounts with the\nunpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for\ncredit losses. Amounts that are subsequently deemed\nuncollectible are written off against the allowance for\ncredit losses. Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the\nCorporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future,\nincluding residential mortgages, loan syndications, and\nto a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer\nfinance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are\ncarried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The\nCorporation accounts for certain LHFS, including\nresidential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option.\nLoan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of\ncost or fair value are capitalized as part of the\ncarrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan,\nare recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest\nincome. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are\nreported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy\nherein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans\nand leases. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment\nare carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and\namortization. Depreciation and amortization are\nrecognized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives\nrange up to 40years for buildings, up to 12years for\nfurniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or\nestimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Other\nAssets For the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and are not included in debt\nsecurities or loans and leases on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for\nECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject\nto collateral maintenance provisions, including federal\nfunds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, where the collateral consists of\ndaily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the\nmargining is expected to be maintained into the\nforeseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be\nzero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs\nqualitative analyses, including consideration of\nhistorical losses and current economic conditions, to\nestimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation\naccount that is recorded as a contra-asset against the\namortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America106                                     \n                                                         \nLessee Arrangements Substantially all of the\nCorporation\u2019s lessee arrangements are operating leases.\nUnder these arrangements, the Corporation records right-\nof-use assets and lease liabilities at lease\ncommencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related\nlease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities. All leases are recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial\nterm less than 12 months for which the Corporation made\nthe short-term lease election. Lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term\nand is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation made an\naccounting policy election not to separate lease and non-\nlease components of a contract that is or contains a\nlease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such,\nlease payments represent payments on both lease and non-\nlease components. At lease commencement, lease\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of\nthe remaining lease payments and discounted using the\nCorporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use\nassets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for\nany lease payments made prior to lease commencement and\nfor any lease incentives. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the\nfair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not\namortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an\nannual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a\npotential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A\nreporting unit is a business segment or one level below a\nbusiness segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value\nof each reporting unit against its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation\nutilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying\nvalue of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the\nreporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus\ncapital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting unit. In\nperforming its goodwill impairment testing, the\nCorporation first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\nvalue. Qualitative factors include, among other things,\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, financial performance of the respective\nreporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-\nunit specific considerations. If the Corporation\nconcludes it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a\nquantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has\nan unconditional option to bypass the qualitative\nassessment for any reporting unit in any period and\nproceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test. The Corporation may resume performing\nthe qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When\nperforming the quantitative assessment, if the fair value\nof the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,\ngoodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered\nimpaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would\nbe recognized for the amount by which the reporting\nunit\u2019s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An\nimpairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of\ngoodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss\nestablishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent\nreversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted\nunder applicable accounting guidance. For intangible\nassets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is\nrecognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset\nis not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying\nvalue of the intangible asset is considered not\nrecoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted\ncash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.\nIntangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives\nare not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is\nrecognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset\nwith an indefinite life exceeds its fair value. Variable\nInterest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity\ninvestors or whose equity investors do not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in the entity through\ntheir equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a\nVIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of\nthe VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and an obligation to absorb losses or the\nright to receive benefits that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the\nCorporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and\nevaluates the impact of changes in governing documents\nand its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation\nstatus of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved\nmay change as a result of such reassessments. The\nCorporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization\nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole\nloans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle.\nWhen the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held\nin a securitization trust, including non-agency\nresidential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards,\nand other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct\nthe most significant activities of the trust. The\nCorporation generally does not have the power to direct\nthe most significant activities of a residential mortgage\nagency trust except in certain circumstances in which the\nCorporation holds substantially all of the issued\nsecurities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the\ntrust. The power to direct the most significant\nactivities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust\nis typically held by the special servicer or by the party\nholding specific subordinate securities which embody\ncertain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates\na whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to\ndirect the most significant activities and also holds\nsecurities issued by the trust or has other contractual\narrangements, other than standard representations and\nwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the\ntrust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account\nsecurities and AFS securities into municipal bond or\nresecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a\nmunicipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has\ncontrol over the ongoing activities of the trust such as\nthe remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities or, if there\nare no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the\ndesign of the trust, including the identification of\nsecurities to be transferred in and the structure of\nsecurities to be issued, and also retains securities or\nhas liquidity or other commitments that could potentially\nbe significant to the trust. The Corporation does not\nconsolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if\none or a limited number of third-party investors share\nresponsibility for the design of the trust or have\ncontrol over the significant activities of the trust\nthrough liquidation or other substantive rights. Other\nVIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt\nobligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf\nof customers and other investment vehicles. The\nCorporation does not routinely serve as collateral\nmanager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have\nthe power to direct the\n                                                         \n  107Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of a CDO. However, following an event of\ndefault, if the Corporation is a majority holder of\nsenior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power\nto manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the\nCDO. The Corporation consolidates a customer or other\ninvestment vehicle if it has control over the initial\ndesign of the vehicle or manages the assets in the\nvehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or\nlosses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative\ncontracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not\nconsolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor\ncontrolled the initial design of the vehicle or manages\nthe assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not\nhave a variable interest that could potentially be\nsignificant to the vehicle. Retained interests in\nsecuritized assets are initially recorded at fair value.\nIn addition, the Corporation may invest in debt\nsecurities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of\nthese debt securities, which are classified as trading\naccount assets, debt securities carried at fair value or\nHTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market\nprices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted\nmarket prices for retained residual interests are not\navailable; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair\nvalues based on the present value of the associated\nexpected future cash flows. Fair Value The Corporation\nmeasures the fair values of its assets and liabilities,\nwhere applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance\nthat requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.\nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under\napplicable accounting standards, fair value measurements\nare categorized into one of three levels based on the\ninputs to the valuation technique with the highest\npriority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets and the lowest priority given to unobservable\ninputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments based on this\nthree-level hierarchy. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity\nsecurities and derivative contracts that are traded in an\nactive exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that are highly liquid and are actively traded\nin OTC markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other than\nLevel 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets\nor liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially\nthe full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2\nassets and liabilities include debt securities with\nquoted prices that are traded less frequently than\nexchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts\nwhere fair value is determined using a pricing model with\ninputs that are observable in the market or can be\nderived principally from or corroborated by observable\nmarket data. This category generally includes U.S.\ngovernment and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-\nbacked securities (ABS), corporate debt securities,\nderivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no\nmarket activity and that are significant to the overall\nfair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets\nand liabilities include financial instruments for which\nthe determination of fair value requires significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. The fair value for\nsuch assets and liabilities is generally determined using\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a\nmarket participant would use in pricing the asset or\nliability. This category generally includes retained\nresidual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs,\ncertain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated\nderivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and\ncertain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot\nbe obtained for a significant portion of the underlying\nassets. Income Taxes There are two components of income\ntax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax\nexpense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period. Deferred income tax expense results from\nchanges in deferred tax assets and liabilities between\nperiods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities\nrepresent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be\npaid in the future because of future reversals of\ntemporary differences in the bases of assets and\nliabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as\nreported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets\nare also recognized for tax attributes such as net\noperating loss carryforwards and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management\nconcludes are more likely than not to be realized. Income\ntax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a\ntwo-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be sustained based solely on its technical\nmerits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit\nis measured as the largest dollar amount of that position\nthat is more likely than not to be sustained upon\nsettlement. The difference between the benefit recognized\nand the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred\nto as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation\nrecords income tax-related interest and penalties, if\napplicable, within income tax expense. Revenue\nRecognition The following summarizes the Corporation\u2019s\nrevenue recognition accounting policies for certain\nnoninterest income activities. Card Income Card income\nincludes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as\ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items\nfrom credit and debit card transactions and from\nprocessing card transactions for merchants. Card income\nis presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are\nrecognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card\npayment transactions and are generally determined on a\npercentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for\ndebit cards based on the corresponding payment network\u2019s\nrates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the\ntransaction date, except for certain time-based fees such\nas annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees\ncharged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated\nto be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are\nrewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to\ncardholders are related to points earned by the\ncardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of\nrewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points\nto be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption\nbehavior, card product type, account\n                                                         \n  Bank of America108                                     \n                                                         \ntransaction activity and other historical card\nperformance. The liability is reduced as the points are\nredeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit\ncard partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing\nagreements that are generally driven by cardholder\ntransactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the\nrevenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner\nprovides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to\nthe credit card partner\u2019s members or customers on behalf\nof the Corporation. Service Charges Service charges\ninclude deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related\nfees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial\ndeposit activities and are generally recognized when the\ntransactions occur or as the service is performed.\nConsumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-based\nservices, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer\nactivities, check and money order processing and\ninsufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial\ndeposit-related fees are from the Corporation\u2019s Global\nTransaction Services business and consist of commercial\ndeposit and treasury management services, including\naccount maintenance and other services, such as payroll,\nsweep account and other cash management services.\nLending-related fees generally represent transactional\nfees earned from certain loan commitments, financial\nguarantees and SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage Services\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset\nmanagement and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are\nearned from the management of client assets under\nadvisory agreements or the full discretion of the\nCorporation\u2019s financial advisors (collectively referred\nto as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management\nfees are earned as a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and\ngenerally range from 50basis points (bps) to 150bps of\nthe AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a\nclient\u2019s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the\nthird party is recorded net and is not reflected in the\ntransaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for\nthose services. Brokerage fees include income earned from\ntransaction-based services that are performed as part of\ninvestment management services and are based on a fixed\nprice per unit or as a percentage of the total\ntransaction amount. Brokerage fees also include\ndistribution fees and sales commissions that are\nprimarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (\nGWIM ) segment and are earned over time. In addition,\nprimarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees\nare earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to\nbuy or sell various financial products or when it\nacknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions\nand/or submits trade information to the appropriate\nclearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage,\nclearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant\nregulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or\nclear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not\nreflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is\nan agent for those services. Investment Banking Income\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income\nand financial advisory services income. Underwriting\nconsists of fees earned for the placement of a customer\u2019s\ndebt or equity securities. The revenue is generally\nearned based on a percentage of the fixed number of\nshares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or\nnotes is determined and the service is completed, the\nunderwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in\nperforming these services. These expenses are recovered\nthrough the revenue the Corporation earns from the\ncustomer and are included in operating expenses.\nSyndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or\nlead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and\nadministering a loan syndication. Financial advisory\nservices consist of fees earned for assisting clients\nwith transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and\nfinancial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the\nsize of the transaction and scope of services performed\nand is generally contingent on successful completion of\nthe transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the\ntransaction is completed and all services have been\nrendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed\nfee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a\nfairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the\nopinion is delivered to the client. Other Revenue\nMeasurement and Recognition Policies The Corporation did\nnot disclose the value of any open performance\nobligations at December 31, 2020, as its contracts with\ncustomers generally have a fixed term that is less than\none year, an open term with a cancellation period that is\nless than one year, or provisions that allow the\nCorporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the\nright to invoice. Earnings Per Common Share Earnings per\ncommon share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income\nallocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding, excluding unvested common\nshares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income\nallocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted\nfor preferred stock dividends including dividends\ndeclared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock\nincluding accelerated accretion when preferred stock is\nrepaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the\ncurrent dividend period that have not been declared as of\nperiod end, less income allocated to participating\nsecurities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income\nallocated to common shareholders plus dividends on\ndilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock\nthat can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the\nweighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts\nrepresenting the dilutive effect of stock options\noutstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units\n(RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting\nfrom the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if\napplicable. Foreign Currency Translation Assets,\nliabilities and operations of foreign branches and\nsubsidiaries are recorded based on the functional\ncurrency of each entity. When the functional currency of\na foreign operation is the local currency, the assets,\nliabilities and operations are translated, for\nconsolidation purposes, from the local currency to the\nU.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for\nassets and liabilities and generally at average rates for\nresults of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and\nlosses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI,\nnet-of-tax. When the foreign entity\u2019s functional currency\nis the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or\nlosses on foreign currency-denominated assets or\nliabilities are included in earnings. Paycheck Protection\nProgram The Corporation is participating in the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP), which is a loan program that\noriginated from the CARES Act and was subsequently\nexpanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health\nCare Enhancement Act. The PPP is designed to provide U.S.\nsmall businesses with cash-flow assistance through loans\nfully guaranteed by the Small\n                                                         \n  109Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nBusiness Administration\n(SBA). If the borrower meets\ncertain criteria and uses\nthe proceeds towards certain\neligible expenses, the\nborrower\u2019s obligation to\nrepay the loan can be\nforgiven up to the full\nprincipal amount of the loan\nand any accrued interest.\nUpon borrower forgiveness,\nthe SBA pays the Corporation\nfor the principal and\naccrued interest owed on the\nloan. If the full principal\nof the loan is not forgiven,\nthe loan will operate\naccording to the original\nloan terms with the 100\npercent SBA guaranty\nremaining. As of December\n31, 2020, the\n\nCorporation had\napproximately 332,000PPP\nloans with a carrying value\nof $ 22.7billion. As\ncompensation for originating\nthe loans, the Corporation\nreceived lender processing\nfees from the SBA, which are\ncapitalized, along with the\nloan origination costs, and\nwill be amortized over the\nloans\u2019 contractual lives and\nrecognized as interest\nincome. Upon forgiveness of\na loan and repayment by the\nSBA, any unrecognized net\ncapitalized fees and costs\nrelated to the loan will be\nrecognized as interest\nincome in that period.\n                                                         \n  NOTE 2                                                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income             \n                                                         \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest\nincome and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue\nsource for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

referenced names were $ 2.8billion\nand $ 309.7billion at December 31, 2019.\nOffsetting of Derivatives The Corporation enters into\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.\n(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements\nwith substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative\ncounterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master\nnetting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of\ndefault by the counterparty, the right to liquidate\nsecurities held as collateral and to offset receivables\nand payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets\nderivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral\nheld with the same counterparty where it has such a\nlegally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nfollowing table presents derivative instruments included\nin derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by primary\nrisk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where\napplicable, on which these derivatives are transacted.\nBalances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the\napplication of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nTotal gross derivative assets and liabilities are\nadjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master netting\nagreements which include reducing the balance for\ncounterparty netting and cash collateral received or\npaid.

Interest rate, foreign exchange,\nequity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in\nthe Corporation's ALM and risk management activities. The\nCorporation maintains an overall interest rate risk\nmanagement strategy that incorporates the use of interest\nrate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic\ninterest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and\nforwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in\nearnings caused by interest rate volatility. The\nCorporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity\nand volatility so that movements in interest rates do not\nsignificantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a\nresult of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate\nassets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair\nvalue. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that\nare linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and\nliabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nunrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk,\nincluding interest rate risk, can be substantial in the\nmortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business\nis the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues\nwill be adversely affected by changes in market\nconditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate\nthe interest rate risk in mortgage banking production\nincome, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale\ncommitments and other derivative instruments, including\npurchased options, and certain debt securities. The\nCorporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest\nrate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement\ncontracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market\nrisks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated\nwith certain foreign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s investments in\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these\ncontracts will increase or decrease over their respective\nlives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.\nThe Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage\ncredit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit\nexposures. Credit derivatives include credit default\nswaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded\nin other income. Derivatives Designated as Accounting\nHedges The Corporation uses various types of interest\nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect\nagainst changes in the fair value of its assets and\nliabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and\nexchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also\nuses these types of contracts to protect against changes\nin the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,\n                                                         \n  113Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nand other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The\nCorporation hedges its net investment in consolidated\nnon-U.S. operations determined to have functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward\nexchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by\nissuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment\nhedges).\nFair Value Hedges\nThe following table summarizes information related to\nfair value hedges for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n                                                         \n                   \u2026                                     \n      \u2026    \u2026       \u2026                                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                $  \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                   \u2026                                     \n                   \u2026                                     \n                $  \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                         \n(1) Amounts are recorded in interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income.\n(2) In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the derivative amount\nincludes gains (losses) of $ 701million, $ 73million and\n$( 116) million in interest expense, $ 73million, $\n28million and $( 992) million in market making and\nsimilar activities, and $ 9million, $ 18million and $(\n79) million in accumulated OCI, respectively.

For terminated\ncash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority\nof the forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately 3years, with a maximum length of time for\ncertain forecasted transactions of 16years.\n                                                         \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026       G\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       (\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       R\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       in                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       A\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       O\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       on                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       D\u2026                         \u2026                   \n  \u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026    $  7\u2026    $  6\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026       2\u2026        \u2014        \u2014       9        \u2014       \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026       85       34        4       \u2026       -2       \u2026  \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  7\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026                                                      \n  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  22    $  9\u2026    $  4    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n  \u2026                                                      \n                                                         \n(1) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are\nrecorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statement\nof Income.\n\n(2) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are\nrecorded in compensation and benefits expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income.\n\n(3) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are\nrecorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

The net gains on IRLCs, which are not\nincluded in the table but are considered derivative\ninstruments, were $ 165million, $ 73million and $\n47million in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n(2) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in\nother income.\n\n(3) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in\nmarket making and similar activities.\n\n(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in\ncompensation and benefits expense.\nTransfers of Financial\nAssets with Risk Retained\nthrough Derivatives The\nCorporation enters into\ncertain transactions\ninvolving the transfer of\nfinancial assets that are\naccounted for as sales where\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred financial assets\nis retained through\nderivatives (e.g., interest\nrate and/or credit), but the\nCorporation does not retain\ncontrol over the assets\ntransferred. At both\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe Corporation had\ntransferred $ 5.2billion of\nnon-U.S. government-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party\ntrust and retained economic\nexposure to the transferred\nassets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection\nwith these transfers, the\nCorporation received gross\ncash proceeds of $\n5.2billion as of both\ntransfer dates. At December\n31, 2020 and 2019, the fair\nvalue of the transferred\nsecurities was $ 5.5billion\nand $ 5.3billion. Sales and\nTrading Revenue The\nCorporation enters into\ntrading derivatives to\nfacilitate client\ntransactions and to manage\nrisk exposures arising from\ntrading account assets and\nliabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to\ninclude these derivative\ninstruments in its trading\nactivities, which include\nderivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments.\nThe resulting risk from\nthese derivatives is managed\non a portfolio basis as part\nof the Corporation\u2019s Global\nMarkets business segment.\nThe related sales and\ntrading revenue generated\nwithin Global Markets is\nrecorded in various income\nstatement line items,\nincluding market making and\nsimilar activities and net\ninterest income as well as\nother revenue categories.\nSales and trading revenue\nincludes changes in the fair\nvalue and realized gains and\nlosses on the sales of\ntrading and other assets,\nnet interest income, and\nfees primarily from\ncommissions on equity\nsecurities. Revenue is\ngenerated by the difference\nin the client price for an\ninstrument and the price at\nwhich the trading desk can\nexecute the trade in the\ndealer market. For equity\nsecurities, commissions\nrelated to purchases and\nsales are recorded in the\n\u201cOther\u201d column in the Sales\nand Trading Revenue table.\nChanges in the fair value of\nthese securities are\nincluded in market making\nand similar activities. For\ndebt securities, revenue,\nwith the exception of\ninterest associated with the\ndebt securities, is\ntypically included in\n\nmarket making and similar\nactivities. Unlike\ncommissions for equity\nsecurities, the initial\nrevenue related to broker-\ndealer services for debt\nsecurities is typically\nincluded in the pricing of\nthe instrument rather than\nbeing charged through\nseparate fee arrangements.\nTherefore, this revenue is\nrecorded in market making\nand similar activities as\npart of the initial mark to\nfair value. For derivatives,\nthe majority of revenue is\nincluded in market making\nand similar activities. In\ntransactions where the\nCorporation acts as agent,\nwhich include exchange-\ntraded futures and options,\nfees are recorded in other\nincome. The following table,\nwhich includes both\nderivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments,\nidentifies the amounts in\nthe respective income\nstatement line items\nattributable to the\nCorporation\u2019s sales and\ntrading revenue in Global\nMarkets , categorized by\nprimary risk, for 2020, 2019\nand 2018.

For credit derivatives based on a portfolio\nof referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation\nmay not be required to make payment until a specified\namount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required\nto make payment up to a specified amount. Credit\nderivatives are classified as investment and non-\ninvestment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying referenced obligation. The Corporation\nconsiders ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade.\nNon-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative\ninstruments. The Corporation discloses internal\ncategorizations of investment grade and non-investment\ngrade consistent with how risk is managed for these\ninstruments.

credit derivatives. However,\nthe Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit\nderivatives based solely on the notional amount because\nthis measure does not take into consideration the\nprobability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount\nis not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure\nto these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to\ndefine risk tolerances and establish limits so that\ncertain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in\nthe table above include investments in securities issued\nby CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-\nlinked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily\nclassified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to\nmake any payments to the entities under the terms of the\nsecurities owned.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America116                                     \n                                                         \nCredit-related Contingent\nFeatures and Collateral The\nCorporation executes the\nmajority of its derivative\ncontracts in the OTC market\nwith large, international\nfinancial institutions,\nincluding broker-dealers\nand, to a lesser degree,\nwith a variety of non-\nfinancial companies. A\nsignificant majority of the\nderivative transactions are\nexecuted on a daily margin\nbasis. Therefore, events\nsuch as a credit rating\ndowngrade (depending on the\nultimate rating level) or a\nbreach of credit covenants\nwould typically require an\nincrease in the amount of\ncollateral required of the\ncounterparty, where\napplicable, and/or allow the\nCorporation to take\nadditional protective\nmeasures such as early\ntermination of all trades.\nFurther, as previously\ndiscussed on page 112, the\nCorporation enters into\nlegally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that\nreduce risk by permitting\ncloseout and netting of\ntransactions with the same\ncounterparty upon the\noccurrence of certain\nevents. Certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s derivative\ncontracts contain credit\nrisk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the\nform of ISDA master netting\nagreements and credit\nsupport documentation that\nenhance the creditworthiness\nof these instruments\ncompared to other\nobligations of the\nrespective counterparty with\nwhom the Corporation has\ntransacted. These contingent\nfeatures may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation\nas well as its\ncounterparties with respect\nto changes in the\nCorporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the\nmark-to-market exposure\nunder the derivative\ntransactions. At December\n31, 2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation held cash and\nsecurities collateral of $\n96.5billion and $\n84.3billion and posted cash\nand securities collateral of\n$ 88.6billion and $\n69.1billion in the normal\ncourse of business under\nderivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product\nmargining agreements where\nclients are permitted to\nmargin on a net basis for\nboth derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In\nconnection with certain OTC\nderivative contracts and\nother trading agreements,\nthe Corporation can be\nrequired to provide\nadditional collateral or to\nterminate transactions with\ncertain counterparties in\nthe event of a downgrade of\nthe senior debt ratings of\nthe Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral\nrequired depends on the\ncontract and is usually a\nfixed incremental amount\nand/or the market value of\nthe exposure. At December\n31, 2020, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based\non the terms of the\ncontracts, that the\nCorporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be\nrequired to post to\ncounterparties but had not\nyet posted to counterparties\nwas $ 2.6billion, including\n$ 1.2billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National\nAssociation (BANA).

The\nCorporation calculates\nvaluation adjustments on\nderivatives based on a\nmodeled expected exposure\nthat incorporates current\nmarket risk factors. The\nexposure also takes into\nconsideration credit\nmitigants such as\nenforceable master netting\nagreements and collateral.\nCDS spread data is used to\nestimate the default\nprobabilities and severities\nthat are applied to the\nexposures. Where no\nobservable credit default\ndata is available for\ncounterparties, the\nCorporation uses proxies and\nother market data to\nestimate default\nprobabilities and severity.\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment\n(CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives\n(excluding the effect of any related hedge activities),\nwhich are recorded in market making and similar\nactivities, for 2020, 2019 and 2018. CVA gains reduce the\ncumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby\ndecreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and\nDVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to\nderivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby\nincreasing the derivative assets balance. FVA gains\nrelated to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative\nFVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities\nbalance. FVA losses have the opposite impact.\n                                                         \n  Valuation                                              \n  Adjustments Gains

The Corporation also\npledged $ 168.2billion of loans with no related\noutstanding borrowings to secure potential borrowing\ncapacity with the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home\nLoan Bank.\nThe Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as\ncore and non-core based on loan and customer\ncharacteristics such as origination date, product type,\nLTV, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency\nstatus consistent with its current consumer and mortgage\nservicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated\nafter January 1, 2010, qualified under government-\nsponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines, or\notherwise met the Corporation\u2019s underwriting guidelines\nin place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All\nother loans are generally characterized as non-core loans\nand represent runoff portfolios. The Corporation has\nentered into long-term credit protection agreements with\nFNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $ 9.0billion and $\n7.5billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, providing full\ncredit protection on residential mortgage loans that\nbecome severely delinquent. All of these loans are\nindividually insured, and therefore the Corporation does\nnot record an allowance for credit losses related to\nthese loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Commercial\nnonperforming loans increased to $ 2.2billion at December\n31, 2020 from $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2019 with\nbroad-based increases across multiple industries.\nConsumer nonperforming loans increased to $ 2.7billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 from $ 2.1billion at December 31, 2019\ndriven by deferral activity, as well as the inclusion of\n$ 144million of certain loans that were previously\nclassified as purchased credit-impaired loans and\naccounted for under a pool basis. The table below\npresents the Corporation\u2019s nonperforming loans and leases\nincluding nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due\n90days or more at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nNonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans\nand leases as they are recorded at either fair value or\nthe lower of cost or fair value.

FICO scores\nare typically refreshed\nquarterly or more\n\nfrequently. Certain\nborrowers (e.g., borrowers\nthat have had debts\ndischarged in a bankruptcy\nproceeding) may not have\ntheir FICO scores updated.\nFICO scores are also a\nprimary credit quality\nindicator for the Credit\nCard and Other Consumer\nportfolio segment and the\nbusiness card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business\ncommercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio\nsegment, loans are evaluated\nusing the internal\nclassifications of pass\nrated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary\ncredit quality indicators.\nThe term reservable\ncriticized refers to those\ncommercial loans that are\ninternally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as\nSpecial Mention, Substandard\nor Doubtful, which are asset\nquality categories defined\nby regulatory authorities.\nThese assets have an\nelevated level of risk and\nmay have a high probability\nof default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all\nloans not considered\nreservable criticized. In\naddition to these primary\ncredit quality indicators,\nthe Corporation uses other\ncredit quality indicators\nfor certain types of loans.\nThe following tables present\ncertain credit quality\nindicators for the\nCorporation's Consumer Real\nEstate, Credit Card and\nOther Consumer, and\nCommercial portfolio\nsegments by class of\nfinancing receivables and\nyear of origination for

For\nmore information on the\ncriteria for classifying\nloans as TDRs, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles .\nConsumer Real Estate\nModifications of consumer\nreal estate loans are\nclassified as TDRs when the\nborrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulties and a\nconcession has been granted.\nConcessions may include\nreductions in interest\nrates, capitalization of\npast due amounts, principal\nand/or interest forbearance,\npayment extensions,\nprincipal and/or interest\nforgiveness, or combinations\nthereof. Prior to\npermanently modifying a\nloan, the Corporation may\nenter into trial\nmodifications with certain\nborrowers under both\ngovernment and proprietary\nprograms. Trial\nmodifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-\nmonth period during which\nthe borrower makes monthly\npayments under the\nanticipated\n\nmodified payment terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of the\ntrial period, the\nCorporation and the borrower\nenter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified\nas TDRs when the trial offer\nis made and continue to be\nclassified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the\nborrower enters into a\npermanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans\nof $ 372million that have\nbeen discharged in Chapter 7\nbankruptcy with no change in\nrepayment terms and not\nreaffirmed by the borrower\nwere included in TDRs at\nDecember 31, 2020, of which\n$ 102million were classified\nas nonperforming and $\n68million were loans fully\ninsured. Consumer real\nestate TDRs are measured\nprimarily based on the net\npresent value of the\nestimated cash flows\ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s\noriginal effective interest\nrate. If the carrying value\nof a TDR exceeds this\namount, a specific allowance\nis recorded as a component\nof the allowance for loan\nand lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real\nestate TDRs that are\nconsidered to be dependent\nsolely on the collateral for\nrepayment (e.g., due to the\nlack of income verification)\nare measured based on the\nestimated fair value of the\ncollateral, and a charge-off\nis recorded if the carrying\nvalue exceeds the fair value\nof the collateral. Consumer\nreal estate loans that reach\n180 days past due prior to\nmodification are charged off\nto their net realizable\nvalue, less costs to sell,\nbefore they are modified as\nTDRs in accordance with\nestablished policy.\nSubsequent declines in the\nfair value of the collateral\nafter a loan has reached 180\ndays past due are recorded\nas charge-offs. Fully-\ninsured loans are\n                                                         \n  125Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nprotected against principal loss, and therefore, the\nCorporation does not record an allowance for loan and\nlease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even\nafter they have been modified in a TDR. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, remaining commitments to lend additional\nfunds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a\nconsumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer\nreal estate foreclosed properties totaled $ 123million\nand $ 229million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The\ncarrying value of consumer real estate loans, including\nfully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings were in process at December 31, 2020 was $\n1.2billion. Although the Corporation has paused formal\nloan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for\noccupied properties, during 2020, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 182million of consumer real estate loans\ncompleted or which were in process prior to the pause in\nforeclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain government-\nguaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to\nother assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash\ninvesting activities and, accordingly, are not reflected\nin the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The table\nbelow presents the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nunpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average\npre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified in TDRs during 2020,\n2019 and 2018. The following Consumer Real Estate\nportfolio segment tables include loans that were\ninitially classified as TDRs during the period and also\nloans that had previously been classified as TDRs and\nwere modified again during the period.\n                                                         \n  Co\u2026                                                    \n  Re\u2026

Credit card\nand other consumer loan modifications generally involve\nreducing the interest rate on the account, placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months\nand canceling the customer\u2019s available line of credit,\nall of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes\nloan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held\nonly by the Corporation (internal programs).\nAdditionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications\nfor borrowers working with third-party renegotiation\nagencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire\nunsecured debt structures (external programs). The\nCorporation classifies other secured consumer loans that\nhave been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs,\nwhich are written down to collateral value and placed on\nnonaccrual status no

For more\ninformation on the\nCorporation's loan\nmodification programs\noffered in response to the\npandemic, most of which are\nnot TDRs, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles.\n\nCredit card and other\nconsumer loans are deemed to\nbe in payment default during\nthe quarter in which a\nborrower misses the second\nof twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of\nthe factors considered when\nprojecting future cash flows\nin the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses for credit card and\nother consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the\nCorporation estimates that\n13percent of new credit card\nTDRs and 19percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer\nTDRs may be in payment\ndefault within 12months\nafter modification.\nCommercial Loans\nModifications of loans to\ncommercial borrowers that\nare experiencing financial\ndifficulty are designed to\nreduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while\nproviding the borrower with\nan opportunity to work\nthrough financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy.\nEach modification is unique\nand reflects the individual\ncircumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that\nresult in a TDR may include\nextensions of\n\nmaturity at a concessionary\n(below market) rate of\ninterest, payment\nforbearances or other\nactions designed to benefit\nthe borrower while\nmitigating the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk exposure. Reductions in\ninterest rates are rare.\nInstead, the interest rates\nare typically increased,\nalthough the increased rate\nmay not represent a market\nrate of interest.\nInfrequently, concessions\nmay also include principal\nforgiveness in connection\nwith foreclosure, short sale\nor other settlement\nagreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the\nloan. At the time of\nrestructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the\nimpact, if any, on projected\ncash flows resulting from\nthe modified terms. If a\nportion of the loan is\ndeemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded\nat the time of\nrestructuring.\nAlternatively, a charge-off\nmay have already been\nrecorded in a previous\nperiod such that no charge-\noff is required at the time\nof modification. For more\ninformation on modifications\nfor the U.S. small business\ncommercial portfolio, see\nCredit Card and Other\nConsumer in this Note.\n                                                         \n  127Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nAt December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the Corporation had $\n1.7billion and $ 2.2billion\nof commercial TDRs with\nremaining commitments to\nlend additional funds to\ndebtors of $ 402million and\n$ 445million. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 218million and\n$ 207million at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. Loans Held-\nfor-sale The Corporation had\nLHFS of $ 9.2billion at both\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash and non-cash proceeds\nfrom sales and paydowns of\nloans originally classified\nas LHFS were $ 20.1billion,\n$ 30.6billion and $\n29.2billion for 2020, 2019\nand 2018, respectively. Cash\nused for originations and\npurchases of LHFS totaled\napproximately $ 19.7billion,\n$ 28.9billion and $\n28.1billion for 2020, 2019\nand 2018, respectively.\nAccrued Interest Receivable\nAccrued interest receivable\nfor loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\nwas $ 2.4billion and $\n2.6billion and is reported\nin customer and other\nreceivables on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nOutstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and\nfees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as\nnonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than\nthe end of the month in\nwhich the account becomes\n180 days past due, within 60\ndays after receipt of\nnotification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon\nconfirmation of fraud .\nDuring 2020, the Corporation\nreversed $ 512million of\ninterest and fee income\nagainst the income statement\nline item in which it was\noriginally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal\nbalance of the loan . For\nthe outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity,\ndirect/indirect consumer and\ncommercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming\nduring 2020, the Corporation\nreversed $ 44million of\ninterest and fee income at\nthe time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming\nagainst the income statement\nline item in which it was\noriginally recorded. For\nmore information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming\nloan policies, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles .\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses to be based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate\nof lifetime ECL inherent in\nthe Corporation\u2019s relevant\nfinancial assets. Upon\nadoption of the new\naccounting standard, the\nCorporation recorded a $\n3.3billion, or 32percent,\nincrease in the allowance\nfor credit losses on January\n1, 2020, which was comprised\nof a net increase of $\n2.9billion in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses\nand a $ 310million increase\nin the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The net\nincrease in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses\nwas primarily driven by a $\n3.1billion increase in\ncredit card as the\nCorporation now reserves for\nthe life of these\nreceivables. The increase in\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments included\n$ 119million in the consumer\nportfolio for the undrawn\nportion of HELOCs and $\n191million in the commercial\nportfolio. For more\ninformation on the\nCorporation's credit loss\naccounting policies\nincluding the allowance for\ncredit losses see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles . The\nallowance for credit losses\nis estimated using\nquantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a\nvariety of factors, such as\nhistorical loss experience,\nthe current credit\n\nquality of the portfolio and\nan economic outlook over the\nlife of the loan.\nQualitative reserves cover\nlosses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's\nassessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. The\nCorporation incorporates\nforward-looking information\nthrough the use of several\nmacroeconomic scenarios in\ndetermining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the\nforecasted life of the\nassets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic\nvariables such as gross\ndomestic product,\nunemployment rate, real\nestate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen each quarter\nand the weighting given to\neach scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including\nrecent economic events,\nleading economic indicators,\ninternal and third-party\neconomist views, and\nindustry trends. As of\nJanuary 1, 2020, to\ndetermine the allowance for\ncredit losses, the\nCorporation used a series of\neconomic outlooks that\nresulted in an economic\noutlook that was weighted\ntowards the potential of a\nrecession with some\nexpectation of tail risk\nsimilar to the severely\nadverse scenario used in\nstress testing. Various\neconomic outlooks were also\nused in the December 31,\n2020 estimate for allowance\nfor credit losses that\nincluded consensus\nestimates, multiple downside\nscenarios which assumed a\nsignificantly longer period\nuntil economic recovery, a\ntail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse\nscenario used in stress\ntesting and an upside\nscenario to reflect the\npotential for continued\nimprovement in the consensus\noutlooks. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes\nthat the U.S. unemployment\nrate at the end of 2021\nwould be relatively\nconsistent with the level as\nof December 2020, slightly\nabove 6.5percent.\nAdditionally, in this\neconomic outlook, U.S. gross\ndomestic product returns to\npre-pandemic levels in the\nearly part of 2022. The\nallowance for credit losses\nconsiders the impact of\nenacted government stimulus,\nincluding the COVID-19\nEmergency Relief Act of\n2020, and continues to\nfactor in the unprecedented\nnature of the current health\ncrisis. The Corporation also\nfactored into its allowance\nfor credit losses an\nestimated impact from\nhigher-risk segments that\nincluded leveraged loans and\nindustries such as travel\nand entertainment, which\nhave been adversely impacted\nby the effects of COVID-19,\nas well as the energy\nsector. The Corporation also\nholds additional reserves\nfor borrowers who requested\ndeferrals that take into\naccount their credit\ncharacteristics and payment\nbehavior subsequent to\ndeferral. The allowance for\ncredit losses at December\n31, 2020 was $ 20.7billion,\nan increase of $ 7.2billion\ncompared to January 1, 2020.\nThe increase in the\nallowance for credit losses\nwas driven by the\ndeterioration in the\neconomic outlook resulting\nfrom the impact of COVID-19.\nThe increase in the\nallowance for credit losses\nwas comprised of a net\nincrease of $ 6.4billion in\nthe allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a $\n755million increase in the\nreserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The increase in\nthe allowance for loan and\nlease losses was attributed\nto $ 418million in the\nconsumer real estate\nportfolio, $ 1.8billion in\nthe credit card and other\nconsumer portfolio, and $\n4.2billion in the commercial\nportfolio. Outstanding loans\nand leases excluding loans\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option decreased $\n53.9billion in 2020, driven\nby consumer loans, which\ndecreased $ 37.1billion\nprimarily due to a decline\nin credit card loans from\nreduced retail spending and\nhigher payments.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America128

course\nof business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019\nfinancing and investing\nneeds. The Corporation\nroutinely securitizes loans\nand debt securities using\nVIEs as a source of funding\nfor the Corporation and as a\nmeans of transferring the\neconomic risk of the loans\nor debt securities to third\nparties. The assets are\ntransferred into a trust or\nother securitization vehicle\nsuch that the assets are\nlegally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation\nand are not available to\nsatisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be\nused to settle obligations\nof the trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle. The\nCorporation also\nadministers, structures or\ninvests in other VIEs\nincluding CDOs, investment\nvehicles and other entities.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s use of VIEs,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples. The tables in\nthis Note present the assets\nand liabilities of\nconsolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\nin situations where the\nCorporation has continuing\ninvolvement with transferred\nassets or if the Corporation\notherwise has a variable\ninterest in the VIE. The\ntables also\n\npresent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\nresulting from its\ninvolvement with\nconsolidated VIEs and\nunconsolidated VIEs in which\nthe Corporation holds a\nvariable interest. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure is based on the\nunlikely event that all of\nthe assets in the VIEs\nbecome worthless and\nincorporates not only\npotential losses associated\nwith assets recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nbut also potential losses\nassociated with off-balance\nsheet commitments, such as\nunfunded liquidity\ncommitments and other\ncontractual arrangements.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure does not\ninclude losses previously\nrecognized through write-\ndowns of assets. The\nCorporation invests in ABS\nissued by third-party VIEs\nwith which it has no other\nform of involvement and\nenters into certain\ncommercial lending\narrangements that may also\nincorporate the use of VIEs,\nfor example to hold\ncollateral. These securities\nand loans are included in\nNote 4 \u2013 Securities or Note\n5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases and Allowance for\nCredit Losses. In addition,\nthe Corporation has used\nVIEs in connection with its\nfunding activities.\n                                                         \n  129Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nThe Corporation did not provide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2020, 2019 and\n2018 that it was not previously contractually required to\nprovide, nor does it intend to do so. The Corporation had\nliquidity commitments, including written put options and\ncollateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated\nVIEs of $ 929million and $ 1.1billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As\npart of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation\nsecuritizes a portion of the first-lien residential\nmortgage loans it originates or purchases from third\nparties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-\nsponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the\nGSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA- insured and U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage\nloans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with\nor shortly after origination or purchase, and the\nCorporation may also securitize loans held in its\nresidential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the\nCorporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial\nmortgages it originates or purchases from other entities.\nThe Corporation typically services the loans it\nsecuritizes. Further, the Corporation may retain\nbeneficial interests in the securitization trusts\nincluding senior and subordinate securities and equity\ntranches issued by the trusts.

Substantially all of these\nsecurities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after\nreceipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage\nloans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and\naccounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which\ntotaled $ 160million, $ 64million and $ 71million net of\nhedges, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are not\nincluded in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase\ndelinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which\nreduces the amount of servicing advances it is required\nto make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from\nsecuritization trusts to perform modifications.\nRepurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or\nsecuritization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans serviced for investors,\nincluding residential mortgage and home equity loans,\ntotaled $ 160.4billion and $ 192.1billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on\nserviced loans was $ 474million, $ 585million and $\n710million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nServicing advances on serviced loans, including loans\nserviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n2.2billion and $ 2.4billion at December 31, 2020 and\n2019. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements . During 2020, the Corporation\ncompleted the sale of $ 9.3billion of consumer real\nestate loans through GNMA loan securitizations. As part\nof the securitizations, the Corporation retained $\n8.4billion of MBS, which are classified as debt\nsecurities carried at fair value on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $ 704million\nwere recorded in other income in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home\nequity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the\nreserve for representations and warranties obligations\nand corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note\n12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, loans and leases in\nthe consolidated credit card trust included $ 7.6billion\nand $ 10.5billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using\nquoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2\nof the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests,\nprimarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity\nloans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to\nprovide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid\namortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges\nthat will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization\n                                                         \n  131Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nevents depend on the undrawn portion of the HELOCs,\nperformance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws\nand the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated\nand purchased credit card loans. The Corporation\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an\nundivided interest (seller\u2019s interest) in the\nreceivables, and holding certain retained interests\nincluding subordinate interests in accrued interest and\nfees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve\naccounts. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation\nissued new senior debt securities to third-party\ninvestors from the credit card securitization trust of $\n1.0billion, $ 1.3billion and $ 4.0billion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation held\nsubordinate securities issued by the credit card\nsecuritization trust with a notional principal amount of\n$ 6.8billion and $ 7.4billion. These securities serve as\na form of credit enhancement to the senior debt\nsecurities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the credit card\nsecuritization trust issued $ 161million, $ 202million\nand $ 650million, respectively, of these subordinate\nsecurities. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation\ntransfers securities, typically MBS, into\nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant\nongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust,\nand no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $\n39.0billion, $ 24.4billion and $ 22.8billion of\nsecurities during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSecurities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in market making and similar activities prior to\nthe resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on\nsale was recorded. Securities received from the\nresecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value\nof $ 6.1billion, $ 5.2billion and $ 4.1billion during\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019 and 2018,\nsubstantially all of the securities were classified as\ntrading account assets. All of the securities received as\nresecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as\ntrading account assets. Of the securities received as\nresecuritizations proceeds during 2020, $ 2.4billion, $\n2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were classified as trading\naccount assets, debt securities carried at fair value and\nHTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the\ntrading account securities and debt securities carried at\nfair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation\nadministers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated,\nlong-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain\nfinancing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates\nthat reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to\nthird-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity\ncommitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts,\nincluding those for which the Corporation was transferor,\ntotaled $ 3.5billion and $ 3.7billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019.

The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated\ncustomer VIEs totaled $ 2.3billion and $ 2.2billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, including the notional amount\nof derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in securities issued by\nthe VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The\nCorporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which\nhold diversified pools of fixed-income securities,\ntypically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund\nby issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party\nportfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers\nassets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs\nand may be a derivative\n                                                         \n  Bank of America132                                     \n                                                         \ncounterparty to the CDOs.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to\nconsolidated and\nunconsolidated CDOs totaled\n$ 298million and $\n304million at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. Investment\nVIEs The Corporation\nsponsors, invests in or\nprovides financing, which\nmay be in connection with\nthe sale of assets, to a\nvariety of investment VIEs\nthat hold loans, real\nestate, debt securities or\nother financial instruments\nand are designed to provide\nthe desired investment\nprofile to investors or the\nCorporation. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total\nassets of $ 494million and $\n104million. The Corporation\nalso held investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs with\ntotal assets of $ 5.4billion\nand $ 5.1billion at December\n31, 2020 and 2019. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure associated with\nboth consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment\nVIEs totaled $ 1.5billion\nand $ 1.6billion at December\n31, 2020 and 2019 comprised\nprimarily of on-balance\nsheet assets less non-\nrecourse liabilities.\nLeveraged Lease Trusts The\nCorporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged\nlease trusts totaled $\n1.7billion at both December\n31, 2020 and 2019. The\ntrusts hold long-lived\nequipment such as rail cars,\npower generation and\ndistribution equipment, and\ncommercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the\ntrusts and holds a\nsignificant residual\ninterest. The net investment\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to the\ntrusts in the unlikely event\nthat the leveraged lease\ninvestments become\nworthless. Debt issued by\nthe leveraged lease trusts\nis non-recourse to the\nCorporation. Tax Credit VIEs\nThe Corporation holds\ninvestments in\nunconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar\nentities that construct, own\nand operate affordable\nhousing, wind and solar\nprojects. An unrelated third\nparty is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing\nmember and has control over\nthe significant activities\nof the VIE. The Corporation\nearns a return primarily\nthrough the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the\nprojects. The maximum loss\nexposure included in the\nOther VIEs table was $\n22.0billion and $\n18.9billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk of loss\nis generally mitigated by\npolicies requiring that the\nproject qualify for the\nexpected tax credits prior\nto making its investment.\nThe Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in affordable\nhousing partnerships, which\nare reported in other assets\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, totaled $ 11.2billion\nand $ 10.0billion, including\nunfunded commitments to\nprovide capital\ncontributions of $\n5.0billion and $ 4.3billion\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The unfunded\ncommitments are expected to\nbe paid over the next five\nyears. During 2020, 2019 and\n2018, the Corporation\nrecognized tax credits and\nother tax\n\nbenefits from investments in\naffordable housing\npartnerships of $\n1.2billion, $ 1.0billion and\n$ 981million and reported\npretax losses in other\nincome of $ 1.0billion, $\n882million and $ 798million,\nrespectively. Tax credits\nare recognized as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s annual\neffective tax rate used to\ndetermine tax expense in a\ngiven quarter. Accordingly,\nthe portion of a year\u2019s\nexpected tax benefits\nrecognized in any given\nquarter may differ from\n25percent. The Corporation\nmay from time to time be\nasked to invest additional\namounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing\nproject. Such additional\ninvestments have not been\nand are not expected to be\nsignificant.

The Corporation offsets securities\nfinancing transactions with the same counterparty on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and the transactions\nhave the same maturity date. The Securities Financing\nAgreements table presents securities financing agreements\nincluded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal\nfunds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019. Balances are presented on\na gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty\nnetting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an\naggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements.

The\ndistributed amounts were $\n10.5billion and $\n10.6billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019. The carrying\nvalue of these commitments\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019, excluding commitments\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option, was\n\n$ 1.9billion and $\n829million, which primarily\nrelated to the reserve for\nunfunded lending\ncommitments. The carrying\nvalue of these commitments\nis classified in accrued\nexpenses and other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegally binding commitments\nto extend credit generally\nhave specified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse\nchange clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay.\nThe table below includes the\nnotional amount of\ncommitments of $ 4.0billion\nand $ 4.4billion at December\n31, 2020 and 2019 that are\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option. However, the\ntable excludes cumulative\nnet fair value of $\n99million and $ 90million at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\non these commitments, which\nis classified in accrued\nexpenses and other\nliabilities.

these loan commitments were held in the\nform of a security.\n\n(2) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial\nguarantees classified as investment grade and non-\ninvestment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $\n25.0billion and $ 10.2billion at December 31, 2020, and $\n27.9billion and $ 8.6billion at December 31, 2019.\nAmounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $\n500million and $ 413million at December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\n\n(3) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, included are letters\nof credit of $ 1.8billion and $ 1.4billion related to\ncertain liquidity commitments of VIEs. For more\ninformation, see Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other\nVariable Interest Entities .\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g.,\nresidential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $\n93million and $ 86million, which upon settlement will be\nincluded in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and\ncommitments to purchase commercial loans of $ 645million\nand $ 1.1billion, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities,\nprimarily liquefied natural gas, of $ 582million and $\n830million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and\nforward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements\nof $ 66.5billion and $ 97.2billion, and commitments to\nenter into forward-dated repurchase and securities\nlending agreements of $ 32.1billion and $ 24.9billion.\nThese commitments generally expire within the next 12\nmonths. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation\nhad a commitment to originate or purchase up to $\n3.9billion and $ 3.3billion on a rolling 12-month basis,\nof auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This\ncommitment extends through November 2022 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. Other Guarantees\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The\nCorporation sells products that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of these\nguarantees totaled $ 7.1billion and $ 7.3billion. At both\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation\u2019s maximum\nexposure related to these guarantees totaled $\n1.1billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033\nand 2039. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the Corporation enters into various agreements\nthat contain indemnifications, such as tax\nindemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if\ncertain external events occur, such as a change in tax\nlaw. The indemnification clauses are often standard\ncontractual terms and were entered into in the normal\ncourse of business based on an assessment that the risk\nof loss would be remote. These agreements typically\ncontain an early termination clause that permits the\nCorporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The\nmaximum potential future payment under indemnification\nagreements is difficult to assess for several reasons,\nincluding the occurrence of an external event, the\ninability to predict future changes in tax and other\nlaws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would\napply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure\nlimits contained in standard contract language and the\ntiming of any early termination clauses. Historically,\nany payments made under these guarantees have been de\nminimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of\nmaking such payments in the future as remote. Merchant\nServices Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of\nthe Corporation's merchant processing activity was\nperformed by a joint venture in which the Corporation\nheld a 49percent ownership interest. On July 29, 2019,\nthe Corporation gave notice to the joint venture partner\nof the termination of the joint venture upon the\nconclusion of its current term on June 30, 2020.\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its\nshare of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began\nperforming merchant processing services for these\nmerchants. While merchants bear responsibility for any\ncredit or debit card charges properly reversed by the\ncardholder, the Corporation, in its role as merchant\nacquirer, may be held liable for any reversed charges\nthat cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among\nother things, merchant fraud or insolvency.\n                                                         \n  139Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nThe Corporation, as a card network member bank, also\nsponsors other merchant acquirers, principally its former\njoint venture partner with respect to merchant contracts\ndistributed to that partner upon the termination of the\njoint venture. If charges are properly reversed after a\npurchase and cannot be collected from either the\nmerchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be\nheld liable for these reversed charges. The ability to\nreverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable\nregulatory and card network rules, which include, but are\nnot limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used\nand time limits. For the six-months ended December 31,\n2020, the Corporation processed an aggregate purchase\nvolume of $ 339.2billion. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this\narea primarily relates to circumstances where a\ncardholder has purchased goods or services for future\ndelivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by\nrequiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or\nother types of collateral from certain merchants. The\nCorporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and the\nlosses incurred related to the merchant processing\nactivity were not significant. The Corporation continues\nto monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential\neconomic impacts of COVID-19. Exchange and Clearing House\nMember Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses,\nboth in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the\nCorporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of\nthe losses incurred by some of these organizations as a\nresult of another member default and under other loss\nscenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in such exchanges and\nclearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the\nCorporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in\nlimited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the\nresidual losses after applying the guarantee fund. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these\nmembership agreements is difficult to estimate; however,\nthe Corporation has assessed the probability of making\nany such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage and\nSecurities Clearing Services In connection with its prime\nbrokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation\nperforms securities clearance and settlement services\nwith other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf\nof its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation\nstands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with\nrespect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s\nobligations in this respect are secured by the assets in\nthe clients\u2019 accounts and the accounts of their customers\nas well as by any proceeds received from the transactions\ncleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of\nclients or their customers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\npotential exposure under these arrangements is difficult\nto estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation\nto incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements\nis remote. Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears\ncertain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are\nsponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this program,\nthe Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of\nits sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee obligation is\nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral placed by clients with the\nclearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses under this\narrangement is remote. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\npotential exposure, without taking into consideration the\nrelated collateral, was $ 22.5billion and $ 9.3billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019. Other Guarantees The\nCorporation has entered into additional guarantee\nagreements and commitments, including sold risk\nparticipation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end\nobligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on\ncertain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees,\ndivested business commitments and sold put options that\nrequire gross settlement. The maximum potential future\npayments under these agreements are approximately $\n8.8billion and $ 8.7billion at December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations\nextend up to 2049. The Corporation has made no material\npayments under these guarantees. For more information on\nmaximum potential future payments under VIE-related\nliquidity commitments, see Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and\nOther Variable Interest Entities . In the normal course\nof business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the\nobligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-\nISDA related transactions such as commodities trading,\nrepurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and\nother transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by\ncertain statutory trust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS\nguaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-\ninsured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-\nguaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In\naddition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain\nsubsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential\nmortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label\nsecuritizations or in the form of whole loans. In\nconnection with these transactions, the Corporation or\ncertain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and\nhave made various representations and warranties.\nBreaches of these representations and warranties have\nresulted in and may continue to result in the requirement\nto repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole\nor provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors,\ninvestors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or\nother parties (collectively, repurchases). Unresolved\nRepurchase Claims Unresolved representations and\nwarranties repurchase claims represent the notional\namount of repurchase claims made by counterparties,\ntypically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid\nprincipal balance at the time of default. In the case of\nfirst-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often\nsignificantly\n                                                         \n  Bank of America140                                     \n                                                         \ngreater than the expected\nloss amount due to the\nbenefit of collateral and,\nin some cases, mortgage\ninsurance or mortgage\nguarantee payments. The\nnotional amount of\nunresolved repurchase claims\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019 was $ 8.5billion and $\n10.7billion. These balances\nincluded $ 2.9billion and $\n3.7billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019 of claims\nrelated to loans in specific\nprivate-label securitization\ngroups or tranches where the\nCorporation owns\nsubstantially all of the\noutstanding securities or\nwill otherwise realize the\nbenefit of any repurchase\nclaims paid. During 2020,\nthe Corporation received $\n89million in new repurchase\nclaims that were not time-\nbarred. During 2020, $\n2.4billion in claims were\nresolved, including $\n168million of claims that\nwere deemed time-barred.\nReserve and Related\nProvision The reserve for\nrepresentations and\nwarranties obligations and\ncorporate guarantees was $\n1.3billion and $ 1.8billion\nat December 31, 2020 and\n2019 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related provision is\nincluded in other income in\nthe Consolidated Statement\nof Income. The\nrepresentations and\nwarranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s\nbest estimate of probable\nincurred losses, is based on\nits experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject\nto judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or\nunknown uncertainties.\nFuture representations and\nwarranties losses may occur\nin excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these\nexposures; however, the\nCorporation does not expect\nsuch amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's\nfinancial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation\nand Regulatory Matters below\nfor the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible\nloss in excess of the\nreserve for representations\nand warranties and the\naccrued liability for\nlitigation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory\nMatters In the ordinary\ncourse of business, the\nCorporation and its\nsubsidiaries are routinely\ndefendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened\nlegal, regulatory and\ngovernmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate\ndamages or where the matters\npresent novel legal theories\nor involve a large number of\nparties, the Corporation\ngenerally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the\npending matters, timing of\nthe ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual\nloss, fines or penalties\nrelated to each pending\nmatter. As a matter\ndevelops, the Corporation,\nin conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the\nmatter, evaluates whether\nsuch matter presents a loss\ncontingency that is probable\nand estimable, and, for the\nmatters disclosed in this\nNote, whether a loss in\nexcess of any accrued\nliability is reasonably\npossible in future periods.\nOnce the loss contingency is\ndeemed to be both probable\nand estimable, the\nCorporation will establish\nan accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding\namount of litigation-related\nexpense. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the\nmatter for further\ndevelopments that could\naffect the amount of the\naccrued liability that has\nbeen previously established.\nExcluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal\nservice providers,\nlitigation-related expense\nof $ 823million and $\n681million was recognized in\n2020 and 2019. For the\nmatters disclosed in this\nNote for which a loss in\nfuture periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an\naccrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued\nliability) and for\nrepresentations and\nwarranties exposures, the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $\n0to $ 1.3\n\nbillion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any,\nas of December 31, 2020. The\naccrued liability and\nestimated range of possible\nloss are based upon\ncurrently available\ninformation and subject to\nsignificant judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown\nuncertainties. The matters\nunderlying the accrued\nliability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change\nfrom time to time, and\nactual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the\ncurrent estimate and\naccrual. The estimated range\nof possible loss does not\nrepresent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided\nbelow regarding the nature\nof the litigation and\nassociated claimed damages.\nBased on current knowledge,\nand taking into account\naccrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe\nthat loss contingencies\narising from pending\nmatters, including the\nmatters described herein,\nwill have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated\nfinancial condition or\nliquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in\nlight of the significant\njudgment, variety of\nassumptions and\nuncertainties involved in\nthese matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s\ncontrol, and the very large\nor indeterminate damages\nsought in some of these\nmatters, an adverse outcome\nin one or more of these\nmatters could be material to\nthe Corporation\u2019s business\nor results of operations for\nany particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Ambac\nBond Insurance Litigation\nAmbac Assurance Corporation\nand the Segregated Account\nof Ambac Assurance\nCorporation (together,\nAmbac) have filed four\nseparate lawsuits against\nthe Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries relating to\nbond insurance policies\nAmbac provided on certain\nsecuritized pools of HELOCs,\nfirst-lien subprime home\nequity loans, fixed-rate\nsecond-lien mortgage loans\nand negative amortization\npay option adjustable-rate\nmortgage loans. Ambac\nalleges that they have paid\nor will pay claims as a\nresult of defaults in the\nunderlying loans and asserts\nthat the defendants\nmisrepresented the\ncharacteristics of the\nunderlying loans and/or\nbreached certain contractual\nrepresentations and\nwarranties regarding the\nunderwriting and servicing\nof the loans. In those\nactions where the\nCorporation is named as a\ndefendant, Ambac contends\nthe Corporation is liable on\nvarious successor and\nvicarious liability\ntheories. These actions are\nat various procedural stages\nwith material developments\nprovided below. Ambac v.\nCountrywide I The\nCorporation, and several\nCountrywide entities are\nnamed as defendants in an\naction filed on September\n28, 2010 in New York Supreme\nCourt. Ambac asserts claims\nfor fraudulent inducement as\nwell as breach of contract\nand seeks damages in excess\nof $ 2.2billion, plus\npunitive damages. On May 16,\n2017, the First Department\nissued its decisions on the\nparties' cross-appeals of\nthe trial court's October\n22, 2015 summary judgment\nrulings. Ambac appealed the\nFirst Department's rulings\nrequiring Ambac to prove all\nof the elements of its\nfraudulent inducement claim,\nincluding justifiable\nreliance and loss causation;\nrestricting Ambac's sole\nremedy for its breach of\ncontract claims to the\nrepurchase protocol of cure,\nrepurchase or substitution\nof any materially defective\nloan; and dismissing Ambac's\nclaim for reimbursements of\nattorneys' fees. On June 27,\n2018, the New York Court of\nAppeals affirmed the First\nDepartment rulings that\nAmbac appealed.\n                                                         \n  141Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nOn December 4, 2020, the New York Supreme Court dismissed\nAmbac\u2019s fraudulent inducement claim. Ambac appealed the\ndismissal. Ambac v. Countrywide II On December 30, 2014,\nAmbac filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court against\nthe same defendants, claiming fraudulent inducement\nagainst Countrywide, and successor and vicarious\nliability against the Corporation. Ambac seeks damages in\nexcess of $ 600million, plus punitive damages. Ambac v.\nCountrywide IV On July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in\nNew York Supreme Court against Countrywide asserting the\nsame claims for fraudulent inducement that Ambac asserted\nin the now-dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The\ncomplaint seeks damages in excess of $ 350million, plus\npunitive damages. On December 8, 2020, the New York\nSupreme Court dismissed Ambac\u2019s complaint. Ambac appealed\nthe dismissal. Ambac v. First Franklin On April 16, 2012,\nAmbac filed an action against BANA, First Franklin and\nvarious Merrill Lynch entities, including Merrill Lynch,\nPierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in New York Supreme\nCourt relating to guaranty insurance Ambac provided on a\nFirst Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch.\nThe complaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of\ncontract, including breach of contract claims against\nBANA based upon its servicing of the loans in the\nsecuritization. Ambac seeks as damages hundreds of\nmillions of dollars that Ambac alleges it has paid or\nwill pay in claims. Deposit Insurance Assessment On\nJanuary 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging\nfailure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional\ndeposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount\nof $ 542million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013\nthrough December 31, 2014. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC\namended its complaint to add a claim for additional\ndeposit insurance and interest in the amount of $\n583million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through\nMarch 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on\nBANA\u2019s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures\nthat resulted in underpayment of assessments for those\nquarters and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a\nparallel investigation related to the same alleged\nreporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations as they existed during\nthe relevant time period and is defending itself against\nthe FDIC\u2019s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has\npledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the\ndisputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27,\n2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of\nColumbia denied BANA\u2019s partial motion to dismiss certain\nof the FDIC\u2019s claims. LIBOR, Other Reference Rates,\nForeign Exchange (FX) and Bond Trading Matters Government\nauthorities in the U.S. and various international\njurisdictions continue to conduct investigations of, to\nmake inquiries of, and to pursue proceedings against, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries regarding FX and other\nreference rates as well as government, sovereign,\nsupranational and agency bonds in connection with conduct\nand systems and controls. The Corporation is cooperating\nwith these inquiries and investigations, and responding\nto the proceedings. LIBOR The Corporation, BANA and\ncertain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as\ndefendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks\nin a number of individual and putative class actions by\npersons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-based financial instruments as a result of\ncollusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the\nsetting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety\nof claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO),\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and\nbreach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble\nand punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All but one\nof the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates\nrelating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. The\nDistrict Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and\ndismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America\nentities based on alleged trader conduct. The District\nCourt has also substantially limited the scope of\nantitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other\nclaims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain\nindividual and putative class plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust\nclaims for lack of standing and/or personal jurisdiction.\nPlaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed by the\nDistrict Court are pursuing appeals in the Second\nCircuit. Certain individual and putative class actions\nremain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain\nMerrill Lynch entities. On February 28, 2018, the\nDistrict Court granted certification of a class of\npersons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that\nreferenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar\nLIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of\nthe Sherman Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit subsequently denied a petition filed by the\ndefendants for interlocutory appeal of that ruling.

As a\nfinancial holding company,\nthe Corporation is subject\nto capital adequacy rules\nissued by\nthe Federal Reserve. The\nCorporation\u2019s banking entity\naffiliates are subject to\ncapital adequacy rules\nissued by the OCC. The\nCorporation and its primary\nbanking entity affiliate,\nBANA, are Advanced\napproaches institutions\nunder Basel 3. As Advanced\napproaches institutions, the\nCorporation and its banking\nentity affiliates are\nrequired to report\nregulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-\nweighted assets under both\nthe Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The\napproach that yields the\nlower ratio is used to\nassess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the Prompt\nCorrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation\nis required to maintain a\nminimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0\npercent plus a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments. The Corporation\u2019s\ninsured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum 6.0 percent SLR to\nbe considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA\nframework.

At December 31, 2020,\nthe Corporation's stress capital buffer of 2.5 percent\nwas applied in place of the capital conservation buffer\nunder the Standardized approach. The countercyclical\ncapital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum\nincludes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(4) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December\n31, 2020 and 2019 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3,\nincluding a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent.\nThe regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of\nboth period ends are the percent required to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\n(5) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs\nfrom the Standardized approach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the\nqualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(6) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain\nTier 1 capital deductions.\n\n(7) Supplementary leverage exposure for the Corporation\nat December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America146                                     \n                                                         \nThe capital adequacy rules\nissued by the U.S. banking\nregulators require\ninstitutions to meet the\nestablished minimums\noutlined in the table above.\nFailure to meet the minimum\nrequirements can lead to\ncertain mandatory and\ndiscretionary actions by\nregulators that could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s financial\nposition. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation and its banking\nentity affiliates were well\ncapitalized. In response to\nthe uncertainty arising from\nthe pandemic, the Federal\nReserve required all large\nbanks to suspend share\nrepurchase programs during\nthe second half of 2020,\nexcept for repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans, and to limit common\nstock dividends to existing\nrates that did not exceed\nthe average of the last four\nquarters\u2019 net income. In\nDecember 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that\nbeginning in the first\nquarter of 2021, large banks\nwould be permitted to pay\ncommon stock dividends at\nexisting rates and to\nrepurchase shares in an\namount that, when combined\nwith dividends paid, does\nnot exceed the average of\nnet income over the last\nfour quarters.

Other\nRegulatory Matters The\nFederal Reserve requires the\nCorporation\u2019s bank\nsubsidiaries to maintain\nreserve requirements based\non a percentage of certain\ndeposit liabilities. The\naverage daily reserve\nbalance requirements, in\nexcess of vault cash,\nmaintained by the\nCorporation with the Federal\nReserve Bank were $\n3.8billion for 2020,\nreflecting the Federal\nReserve's reduction of the\nreserve requirement to zero\nin the first quarter due to\nCOVID-19, and $ 14.6billion\nfor 2019. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation had cash and\ncash equivalents in the\namount of $ 4.9billion and $\n6.3billion, and securities\nwith a fair value of $\n16.8billion and $\n14.7billion that were\nsegregated in compliance\nwith securities regulations.\nCash held on deposit with\nthe Federal Reserve Bank to\nmeet reserve requirements\nand cash and cash\nequivalents segregated in\ncompliance with securities\nregulations are components\nof restricted cash. For more\ninformation, see Note 10 \u2013\nFederal Funds Sold or\nPurchased, Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-\nterm Borrowings and\nRestricted Cash . In\naddition, at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation had cash\ndeposited with clearing\norganizations of $\n10.9billion and $ 7.6billion\nprimarily recorded in other\nassets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Bank\nSubsidiary Distributions The\nprimary sources of funds for\ncash distributions by the\nCorporation to its\nshareholders are capital\ndistributions received from\nits bank subsidiaries, BANA\nand Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A. In 2020,\nthe Corporation received\ndividends of $ 10.3billion\nfrom BANA and $ 62million\nfrom Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A. The amount\nof dividends that a\nsubsidiary bank may declare\nin a calendar year without\nOCC approval is the\nsubsidiary bank\u2019s net\nprofits for that year\ncombined with its retained\nnet profits for the\npreceding two years.\nRetained net profits, as\ndefined by the OCC, consist\nof net income less dividends\ndeclared during the period.\nIn 2021, BANA can declare\nand pay dividends of\napproximately $ 10.3billion\nto the Corporation plus an\nadditional amount equal to\nits retained net profits for\n2021 up to the date\nof any such dividend\ndeclaration. Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A. can pay\ndividends of $ 198million in\n2021 plus an additional\namount equal to its retained\nnet profits for 2021 up to\nthe date of any such\ndividend declaration.\nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit\nPlans\n\nPension and Postretirement\nPlans The Corporation\nsponsors a qualified\nnoncontributory trusteed\npension plan (Qualified\nPension Plan), a number of\nnoncontributory nonqualified\npension plans, and\npostretirement health and\nlife plans that cover\neligible employees. Non-U.S.\npension plans sponsored by\nthe Corporation vary based\non the country and local\npractices. The Qualified\nPension Plan has a balance\nguarantee feature for\naccount balances with\nparticipant-selected\ninvestments, applied at the\ntime a benefit payment is\nmade from the plan that\neffectively provides\nprincipal protection for\nparticipant balances\ntransferred and certain\ncompensation credits. The\nCorporation is responsible\nfor funding any shortfall on\nthe guarantee feature.\nBenefits earned under the\nQualified Pension Plan have\nbeen frozen. Thereafter, the\ncash balance accounts\ncontinue to earn investment\ncredits or interest credits\nin accordance with the terms\nof the plan document. The\nCorporation has an annuity\ncontract that guarantees the\npayment of benefits vested\nunder a terminated U.S.\npension plan (Other Pension\nPlan). The Corporation,\nunder a supplemental\nagreement, may be\nresponsible for or benefit\nfrom actual experience and\ninvestment performance of\nthe annuity assets. The\nCorporation made\nnocontribution under this\nagreement in 2020 or 2019.\nContributions may be\nrequired in the future under\nthis agreement. The\nCorporation\u2019s\nnoncontributory,\nnonqualified pension plans\nare unfunded and provide\nsupplemental defined pension\nbenefits to certain eligible\nemployees. In addition to\nretirement pension benefits,\ncertain benefits-eligible\nemployees may become\neligible to continue\nparticipation as retirees in\nhealth care and/or life\ninsurance plans sponsored by\nthe Corporation. These plans\nare referred to as the\nPostretirement Health and\nLife Plans. The Pension and\nPostretirement Plans table\nsummarizes the changes in\nthe fair value of plan\nassets, changes in the\nprojected benefit obligation\n(PBO), the funded status of\nboth the accumulated benefit\nobligation (ABO) and the\nPBO, and the weighted-\naverage assumptions used to\ndetermine benefit\nobligations for the pension\nplans and postretirement\nplans at December 31, 2020\nand 2019. The estimate of\nthe Corporation\u2019s PBO\nassociated with these plans\nconsiders various actuarial\nassumptions, including\nassumptions for mortality\nrates and discount rates.\nThe discount rate\nassumptions are derived from\na cash flow matching\ntechnique that utilizes\nrates that are based on Aa-\nrated corporate bonds with\ncash flows that match\nestimated benefit payments\nof each of the plans. The\ndecreases in the weighted-\naverage discount rates in\n2020 and 2019 resulted in\nincreases to the PBO of\napproximately $ 1.9billion\nand $ 2.2billion at December\n31, 2020 and 2019.\nSignificant gains and losses\nrelated to changes in the\nPBO for 2020 and 2019\nprimarily resulted from\nchanges in the discount\nrate.\n                                                         \n  147Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n(1) The measurement date for all of the above plans was\nDecember 31 of each year reported.\nn/a = not applicable\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s estimate of its contributions to be\nmade to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and\nOther Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life\nPlans in 2021 is $ 29million, $ 93million and $\n14million, respectively.

Gains and losses\nfor all benefit plans except postretirement health care\nare recognized in accordance with the standard\namortization provisions of the applicable accounting\nguidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life\nexpense was determined using the \u201cprojected unit credit\u201d\nactuarial method. For the Postretirement Health and Life\nPlans, 50percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the\nbeginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is\nrecognized on a level basis during the year. Assumed\nhealth care cost trend rates affect the postretirement\nbenefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health\ncare cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of\nbenefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life\nPlans is 6.25percent for 2021, reducing in steps to\n5.00percent in 2026 and later years. The Corporation\u2019s\nnet periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the\nplans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected\nreturn on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan,\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension\nPlans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp\ndecline in discount rates and expected return on assets\nwould not have had a significant impact on the net\nperiodic benefit cost for 2020.\n                                                         \n                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  149Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nPlan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been\nestablished as a retirement vehicle for participants, and\ntrusts have been established to secure benefits promised\nunder the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2019s\npolicy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner\nfor the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to\nparticipants and defraying reasonable expenses of\nadministration. The Corporation\u2019s investment strategy is\ndesigned to provide a total return that, over the long\nterm, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The\nstrategy attempts to maximize the investment return on\nassets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the\nCorporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable\nregulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes\nasset allocation as a principal determinant for\nestablishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset\nallocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed\nand adjusted as funding levels and liability\ncharacteristics change. Active and passive investment\nmanagers are employed to help enhance the risk/return\nprofile of the assets. An additional aspect of the\ninvestment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the\nasset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of\nparticipant-selected investment measures. The assets of\nthe Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to\na U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are\ninvested prudently so that the benefits promised to\nmembers are provided with consideration given to the\nnature and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The\nselected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve\na higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The\nexpected rate of return on plan assets assumption was\ndeveloped through analysis of historical market returns,\nhistorical asset class volatility and correlations,\ncurrent market conditions, anticipated future asset\nallocations, the funds\u2019 past experience and expectations\non potential future market returns. The expected return\non plan assets assumption is determined using the\ncalculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension\nPlan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for\nthe Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and\nLife Plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption\nrepresents a long-term average view of the performance of\nthe assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S.\nPension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement\nHealth and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be\nachieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension\nPlan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is\nprimarily invested in fixed-income securities structured\nsuch that asset maturities match the duration of the\nplan\u2019s obligations. The target allocations for 2021 by\nasset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S.\nPension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans\nare presented in the following table. Equity securities\nfor the Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of\nthe Corporation in the amounts of $ 274million (\n1.26percent of total plan assets) and $ 315million (\n1.55percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2020\nand 2019.\n                                                         \n  2021                                                   \n  Target                                                 \n  Allocati\u2026                                              \n               Percentage                                \n               Qualified      Non-U.S.      Nonqualifi\u2026  \n  Asset        Pension        Pension       and Other    \n  Category     Plan           Plans         Pension      \n                                            Plans        \n  Equity       15-50%         0-25%         0-5%         \n  securiti\u2026                                              \n  Debt         45-80%         40-70%        95-100%      \n  securiti\u2026                                              \n  Real         0-10%          0-15%         0-5%         \n  estate                                                 \n  Other        0-5%           10-40%        0-5%         \n                                                         \nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements,\nincluding descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the\nCorporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements .

During 2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation granted 86million and 94million RSU awards to\ncertain employees under the KEEP. These RSUs were\nauthorized to settle predominantly in shares of common\nstock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in\ncash or contain settlement provisions that subject these\nawards to variable accounting whereby compensation\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the\nshare price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock up to the\nsettlement date. Of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019,\n61million and 71million will vest predominantly over\nthree yearswith most vesting occurring in one-third\nincrements on each of the first three anniversaries of\nthe grant date provided that the employee remains\ncontinuously employed with the Corporation during that\ntime, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting\nperiod, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement\neligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of\nthe shares. For RSUs granted to employees who are\nretirement eligible, the awards are deemed authorized as\nof the beginning of the year preceding the grant date\nwhen the incentive award plans are generally approved. As\na result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over\nthe year preceding the grant date. Additionally,\n25million and 23million of the RSUs granted in 2020 and\n2019 will vest predominantly over four yearswith most\nvesting occurring in one-fourth increments on each of the\nfirst four anniversaries of the grant date provided that\nthe employee remains continuously employed with the\nCorporation during that time, and will be expensed\nratably over the vesting period, net of estimated\nforfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the\nshares. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans\nwas $ 2.1billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 1.8billion, and the\nrelated income tax benefit was $ 505million, $ 511million\nand $ 433million for\n2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. At December\n31, 2020, there was an\nestimated $ 2.0billion of\ntotal unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to\ncertain share-based\ncompensation awards that is\nexpected to be recognized\nover a period of up to four\nyears, with a weighted-\naverage period of 2.2years.\nRestricted Stock and\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe total fair value of\nrestricted stock and\nrestricted stock units\nvested in 2020, 2019 and\n2018 was $ 2.3billion, $\n2.6billion and $ 2.3billion,\nrespectively.

The\nmajority of the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets, which\nconsist primarily of NOLs,\nare expected to be realized\nby certain subsidiaries over\nan extended number of years.\nManagement\u2019s conclusion is\nsupported by financial\nresults, profit forecasts\nfor the relevant entities\nand the indefinite period to\ncarry forward NOLs. However,\na material change in those\nestimates could lead\nmanagement to reassess such\nvaluation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, U.S.\nfederal income taxes had not\nbeen provided on\napproximately $ 5.0billion\nof temporary\ndifferences associated with investments in non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration.\nIf the Corporation were to record the associated deferred\ntax liability, the amount would be approximately $\n1.0billion. NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under\napplicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as\nthe exchange price that would be received for an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its financial instruments\nunder applicable accounting standards that require an\nentity to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation\ncategorizes its financial instruments into three levels\nbased on the established fair value hierarchy and\nconducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications\non a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if the significant\ninputs used in the financial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities become unobservable\nor observable in the current marketplace. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value hierarchy and how\nthe Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation\naccounts for certain financial instruments under the fair\nvalue option. For more information, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair\nValue Option . Valuation Techniques The following\nsections outline the valuation methodologies for the\nCorporation\u2019s assets and liabilities. While the\nCorporation believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or\nassumptions to determine the fair value of certain\nfinancial instruments could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. During\n2020, there were no significant changes to valuation\napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to\nhave, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations. Trading\nAccount Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The\nfair values of trading account assets and liabilities are\nprimarily based on actively traded markets where prices\nare based on either direct market quotes or observed\ntransactions. The fair values of debt securities are\ngenerally based on quoted market prices or market prices\nfor similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in\nthe determination of the fair values of trading account\nassets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price\nquotes may not be readily available for some positions\nsuch as positions within a market sector where trading\nactivity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of\nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow\nmodel, which estimates the fair value of the securities\nusing internal credit risk, and interest rate and\nprepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2019s best\nestimate of current key assumptions such as default\nrates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and\ninterest cash flows are discounted using an observable\ndiscount rate for similar instruments with adjustments\nthat management believes a market participant would\nconsider in determining fair value for the specific\nsecurity. Other instruments are valued using a net asset\nvalue approach which considers the value of the\nunderlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using\nexternal pricing services, where available, or matrix\npricing\n                                                         \n  Bank of America154                                     \n                                                         \nbased on the vintages and ratings. Situations of\nilliquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s\nperception of credit uncertainty regarding a single\ncompany or a specific market sector. In these instances,\nfair value is determined based on limited available\nmarket information and other factors, principally from\nreviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements and changes\nin credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities The fair values of\nderivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC\nmarket are determined using quantitative models that\nutilize multiple market inputs including interest rates,\nprices and indices to generate continuous yield or\npricing curves and volatility factors to value the\nposition. The majority of market inputs are actively\nquoted and can be validated through external sources,\nincluding brokers, market transactions and third-party\npricing services. When third-party pricing services are\nused, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the\nCorporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative\nasset and liability positions that are either option-\nbased or have longer maturity dates where observable\nmarket inputs are less readily available, or are\nunobservable, in which case, quantitative-based\nextrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used\nin determining fair values. The fair values of derivative\nassets and liabilities include adjustments for market\nliquidity, counterparty credit quality and other\ninstrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In\naddition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair\nvalue measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation\nadjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the\nnet position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and\nfair value for net long exposures is adjusted for\ncounterparty credit risk while the fair value for net\nshort exposures is adjusted for the Corporation\u2019s own\ncredit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within\nits fair value measurements to include funding costs on\nuncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the\nCorporation is not permitted to use the collateral it\nreceives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in\nthe determination of fair value, primarily based on\nmarket data. Loans and Loan Commitments The fair values\nof loans and loan commitments are based on market prices,\nwhere available, or discounted cash flow analyses using\nmarket-based credit spreads of comparable debt\ninstruments or credit derivatives of the specific\nborrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted\ncash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to\nreflect other market conditions or the perceived credit\nrisk of the borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair\nvalues of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-\nadjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This\napproach consists of projecting servicing cash flows\nunder multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting\nthese cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\nLoans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on\nquoted market prices, where available, or are determined\nby discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates\napproximating the Corporation\u2019s current origination rates\nfor similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit\nrisk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded\nwithin the quoted market prices or is implied by\nconsidering loan performance when selecting comparables.\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Corporation\nissues structured liabilities that have coupons or\nrepayment terms linked to the performance of debt or\nequity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. The fair values of these structured\nliabilities are estimated using quantitative models for\nthe combined derivative and debt portions of the notes.\nThese models incorporate observable and, in some\ninstances, unobservable inputs including security prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,\ncommodity or equity rates and correlations among these\ninputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its\nown credit spread in determining the discount rate used\nto value these liabilities. The credit spread is\ndetermined by reference to observable spreads in the\nsecondary bond market. Securities Financing Agreements\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed\ntransactions are determined using quantitative models,\nincluding discounted cash flow models that require the\nuse of multiple market inputs including interest rates\nand spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing\ncurves, and volatility factors. The majority of market\ninputs are actively quoted and can be validated through\nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions\nand third-party pricing services. Deposits The fair\nvalues of deposits are determined using quantitative\nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that\nrequire the use of multiple market inputs including\ninterest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield\nor pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority\nof market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated\nthrough external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. The\nCorporation considers the impact of its own credit spread\nin the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is\ndetermined by reference to observable credit spreads in\nthe secondary cash market. Asset-backed Secured\nFinancings The fair values of asset-backed secured\nfinancings are based on external broker bids, where\navailable, or are determined by discounting estimated\ncash flows using interest rates approximating the\nCorporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans\nadjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.\n

RMBS,\ncommercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial\nloans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs\nand CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities\nbacked by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities\nprimarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted\nfor under the fair value option. The Corporation uses\nmultiple market approaches in valuing certain of its\nLevel 3 financial instruments. For example, market\ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together.\nFor a given product, such as corporate debt securities,\nmarket comparables may be used to estimate some of the\nunobservable inputs and then these inputs are\nincorporated into a discounted cash flow model.\nTherefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these\ntechniques. The level of aggregation and diversity within\nthe products disclosed in the tables result in certain\nranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed\nacross asset and liability categories. Uncertainty of\nFair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs Loans\nand Securities A significant increase in market yields,\ndefault rates, loss severities or duration would have\nresulted in a significantly lower fair value for long\npositions. Short positions would have been impacted in a\ndirectionally opposite way. The impact of changes in\nprepayment speeds would have resulted in differing\nimpacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and,\nin the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be\nreinvested. A significant increase in price would have\nresulted in a significantly higher fair value for long\npositions, and short positions would have been impacted\nin a directionally opposite way. Structured Liabilities\nand Derivatives For credit derivatives, a significant\nincrease in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single\nupfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception),\ncredit spreads, default rates or loss severities would\nhave resulted in a significantly lower fair value for\nprotection sellers and higher fair value for protection\nbuyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would\nhave resulted in differing impacts depending on the\nseniority of the instrument. Structured credit\nderivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default\ncorrelation is a parameter that describes the degree of\ndependence among credit default rates within a credit\nportfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument.\nThe sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies\ndepending on the level of subordination of the tranche.\nFor senior tranches that are net purchases of protection,\na significant increase in default correlation would have\nresulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net short\nprotection positions would have been impacted in a\ndirectionally opposite way. For equity derivatives,\ncommodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and\nstructured liabilities, a significant change in long-\ndated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs\n(i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity\nsecurity and an index, between two different commodities,\nbetween two different interest rates, or between interest\nrates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in\na significant impact to the fair value; however, the\nmagnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether\nthe Corporation is long or short the exposure. For\nstructured liabilities, a significant increase in yield\nor decrease in price would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value. Nonrecurring Fair Value\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at\nfair value only in certain situations (e.g., the\nimpairment of an asset), and these measurements are\nreferred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below\nrepresent assets still held as of the reporting date for\nwhich a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded\nduring 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n                                                         \n  Ass\u2026                                                   \n  Mea\u2026                                                   \n  at                                                     \n  Fair                                                   \n  Val\u2026                                                   \n  on a       Dece\u2026                   Dece\u2026               \n  Non\u2026         31,                     31,               \n  Bas\u2026        2020                    2019               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Do\u2026       Level       Level       Level        Level  \n  in             2           3           2            3  \n  mil\u2026                                                   \n  Ass\u2026                                                   \n  Loa\u2026    $  1,020    $    792    $     53    $     102  \n  hel\u2026                                                   \n  Loa\u2026                                                   \n  and            \u2014         301           \u2014          257  \n  lea\u2026                                                   \n  For\u2026                                                   \n  pro\u2026           \u2014          17           \u2014           17  \n  3)                                                     \n  Oth\u2026         323         576         178          646  \n  ass\u2026                                                   \n                         Gains                           \n                         (Los\u2026                           \n                          2020        2019         2018  \n  Ass\u2026                                                   \n  Loa\u2026                $    -79    $    -14    $     -18  \n  hel\u2026                                                   \n  Loa\u2026                                                   \n  and                      -73         -81         -202  \n  lea\u2026                                                   \n  For\u2026                      -6          -9          -24  \n  pro\u2026                                                   \n  Oth\u2026                     -98       -2,1\u2026          -64  \n  ass\u2026                                                   \n                                                         \n(1) Includes $ 30million, $ 36million and $ 83million of\nlosses on loans that were written down to a collateral\nvalue of zero during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n(2) Amounts are included in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and represent the carrying\nvalue of foreclosed properties that were written down\nsubsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed\nproperties.

For more\ninformation, see Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\n(4) Reflects the measurement\nof the Corporation\u2019s\nmerchant services equity\nmethod investment on which\nthe Corporation recorded an\nimpairment charge in 2019.\nThe fair value of the\nmerchant services joint\nventure was measured using a\ndiscounted cash flow method\nfor which the two key\nassumptions were the\ncustomer attrition rate and\nthe cost-to-service rate.\n\nNOTE 21 Fair Value Option\nLoans and Loan Commitments\nThe Corporation elects to\naccount for certain loans\nand loan commitments that\nexceed the Corporation\u2019s\nsingle-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines\nunder the fair value option.\nLending commitments are\nactively managed and, as\nappropriate, credit risk for\nthese lending relationships\nmay be mitigated through the\nuse of credit derivatives,\nwith the Corporation\u2019s\npublic side credit view and\nmarket perspectives\ndetermining the size and\ntiming of the hedging\nactivity. These credit\nderivatives do not meet the\nrequirements for designation\nas accounting hedges and\ntherefore are carried at\nfair value. The fair value\noption allows the\nCorporation to carry these\nloans and loan commitments\nat fair value, which is more\nconsistent with management\u2019s\nview of the underlying\neconomics and the manner in\nwhich they are managed. In\naddition, the fair value\noption allows the\nCorporation to reduce the\naccounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from\nthe asymmetry created by\naccounting for the financial\ninstruments at historical\ncost and the credit\nderivatives at fair value.\nLoans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation elects to\naccount for residential\nmortgage LHFS, commercial\nmortgage LHFS and certain\nother LHFS under the fair\nvalue option. These loans\nare actively managed and\nmonitored and, as\nappropriate, certain market\nrisks of the loans may be\nmitigated through the use of\nderivatives. The Corporation\nhas elected not to designate\nthe derivatives as\nqualifying accounting\nhedges, and therefore, they\nare carried at fair value.\nThe changes in fair value of\nthe loans are largely\n\noffset by changes in the\nfair value of the\nderivatives. The fair value\noption allows the\nCorporation to reduce the\naccounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from\nthe asymmetry created by\naccounting for the financial\ninstruments at the lower of\ncost or fair value and the\nderivatives at fair value.\nThe Corporation has not\nelected to account for\ncertain other LHFS under the\nfair value option primarily\nbecause these loans are\nfloating-rate loans that are\nnot hedged using derivative\ninstruments. Loans Reported\nas Trading Account Assets\nThe Corporation elects to\naccount for certain loans\nthat are held for the\npurpose of trading and are\nrisk-managed on a fair value\nbasis under the fair value\noption. Other Assets The\nCorporation elects to\naccount for certain long-\nterm fixed-rate margin loans\nthat are hedged with\nderivatives under the fair\nvalue option. Election of\nthe fair value option allows\nthe Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility\nthat would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created\nby accounting for the\nfinancial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the\nderivatives at fair value.\nSecurities Financing\nAgreements The Corporation\nelects to account for\ncertain securities financing\nagreements, including resale\nand repurchase agreements,\nunder the fair value option.\nThese elections include\ncertain agreements\ncollateralized by the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies,\nwhich are generally short-\ndated and have minimal\ninterest rate risk.\n                                                         \n  163Bank of America                                     \n                                                         \nLong-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for\ncertain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits\nthat are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for\nhedge accounting. Election of the fair value option\nallows the Corporation to reduce the accounting\nvolatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at fair value. The\nCorporation has not elected to carry other long-term\ndeposits at fair value because they are not hedged using\nderivatives. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation elects\nto account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily\nshort-term structured liabilities, under the fair value\noption because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value\nbasis. The Corporation elects to account for certain\nasset-backed secured financings, which are also\nclassified in short-term borrowings, under the fair value\noption. Election of the fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from the asymmetry created by\naccounting for the asset-backed secured financings at\nhistorical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS\nsecuring these financings at fair value. Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term\ndebt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair\nvalue option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed\non a fair value basis or the related hedges do not\nqualify for hedge accounting. Fair Value Option Elections\nThe following tables provide information about the fair\nvalue carrying amount and the contractual principal\noutstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under\nthe fair value option at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and\ninformation about where changes in the fair value of\nassets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value\noption are included in

Global Banking also provides investment banking\nproducts to clients. The economics of certain investment\nbanking and underwriting activities are shared primarily\nbetween Global Banking and Global Markets under an\ninternal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking\nclients generally include middle-market companies,\ncommercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies,\nlarge global corporations, financial institutions,\nleasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses\nrequiring customized and integrated financial advice and\nsolutions. Global Markets Global Markets offers sales and\ntrading services and research services to institutional\nclients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity\nand equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-\nmaking, financing, securities clearing, settlement and\ncustody services globally to institutional investor\nclients in support of their investing and trading\nactivities. Global Markets product coverage includes\nsecurities and derivative products in both the primary\nand secondary markets.

As a result of market-making\nactivities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk\nin a broad range of financial products. In addition, the\neconomics of certain investment banking and underwriting\nactivities are shared primarily between Global Markets\nand Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing\narrangement. All Other All Other consists of ALM\nactivities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans\nand servicing activities, liquidating businesses and\ncertain expenses not otherwise allocated to business\nsegments. ALM activities encompass certain residential\nmortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign\ncurrency risk management activities. Substantially all of\nthe results of ALM activities are allocated to the\nbusiness segments. Basis of Presentation The management\naccounting and reporting process derives segment and\nbusiness results by utilizing allocation methodologies\nfor revenue and expense. The net income derived for the\nbusinesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations\nusing an activity-based costing model, funds transfer\npricing, and other methodologies and assumptions\nmanagement believes are appropriate to reflect the\nresults of the business. Total revenue, net of interest\nexpense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and\nnoninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income\nto an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in\nincome tax expense. The segment results also reflect\ncertain revenue and expense methodologies that are\nutilized to determine net income. The net interest income\nof the businesses includes the results of a funds\ntransfer pricing process that matches assets and\nliabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and\nmaturity characteristics. In segments where the total of\nliabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are\ngenerally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation\nallocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest\nincome of the business segments also includes an\nallocation of\n                                                         \n  Bank of America166                                     \n                                                         \nnet interest income generated by certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities. The Corporation\u2019s ALM\nactivities include an overall interest rate risk\nmanagement strategy that incorporates the use of various\nderivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations\nin earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest\nrate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\nThe results of substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s ALM\nactivities are allocated to the business segments and\nfluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities.\nALM activities include external product pricing decisions\nincluding deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the\nCorporation\u2019s internal funds transfer pricing process and\nthe net effects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses\nnot directly attributable to a specific business segment\nare allocated to the segments. The costs of certain\ncentralized or shared functions are allocated based on\nmethodologies that reflect utilization. The following\ntable presents net income (loss) and the components\nthereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis for the\nbusiness segments, All Other and the total Corporation)\nfor 2020, 2019
