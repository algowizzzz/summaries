Also included in the\neffective tax rate for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 was the discrete\nbenefit from the $700 million charge\nrecorded in the first quarter for the\nFDIC special assessment. Absent the tax\ncredits and discrete tax benefits, the\neffective tax rates would have been\napproximately 25 percent and 26 percent\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023 and 26 percent for both the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n   Supplemental Financial Data                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nwe present certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Non-GAAP financial measures\nexclude certain items or otherwise\ninclude components that differ from the\nmost directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures are provided as\nadditional useful information to assess\nour financial condition, results of\noperations (including period-to-period\noperating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures\nand may not be defined or calculated the\nsame way as non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common\n\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced by goodwill\nand intangible assets (excluding\nmortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net\nof related deferred tax liabilities\n(\u201cadjusted\u201d shareholders\u2019 equity or\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity). These\nmeasures are used to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition, profitability,\nrelationship and investment models use\nboth return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity and return on\naverage tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as\nkey measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 48.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends.

The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher asset\nmanagement fees due to higher average\nequity market valuations and positive\nAUM flows, partially offset by the\nimpact of lower AUM pricing.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $274\nmillion to $4.2 billion primarily due to\nhigher revenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 22 percent, up from 21 percent, due\nto higher net income.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile across all risk types\nagainst our risk appetite and risk\ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally\narticulated in the Risk Appetite\nStatement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A.

Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets (RWA) under both\nthe Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The lower of the capital\nratios under Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements is\nused to assess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the PCA framework. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital ratios under\nthe Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nJanuary 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2024, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements are 10.0\npercent under both the Standardized\napproach and the Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. Effective January 1, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is\nhigher under Method 2, increased 50 bps,\nresulting in an increase in our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nrequirement under the Standardized\napproach to 10.0 percent from 9.5\npercent. At June 30, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nJune 30, 2024, our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries exceeded their\nrequirement to\n\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.

five-year transition period\nrelated to the adoption of the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard on January 1, 2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum\nis the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 3.0 percent at June 30,\n2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,\n2023, and our capital conservation\nbuffer (under the Advanced approaches)\nor SCB (under the Standardized approach)\nof 2.5 percent, as applicable. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer was zero\nfor both periods. The SLR regulatory\nminimum includes a leverage buffer of\n2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, CET1 capital was\n$198.1 billion, an increase of $3.2\nbillion from December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital increased $1.3 billion primarily\ndriven by the same factors as CET1\ncapital, partially offset by preferred\nstock redemptions. Total capital under\nthe Standardized approach increased $35\nmillion primarily due to the same\nfactors driving the increase in Tier 1\ncapital and an increase in the adjusted\nallowance for\n\ncredit losses included in Tier 2\ncapital, largely offset by a decrease in\nsubordinated debt. RWA under the\nStandardized approach, which yielded the\nlower CET1 capital ratio at June 30,\n2024, increased $10.2 billion during\n2024 to $1,661 billion primarily driven\nby client activity in Global Markets and\nlending activity in GWIM . Supplementary\nleverage exposure at June 30, 2024\nincreased $80.2 billion primarily driven\nby increased activity in Global Markets\nand ALM activities in All Other.\n

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage market\nfluctuations from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding and\nliquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access to\nfunding sources,\n                                                                                  \n  25Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nminimizes borrowing costs and\nfacilitates timely responses to\nliquidity events.

These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity\nSources and Other Unencumbered Assets We\nmaintain liquidity available to the\nCorporation, including the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, in the form of\ncash and high- quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of assets\nthat are readily available to the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, including\nholding company, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the\n\nFederal Reserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained by borrowing\nagainst this pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was $317\nbillion and $312 billion at June 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. We have\nestablished operational procedures to\nenable us to borrow against these\nassets, including regularly monitoring\nour total pool of eligible loans and\nsecurities collateral. Eligibility is\ndefined in guidelines from the FHLBs and\nthe Federal Reserve and is subject to\nchange at their discretion. Due to\nregulatory restrictions, liquidity\ngenerated by the bank subsidiaries can\ngenerally be used only to fund\nobligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 14 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n                    Average Global                                                \n  Table 14          Liquidity                 Three Months                        \n  (Dollars in       Sources                          Ended           December 31  \n  billions)         Composition               June 30 2024                  2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                              $               344    $              380  \n  deposit                                                                         \n  U.S. Treasury                                        256                   197  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-back\u2026                                                                  \n  securities,                                          286                   299  \n  and other                                                                       \n  investment-gr\u2026                                                                  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                            23                    21  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               909    $              897  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR) rules.

Deposits at June 30,\n2024 decreased $13.3 billion from\nDecember 31, 2023 primarily due to\nseasonal deposit outflows and customers\u2019\nmovement of balances to higher yielding\ninvestment alternatives, partially\noffset by time deposit growth.\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, rates paid on deposits\nwere 60 bps and 22 bps in Consumer\nBanking , 314 bps and 235 bps in GWIM ,\nand 318 bps and 224 bps in Global\nBanking .

We may, from time to time,\npurchase outstanding debt instruments in\nvarious transactions, depending on\nmarket conditions, liquidity and other\nfactors. Our other regulated entities\nmay also make markets in our debt\ninstruments to provide liquidity for\ninvestors.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2024, we issued $14.2 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ninstruments, so that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt.

balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\nremained relatively unchanged during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat June 30, 2024, $1.3 billion, or 63\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more of $987 million also\nremained relatively unchanged.\n\nOf the $217.4 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat June 30, 2024, $63.5 billion, or 29\npercent, of loans were originated as\ninterest-only. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.5 billion, or six percent,\nat June 30, 2024. Residential mortgage\nloans that have entered the amortization\nperiod generally experience a higher\nrate of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At June 30, 2024,\n\n$49 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $987\nmillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at June 30,\n2024, $197 million, or six percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered the\namortization period were nonperforming,\nof which $75 million were contractually\ncurrent. Loans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-collateralized loans to\nour wealth management clients and have\nan interest-only period of three years\nto 10 years. Substantially all of these\nloans that have yet to enter the\namortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until\n2026 or later.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America30                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at June\n30, 2024, $253 million, or 60 percent,\nwere current on contractual payments. In\naddition, $94 million, or 22 percent,\nwere 180 days or more past due and had\nbeen written down to the estimated fair\nvalue of the collateral, less costs to\nsell. Accruing loans that were 30 days\nor more past d ue remained relatively\nunchanged d uring the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024.\n\nOf the $25.4 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at June\n30, 2024, as shown in Table 21, 10\npercent require interest-only payments.\nThe outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhad reached the end of their draw period\nand\n\nentered the amortization period was $3.6\nbillion at June 30, 2024. The HELOCs\nthat have entered the amortization\nperiod have experienced a higher\npercentage of early stage delinquencies\nand nonperforming status when compared\nto the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At\nJune 30, 2024, $36 million, or one\npercent, of outstanding HELOCs that had\nentered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more. In\naddition, at June 30, 2024, $262\nmillion, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod.

\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type.

Commercial net charge-offs\nincreased $325 million and $641 million\nto $474 million and $944 million during\nthe three and six months ended June 30,\n2024 compared to the same periods in\n2023 primarily due to higher losses in\nthe commercial real estate office\nportfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2023; however, we are\nclosely monitoring emerging trends and\nborrower performance in the higher\ninterest rate environment. Recent demand\nfor office space has been stagnant, and\nfuture demand for office space continues\nto be uncertain as companies evaluate\nspace needs with employment models that\nutilize a mix of remote and conventional\noffice use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $98 million\nduring the six months ended June 30,\n2024 to $4.7 billion.

During the six months ended June\n30, 2024, nonperforming commercial loans\nand leases increased $29 million to $2.8\nbillion. At June 30, 2024, 94 percent of\ncommercial nonperforming loans, leases\nand foreclosed properties were secured,\nand 42 percent were contractually\ncurrent. Commercial nonperforming loans\nwere carried at 79 percent of their\nunpaid principal balance, as the\ncarrying value of these loans has been\nreduced to the estimated collateral\nvalue less costs to

For information on net\nnotional credit protection purchased to\nhedge funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option,\nas well as certain other credit\nexposures, see Commercial Portfolio\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Risk\nMitigation.\n\nCommercial credit exposure is\ndiversified across a broad range of\nindustries. Total commercial committed\nexposure increased $8.0 billion during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024 to\n$1.2 trillion. The increase in\ncommercial committed exposure was\nconcentrated in Asset managers and\nfunds, Software and services and\nConsumer services.\n\nFor information on industry limits, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Risk Mitigation in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $174.3 billion, increased\n$5.0 billion, or three percent, during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024,\nwhich was primarily driven by\ninvestment-grade exposures.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry\nconcentration with committed exposure of\n$97.3 billion decreased $3.0 billion or\nthree percent during the six months\nended June 30, 2024. For more\ninformation on the commercial real\nestate and related portfolios, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Commercial Real Estate on\npage 36.\n\nCapital goods, our third largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $92.2 billion, decreased\n$4.8 billion, or five percent, during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024. The\ndecline in committed exposure was\nprimarily due to decreases in Industrial\nconglomerates and Aerospace and defense,\npartially offset by an increase in\nBuilding products.\n\nVarious macroeconomic challenges,\nincluding geopolitical tensions,\ninflationary pressures and elevated\ninterest rates, have led to uncertainty\nin the U.S. and global economies and\nhave adversely impacted, and may\ncontinue to adversely impact, a number\nof industries.

To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. At June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, net notional credit\ndefault protection purchased in our\ncredit derivatives portfolio to hedge\nour funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option,\nas well as certain other credit\nexposures, was $10.4 billion and $10.9\nbillion. We recorded net gains of $9\nmillion and net losses of $16 million\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2024 compared to net losses of $34\nmillion and $111 million for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023. The\ngains and losses on these instruments\nwere largely offset by gains and losses\non the\n\nrelated exposures. The Value-at-Risk\n(VaR) results for these exposures are\nincluded in the fair value option\nportfolio information in Table 38. For\nmore information, see Trading Risk\nManagement on page 42.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic\nand political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in\ngovernment policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor\nand manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing\nbusiness in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g.,\nrelated to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to\nclient clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal\ncourse of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather\nthan through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit\nand trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our\nnon-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 35 presents our 20\nlargest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2024. These exposures accounted for\n89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $10.0 billion in 2024\nprimarily driven by an increase in the United Kingdom.\n

For more information on market\nrisks, see the Market section within\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 38 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio.

sensitive to a\nparallel upward move in interest rates,\nwith the majority of that impact coming\nfrom the short end of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates\nnegatively impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities classified as available\nfor sale and adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from banking\nbook activities. For more information on\nBasel 3, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Capital on page 21.\n\nAs part of our ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The\nsensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes\nthat we take no action in response to\nthese rate shocks and does not assume\nany change in other macroeconomic\nvariables normally correlated with\nchanges in interest rates. Beginning in\nthe second quarter of 2024, the\nsensitivity analysis incorporates\npotential movements in customer behavior\nthat could result in changes in both\ntotal customer deposit balances and\ndeposit balance mix, (e.g., interest\nbearing versus noninterest bearing),\nunder the various interest rate\nscenarios. In higher rate scenarios, the\nanalysis assumes that a portion of low-\ncost or noninterest-bearing deposits are\nreplaced with higher yielding deposits\nor market-based funding. Conversely, in\nlower rate scenarios, the analysis\nassumes that a portion of higher\nyielding deposits or market-based\nfunding are replaced with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits.\n\nFor larger interest rate scenarios, the\ninterest rate sensitivity may behave in\na non-linear manner as there are\nnumerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing is\nrate sensitive in nature. This\nsensitivity is assumed to have non-\nlinear impacts to larger short-end rate\nmovements. In decreasing interest rate\nscenarios, and particularly where\ninterest rates have decreased to small\namounts, the ability to further reduce\nrates paid is reduced as customer rates\nnear zero. In higher short-end rate\nscenarios, deposit pricing will likely\nincrease at a faster rate, leading to\nincremental interest expense and\nreducing asset sensitivity. While the\nimpact related to the above assumptions\nused in the asset sensitivity analysis\ncan provide directional analysis on how\nnet interest income will be impacted in\nchanging environments, the ultimate\nimpact is dependent upon the\ninterrelationship of the assumptions and\nfactors, which vary in different\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\n                                                                                  \n  Economic Value of Equity                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to interest rate sensitivity\ndescribed above, the Corporation\u2019s\nmanagement of its interest rate\nexposures in the banking book also\nconsiders a long-term view of interest\nrate sensitivity through the measurement\nof Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE\ncaptures changes in the net present\nvalue of banking book assets and\nliabilities under various interest rate\nscenarios and its impact to Tier 1\ncapital. Similar to net interest income,\nthe Corporation establishes limits for\nEVE. EVE is largely driven by the\nCorporation\u2019s longer duration fixed-rate\nproducts, such as investment securities,\nresidential mortgages and deposits. For\nassets or liabilities that have no\nstated maturity, such as deposits, the\nCorporation estimates the duration for\nmeasurement purposes.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 41.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant.

Climate-related\nrisks are divided into two major\ncategories, both of which span across\nthe seven key risk types discussed in\nthe Managing Risk section in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K: (1) Physical Risk: risks\nrelated to the physical impacts of\nclimate change, driven by extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes and\nfloods, as well as chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2)\nTransition Risk: risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor vendors. Transition risks of climate\nchange may amplify credit risks through\nthe financial impacts of changes in\npolicy, technology or the market on the\nCorporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk.\n\nReputational risk can arise if we do not\nmeet our climate-related goals and/or\ntargets, or are perceived to be\ninadequately responsive to climate\nchange or otherwise.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the Enterprise\nRisk Committee (ERC) and the Corporate\nGovernance, ESG and Sustainability\nCommittee (CGESC) of the Board, which\nregularly discuss climate-related\ntopics. The ERC oversees climate risk as\nset forth in our Risk Framework and Risk\nAppetite Statement. The CGESC is\nresponsible for overseeing the\nCorporation\u2019s environmental and\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s climate-related policies\nand practices. Our Climate Risk Council\nconsists of leaders across risk, Front\nLine Unit and control functions, and\nmeets routinely to discuss our approach\nto managing climate-related risks.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by an officer who reports to\nthe Chief Risk Officer. The Corporation\nhas a Climate and Environmental Risk\nManagement function that is responsible\nfor overseeing climate risk management.\nThey are responsible for establishing\nthe Climate Risk Framework (described\nbelow) and governance structure, and\nproviding an independent assessment of\nenterprise-wide climate risks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, in 2023 we created our\ninternal Climate Risk Framework, which\naddresses how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes and\nalso includes examples of how climate\nrisk manifests across the seven risk\ntypes. The framework details the roles\nand responsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense (i.e., Front Line Units, Global\nRisk Management and Corporate Audit).\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see the Managing Risk section\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

As part of\nthis goal, we have set interim 2030\ntargets across our financing activities\nrelated to certain high-emitting sectors\n(2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets), operations and supply chain,\nall of which are further supported and\ncomplemented by our 10-year goal to\nmobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in\nsustainable finance by 2030 in support\nof the U.N.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \nSustainable Development Goals, of which\n$1 trillion is dedicated to supporting\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding capital mobilized across clean\nenergy sectors and tailored financial\nsolutions for emerging areas of the low-\ncarbon economy. In particular, we have\nannounced 2030 Financing Activity\nEmissions Targets for auto\nmanufacturing, aviation, cement, energy,\niron and steel, maritime shipping and\npower generation sectors. Achieving our\nclimate--related goals and targets,\nincluding our Net Zero goal and 2030\nFinancing Activity Emissions Targets,\nmay require technological advances,\nclearly defined roadmaps for industry\nsectors and better emissions data\nreporting. Required changes may also\ninclude new standards and public\npolicies, including those that improve\nthe cost of capital for the transition\nto a low-carbon economy, as well as\nstrong and active engagement with\ncustomers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.

      \nNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise\n\nsignificant influence over operating and\nfinancing decisions using the equity\nmethod of accounting. These investments,\nwhich include the Corporation\u2019s\ninterests in affordable housing and\nrenewable energy partnerships, are\nrecorded in other assets. Equity method\ninvestments are subject to impairment\ntesting, and the Corporation\u2019s\nproportionate share of income or loss is\nincluded in other income. The\npreparation of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect reported amounts\nand disclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates\nand assumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the Corporation\u2019s\nbusiness is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a full year.\nIn the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC).\n                                                                                  \n  53Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                               \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023.

Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The\nfollowing table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Of\nthe $ 7.7billion after-tax net loss ($ 10.3billion pretax) on derivatives in\naccumulated OCI at June 30, 2024, losses of $ 3.7billion after-tax ($ 4.9billion\npretax) related to both open and closed cash flow hedges are expected to be\nreclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified\ninto earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to\nthe respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time\nover which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately nine years. For\nterminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted\ntransactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years,\nwith the aggregated amount beyond this

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 4.0billion and $ 4.1billion of non-U.S. government-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic\nexposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection\nwith these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.1billion\nand $ 4.2billion at the transfer dates. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe fair value of the transferred securities was $ 3.9billion and $ 4.1billion.\nSales and Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to\nfacilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading\naccount assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and\nnon-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global Markets business\nsegment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The following table, which includes both derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective\nincome statement line items attributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading\nrevenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral Certain\nof the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit\nsupport documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of\nthe Corporation as well as its\n                                                                                  \n  61Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncounterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and\nthe mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $\n102.5billion and $ 104.1billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $\n89.8billion and $ 93.4billion in the normal course of business under derivative\nagreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nFor more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. At June 30, 2024, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 2.4billion, including $ 1.2billion for Bank of America,\nNational Association. Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally\nterminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be\nrequired to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a\nguarantee. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability recorded for\nthese derivative contracts was not significant. The following table presents the\namount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at June 30, 2024 if the rating\nagencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second\nincremental notch.

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 residential mortgage included $\n125million and $ 156million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 86million and $ 96million of\nloans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at June\n30, 2024.\n

Effective January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting standard on loan modifications.\nAccordingly, June 30, 2024 balances presented in payment status tables represent\nloans that were modified over the last 12 months, and June 30, 2023 balances\npresented in payment status tables represent loans that were modified during the\nfirst half of 2023. Consumer Real Estate The following modification programs are\noffered for consumer real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Residential mortgage modifications represented 0.04percent and\n0.07percent of outstanding residential mortgage loans for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.14percent and 0.19percent for the same periods\nin 2023. Home equity modifications represented 0.04percent and 0.07percent of\noutstanding home equity loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\ncompared to 0.19percent and 0.28percent for the same periods in 2023. Forbearance\nand Other Payment Plans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation\nsuspending the borrower\u2019s\n\npayments for a defined period with those payments then due over a defined period\nof time or at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan\nis generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. If a borrower is\nunable to fulfill their obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be\noffered a trial offer or permanent modification. Trial Offer and Permanent\nModifications : Trial offer for modification plans generally consist of the\nCorporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that reduce their contractual\npayments temporarily over a three-to- four-monthtrial period. If the customer\nsuccessfully makes the modified payments during the trial period and formally\naccepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become permanent. Some\nborrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a trial period. In a\npermanent modification, the borrower\u2019s payment terms are typically modified in\nmore than one manner but generally include a term extension and an interest rate\nreduction. At times, the permanent modification may also include principal\nforgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts to the\nend of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the terms\nthat give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual obligations.\nThe term extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity permanent\nmodifications vary widely and can be up to 30years, but are mostly in the range of\n1to 20years. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were insignificant during\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

The carrying value of consumer real estate\nloans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $ 588million and $\n633million. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 56million and $ 68million of consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are\nnot reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other\nConsumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest\nrate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months, most of which had a\n60-monthterm at June 30, 2024. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will\nforgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to\na set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for\nloans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party\nrenegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt\nstructures (external programs). The June 30, 2024 amortized cost of credit card\nand other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2024 was $ 200million and $ 401million\ncompared to $ 168million and $ 303million for the same periods in 2023. These\nmodifications represented 0.10percent and 0.20percent of outstanding credit card\nand other consumer loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared\nto 0.08percent and 0.15percent for the same periods in 2023. During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024, the financial effect of modifications resulted in\na weighted-average interest rate reduction of 19.59percent and 19.66percent\ncompared to 19.02percent and 18.82percent for the same periods in 2023, and\nprincipal forgiveness of $ 29million and $ 57million, compared to $ 14million and\n$ 25million for the same periods in 2023. The Corporation tracks the performance\nof modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs. As of June 30,\n2024, defaults of modified credit card and other consumer loans over the last 12\nmonths were insignificant. Defaults of modified credit card and other consumer\nloans since January 1, 2023 were insignificant during the first half of 2023. At\nJune 30, 2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $ 674million, of\nwhich $ 566million were\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America74                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncurrent, $ 58million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 50million were greater than\n90 days past due. At June 30, 2023, modified credit card and other consumer loans\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled $ 303million, of which $\n237million were current, $ 35million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 31million\nwere greater than 90 days past due. Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to\ncommercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the\nCorporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique, reflects the borrower\u2019s individual circumstances and is\ndesigned to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure.\nCommercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances.\nPayment forbearances involve the Bank forbearing its contractual right to collect\ncertain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of\ntime. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently\nfor commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with\nforeclosure, short sales or other settlement agreements, leading to termination or\nsale of the loan.

Cash used\nfor originations and purchases of LHFS\ntotaled $ 17.0billion and $ 7.3billion\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023 . Also included were non-cash\nnet transfers into LHFS of $ 0and $\n457million during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 . Accrued\nInterest Receivable Accrued interest\nreceivable for loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale was $ 4.5billion at\nboth June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nand is reported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024, the Corporation\nreversed $ 215million and $ 420million\nof interest and fee income against the\nincome statement line item in which it\nwas originally recorded upon charge-off\nof the principal balance of the loan\ncompared to $ 138million and $\n256million for the same periods in 2023.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, interest and fee income\nreversed at the time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using\nquantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as\nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an\neconomic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that\nare expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected\nin the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of\nthe assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross\ndomestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond\nspreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to\neach scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent\n\neconomic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist\nviews, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss\naccounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The June 30, 2024\nestimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios,\nincluding a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse\nscenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting\ncontinued inflation and interest rates with minimal rate cuts, a tail risk\nscenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an\nupside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline\nscenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above scenarios has\nimproved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December 31,\n2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment\nrate will be four and a half percent by the fourth quarter of 2024 and will\nincrease to just below fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2025. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes sluggish growth with U.S. real gross domestic product\nforecasted to grow at 1.0percent and 1.5percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2024 and 2025. The allowance for credit losses decreased $ 209million\nfrom December 31, 2023 to $ 14.3billion at June 30, 2024, which included a $\n33million reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio and a $ 176million\nreserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The reserve decrease was\nprimarily driven by commercial due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. The\nchange in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $\n104million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease of $\n105million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decline in the\nallowance for credit losses was attributed to decreases in the commercial\nportfolio of $ 176million and the consumer real estate portfolio of $ 66million,\npartially offset by an increase in the credit card and other consumer portfolios\nof $ 33million. The provision for credit losses increased $ 383million to $\n1.5billion, and $ 771million to $ 2.8billion for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit\nlosses for the current-year periods was primarily driven by credit card loans and\nthe commercial real estate office portfolio. Outstanding loans and leases\nexcluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $ 3.4billion\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily driven by commercial, which\nincreased $ 6.4billion due to broad-based growth. Consumer loans decreased $\n3.0billion driven by credit card loans.

    \nNOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be\n\nused to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The\nCorporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs,\ninvestment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation\u2019s\nuse of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6\n\u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The\ntables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in situations where the\nCorporation has a loan or security interest and involvement with transferred\nassets\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nor if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest in the VIE. The tables\nalso present the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated\nVIEs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that\nall of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential\nlosses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also\npotential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded\nliquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-\ndowns of assets. The Corporation invests in ABS, CLOs and other similar\ninvestments issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of\ninvolvement other than a loan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the\nCorporation also enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may\nutilize VIEs for activities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to\nhold collateral. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the\ninvestment balances. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013\nSecurities or Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit\nLosses and are not included in the following tables. The Corporation did not\nprovide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023 that it was\nnot previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The\nCorporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and\ncollateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 957million and\n$ 989million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. First-lien Mortgage\nSecuritizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation\nsecuritizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates\nor purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and\nFHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in\nconjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may\nalso securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the\nCorporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates\nor purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it\nsecuritizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity\ntranches issued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the\nsecuritization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. The\ntable below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage\nsecuritizations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  F\u2026                                                                              \n  M\u2026                                                                              \n  S\u2026                                                                              \n           R\u2026                                                                     \n           M\u2026                                    C\u2026                               \n            -                                    M\u2026                               \n           A\u2026                                                                     \n           T\u2026                 S\u2026                 T\u2026                 S\u2026            \n           M\u2026                 M\u2026                 M\u2026                 M\u2026            \n           E\u2026                 E\u2026                 E\u2026                 E\u2026            \n           J\u2026                 J\u2026                 J\u2026                 J\u2026            \n           30                 30                 30                 30            \n  (\u2026                                                                              \n  in       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                                                              \n  P\u2026                                                                              \n  f\u2026    $  9\u2026    $  908    $  2\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  5\u2026    $  455    $  7\u2026    $  597  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  G\u2026                                                                              \n  (\u2026       -2         1       -2        -4       69        -1       88         2  \n  on                                                                              \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  R\u2026                                                                              \n  f\u2026        8         5       16        14        \u2014         \u2014        \u2014         \u2014  \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  t\u2026                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations\nsponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and\nprimarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 8million and $\n13million, net of hedges, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024\ncompared to $ 7million and $ 17million for the same periods in 2023, are not\nincluded in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n88.2billion and $ 95.9billion at June 30, 2024 and 2023. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 58million and $ 120million during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $ 63million and $ 132million\nfor the same periods in 2023. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including\nloans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $ 1.1billion and $\n1.3billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For more information on MSRs,\nsee Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . Home Equity Loans The Corporation retains\ninterests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to\nwhich it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be\nobligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization\nevent. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding\ntable. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of\ncredit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of\nrelated cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential\nmortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $ 32million and $ 825million\ncompared to $ 296million and $ 624million for the same periods in 2023. The\nfollowing table summarizes select information related to mortgage and home equity\nsecuritization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest and had\ncontinuing involvement at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                         \u2026                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026                               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n         \u2014       \u2014       2       4       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       6       7                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       1       1                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2014    $  7    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n(1) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and\nother arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations, but excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and\nother servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies and Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(2) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the\ntransferor to securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which\nmay include servicing the loans.\n\n(3) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes\noutstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Credit Card and\nAutomobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and\npurchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are\nsold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are\nongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either\nloan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on\nthe securitization structure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various\nsubordinated interests, including an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit\ncard receivables and owning certain retained interests. At June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $\n18.7billion and $ 16.6billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the\ncarrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party\ninvestors from the trusts totaled $ 8.6billion and $ 7.8billion, which are\nincluded in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation\nresecuritized $ 3.8billion and $ 6.6billion of securities during the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 compared to $ 4.1billion and $ 5.8billion for the same\nperiods in 2023. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured\nat fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar\nactivities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale\nwas recorded. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n795million and $ 883million, compared to $ 478million and $ 1.1billion for the\nsame periods in 2023, of which substantially all of the securities were classified\nas trading account assets for both periods. Substantially all of the trading\naccount securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the\nfair value hierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-\nlinked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition\nVIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market\nor credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial\ninstrument. The Corporation\u2019s involvement in the VIE is limited to its loss\nexposure.

or practice to sell or repledge. At June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of this collateral was $ 975.8billion and $\n911.3billion, of which $ 934.1billion and $ 870.9billion were sold or repledged.\nThe primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation held\nrestricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 5.4billion and $ 5.6billion, predominantly related to cash\nsegregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet reserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCredit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to extend\ncredit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial\nletters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following\ntable includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments\nnet of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts were $ 10.3billion at both June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s credit extension\ncommitments at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, excluding commitments\naccounted for under the fair value option, was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.2billion,\nwhich predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to\nextend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s ability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of commitments of $ 3.2billion and $ 2.6billion at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that are accounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 73million and $ 67million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nwhich is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more\ninformation regarding the Corporation\u2019s loan commitments accounted for under the\nfair value option, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value Option.\n

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 23.4billion and $\n9.8billion at June 30, 2024, and $ 23.6billion and $ 9.7billion at December 31,\n2023. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 864million and $ 744million\nat June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 540million and $ 822million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 1.3billion and $ 420million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\nhad commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities\nborrowing agreements of $ 126.3billion and $ 117.0billion, and commitments to\nenter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $\n94.3billion and $ 63.0billion. A significant portion of these commitments will\nexpire within the next 12months. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 4.0billion on a\nrolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This\ncommitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior\nnotice. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had unfunded\nequity investment commitments of $ 478million and $ 477million. As a Federal\nReserve member bank, the Corporation is required to subscribe to a certain amount\nof shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays cumulative\ndividends at a prescribed rate. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had paid $ 5.4billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the\nremaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district bank board, which\nthe Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance\nBook Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nnotional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.3billion and $ 3.8billion. At June\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to\nthese guarantees totaled $ 508million and $ 577million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2034 and 2037. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable\nfor any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among\nother things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after\na purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The\nability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 225billion, is an estimate\nof the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of June 30, 2024. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a\ncardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation\nmitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or\nother types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for\ncontingent losses, and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing\nactivity were not significant.\n                                                                                  \n  85Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nRepresentations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees For\nmore information on representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 265million and $\n604million at June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 and is included in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and the\nrelated provision is included in other\nincome in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. The representations and\nwarranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of incurred\nlosses, is based on its experience in\nprevious negotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 131.7billion and $ 132.5billion at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory\ntrust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the\nCorporation. Other Contingencies In\n2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) issued a final rule\nto impose a special assessment to\nrecover\n\ncertain estimated losses to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (DIF) arising from the\nclosures of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank. The estimated losses\nwill be recovered through quarterly\nspecial assessments collected from\ncertain insured depository institutions,\nincluding the Corporation, and\ncollection began during the three months\nended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s\naccrual for its estimated share of the\nFDIC special assessment was $ 2.5billion\nand $ 2.1billion. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the FDIC\u2019s\nestimated loss to the DIF, which could\naffect the amount of its accrued\nliability.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure and updated\nbelow, whether a loss in excess of any\naccrued liability is reasonably possible\nin future periods. Once the loss\ncontingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n53million and $ 151million was\nrecognized for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to $\n276million and $ 365million for the same\nperiods in 2023. For any matter\ndisclosed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure for which a\nloss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n0.8billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of June 30, 2024.\nThe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are based upon\ncurrently available information and\nsubject to significant judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The matters\nunderlying the accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure regarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America86                                                               \n                                                                                  \nliabilities, management does not believe\nthat loss contingencies arising from\npending matters, including the matters\ndescribed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure and updated\nbelow, will have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the\nsignificant judgment, variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties involved\nin those matters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and\nthe very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Deposit Insurance\nAssessment On July 1, 2024, the district\ncourt judge vacated the magistrate\njudge\u2019s April 2023 report and\nrecommendation for resolving the\nparties\u2019 cross-motions for summary\njudgment, and asked the parties to file\nnew motions, in light of a recent\nSupreme Court decision, by the end of\nOctober 2024.

exit\nprice) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The\nCorporation determines the fair values of its financial\n\ninstruments under applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of\nfair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in\nthe financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, there were no changes to valuation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations. For more\ninformation regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair\nvalue and valuation techniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nNote 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
