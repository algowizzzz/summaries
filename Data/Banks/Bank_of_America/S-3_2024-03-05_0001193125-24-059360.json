We will describe\nin the applicable supplement any specific terms of the depositary shares. We\nwill issue the depositary shares under deposit agreements that we will enter\ninto with one or more depositories. Form of Securities Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue the securities in book-\nentry only form through one or more depositories, such as The Depository Trust\nCompany, Euroclear Bank SA/NV, Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg, or CDS\nClearing and Depository Services Inc., as identified in the applicable\nsupplement. We will issue the securities only in registered form, without\ncoupons, although we may issue the securities in bearer form if we so specify in\nthe applicable supplement. The securities issued in book-entry only form will be\nuncertificated or will be represented by a global security registered in the\nname of the specified depository or its nominee (unless otherwise specified in\nthe applicable supplement), rather than certificated securities in definitive\nform registered in the name of each individual owner. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, each sale of securities in book-entry\nonly form will settle in immediately available funds through the specified\ndepository. A global security may be exchanged for certificated securities in\ndefinitive form registered in the names of the beneficial owners only under the\nlimited circumstances described in this prospectus. Payment Currencies All\namounts payable in respect of the securities, including the purchase price, will\nbe payable in U.S. dollars, unless we specify another currency for payment of\nsuch amounts in the applicable supplement.\n\n6\n\nListing We will state in the applicable supplement whether the particular\nsecurities that we are offering will be listed or quoted on a securities\nexchange or quotation system. Distribution We may offer the securities using\nthis prospectus:\n                             \n      through underwriters;  \n                             \n                        \n      through dealers;  \n                        \n                          \n      through agents;\u00a0or  \n                          \n                               \n      directly to purchasers.  \n                               \nThe applicable supplement will include any required information about the firms\nwe use and the discounts or commissions we may pay them for their services.

Market-Making by Our Affiliates Following\nthe initial distribution of an offering of securities, BofA Securities, Inc.,\nand other broker-dealer affiliates of ours, may offer and sell those securities\nin the course of their businesses as broker-dealers. BofA Securities, Inc. and\nany such other broker-dealer affiliates may act as a principal or agent in these\ntransactions.

This summary does not describe all\nof the risks and investment considerations with respect to an investment in our\nsecurities, including risks and considerations relating to a prospective\ninvestor\u0092s particular circumstances. For information regarding risks and\nuncertainties that may materially affect our business and results, please refer\nto the information under the caption \u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in our annual\nreport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated\nby reference in this prospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties\ndiscussed in our subsequent filings that are incorporated by reference in this\nprospectus. You also should review the risk factors that will be set forth in\nany applicable supplement for a particular offering of securities. Prospective\ninvestors should consult their own financial, legal, tax, and other professional\nadvisors as to the risks associated with an investment in our securities and the\nsuitability of the investment for the investor.\n\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Resolution Strategies and Long-Term Debt\nRequirements\n\nA resolution under our single point of entry resolution strategy could\nmaterially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our\nability to pay our obligations on our securities.\n\nWe are\nrequired periodically to submit a plan to the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u0093Federal Reserve\u0094) describing our resolution strategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. Our\npreferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry (\u0093SPOE\u0094) strategy,\nwhereby only Bank of America (the parent holding company) would file for\nbankruptcy\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain key operating subsidiaries would be\nprovided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress\nand to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a\nsolvent manner\nfollowing a Bank of America bankruptcy. We have entered into intercompany\narrangements governing the contribution of most of our capital and liquidity to\nthese key subsidiaries. As part of these arrangements, we have transferred most\nof our assets\n(and have agreed to transfer additional assets) to a wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary in exchange for a subordinated note. Certain of our remaining\nassets secure our ongoing obligations under these intercompany arrangements. The\nwholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary also has provided us with a committed line of credit\nthat, in addition to our cash, dividends and interest payments, including\ninterest payments we receive in respect of the subordinated note, may be used to\nfund our\nobligations. These intercompany arrangements include provisions to terminate the\nline of credit and forgive the subordinated note and require us to contribute\nour remaining financial assets to the wholly-owned holding company subsidiary if\nour\nprojected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that our resolution\nbecomes imminent, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to meet\nour obligations on our securities. In addition, our preferred resolution\nstrategy could result\nin holders of our securities being in a worse position and suffering greater\nlosses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or other\nresolution scenarios or plans.\n\nUnder Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nof 2010 (the \u0093Financial Reform Act\u0094), when a global\nsystemically important banking organization (\u0093G-SIB\u0094), such as Bank of America,\nis in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver to\nconduct an orderly liquidation and could,\namong other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury makes\ncertain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. Additionally, the\nFDIC could\nreplace Bank of America with a bridge holding company, which could continue\noperations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose\nequity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC\u0092s \u0093single\npoint of entry\u0094 strategy may result in\n\n8\n\nholders of our securities suffering greater losses than would have been the case\nunder a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy. If Bank of\nAmerica is resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or the FDIC\u0092s orderly liquidation authority, third-party\ncreditors of our subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on\ntheir claims, while holders of Bank of America\u0092s securities could face\nsignificant or\ncomplete losses.\n\nIf we enter a resolution proceeding, holders of our debt securities and equity\nsecurities would be at risk of absorbing our losses.\n\nIf we enter a resolution proceeding under either the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or\nTitle II of the Financial Reform\nAct, our losses would be imposed first on holders of our equity securities and\nthereafter on holders of our unsecured debt, including our debt securities, and\nsome or all of such securities could be significantly reduced or eliminated as a\nresult of\nsuch resolution proceeding.\n\nUnder our SPOE resolution strategy, and the single point of entry strategy\npreferred by the FDIC under Title\nII of the Financial Reform Act, the value that would be distributed to holders\nof our unsecured debt, including our debt securities, may not be sufficient to\nrepay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt, and holders\nof such\ndebt could receive no consideration at all under these resolution scenarios.\nEither of these resolution strategies could result in holders of our debt\nsecurities being in a worse position and suffering greater losses than would\nhave been the case\nunder a different resolution strategy. Although SPOE is our preferred resolution\nstrategy, neither Bank of America nor a bankruptcy court would be obligated to\nfollow our SPOE strategy. Additionally, the FDIC is not obligated to follow its\nSPOE\nstrategy to resolve Bank of America under Title II of the Financial Reform Act.\nFor more information regarding the financial consequences of any such resolution\nproceeding, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Financial Consequences to\nUnsecured Debtholders of Single Point of Entry Resolution Strategy\u0094 below.\n\nWe are subject to the Federal Reserve\u0092s final rules requiring U.S. G-SIBsto\nmaintain minimum amounts of long-term debt meeting specified eligibility\nrequirements.\n\nUnder the rules of the Federal Reserve relating to total loss-absorbing capacity\n(the \u0093TLAC Rules\u0094), we, as a U.S. G-SIB, are required to, among other things,\nmaintain minimum amounts of unsecured external long-term debt satisfying certain\neligibility criteria (\u0093eligible LTD\u0094) and other loss-absorbing capacity for the\npurpose of absorbing our losses in a resolution proceeding under either the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or Title II of the Financial Reform Act. Any senior long-term\ndebt must include terms required by the TLAC Rules in order to qualify as\neligible LTD.\nActions required to comply with the TLAC Rules could impact our funding and\nliquidity risk management plans.\n\nRisks Relating to Debt Securities Generally\n\nOur obligations on the debt securities will be structurally subordinated to\nliabilities of our subsidiaries.\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to participate in any distribution\nof assets of any subsidiary upon such\nsubsidiary\u0092s liquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior\nclaims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent we may ourselves be\nrecognized as a creditor of that subsidiary. As a result, our obligations under\nthe\ndebt securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future\nliabilities of our subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to our assets\nfor payments. Further, creditors of subsidiaries recapitalized pursuant to our\nresolution plan\ngenerally would be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of the\nsubsidiaries, including our contributed assets. In addition, our debt securities\nwill be unsecured and, therefore, in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, will\neffectively\nrank junior to our secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets\nsecuring such obligations.\n\n9\n\nHolders of our debt securities could be at greater risk for being structurally\nsubordinated if we sell or convey all or substantially all of our assets to one\nor more of our majority-owned subsidiaries. We may sell, convey or transfer all\nor substantially all of our assets to one or more entities that are direct or\nindirect majority-owned subsidiaries of ours in which we or one or more of our\nsubsidiaries owns more than 50% of the combined voting power, and under the\nindentures under which the debt securities will be issued, such subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries will not be required to assume our obligations under such debt\nsecurities, and we will remain the sole obligor on such debt securities. In such\nevent, creditors of any such subsidiary or subsidiaries would have additional\nassets from which to recover on their claims while holders of our debt\nsecurities would be structurally subordinated to creditors of such subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries with respect to such transferred assets. See \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets\u0094 below for more\ninformation. Events for which acceleration rights under our senior debt\nsecurities may be exercised are more limited than those available pursuant to\nthe terms of our outstanding senior debt securities issued prior to January 13,\n2017. In response to the TLAC Rules, on January 13, 2017, we modified the terms\nof our senior debt securities to be issued on or after that date to, among other\nthings, limit the circumstances under which the payment of the principal amount\nof such senior debt securities can be accelerated (unless specified otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement). All or substantially all of our outstanding senior\ndebt securities issued prior to January 13, 2017 (the \u0093Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities\u0094) provide acceleration rights for nonpayment or bankruptcy. The\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities also provide acceleration rights if we default in\nthe performance of our covenants in those debt securities or the applicable\nindenture under which those securities were issued. In addition, the\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities do not require a 30-daycure period before a\nnonpayment of principal becomes an event of default and acceleration rights\nbecome exercisable with respect to such nonpayment. However, under the Senior\nIndenture (as defined below), unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, payment of the principal amount of our senior debt securities issued\nunder such indenture:\n                                                                                  \n      may be accelerated only (i)\u00a0if we default in the payment of the principal   \n      of or interest on those senior                                              \n      debt securities and, in each case, the default continues for a period of    \n      30 days, or (ii)\u00a0upon our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy and, in the   \n      case of our involuntary bankruptcy, the event continues for a period of 60  \n      days; and                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      may not be accelerated if we default in the performance of any other        \n      covenants contained in such senior debt                                     \n      securities or the Senior Indenture.                                         \n                                                                                  \nAs a result of these differing provisions, if we breach or otherwise default in\nthe performance of a covenant (other than a payment covenant) that applies both to\nsenior debt securities that we issued on or after January 13, 2017 and the\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities, the Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities would have\nacceleration rights that would not be available to the holders of our other senior\ndebt securities. In addition, if we fail to pay principal when due with respect to\nour senior debt securities issued on or after on or after January 13, 2017 and the\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities, an event of default would occur immediately with\nrespect to the Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities (and the exercise of acceleration\nrights could proceed immediately in accordance with the 10\n\nprovisions of the indenture under which those debt securities were issued), while\nthe holders of our other senior debt securities must wait for the 30-daycure\nperiod to expire before such nonpayment of principal becomes an event of default\nand any acceleration rights are triggered with respect to such nonpayment. Any\nrepayment of the principal amount of Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities following the\nexercise of acceleration rights in circumstances in which such rights are not\navailable to the holders of our other senior debt securities (including our debt\nsecurities offered by this prospectus) could adversely affect our ability to make\ntimely payments on such other senior debt securities thereafter. The market value\nof the debt securities may be less than the principal amount of the debt\nsecurities. The market for, and market value of, the debt securities may be\naffected by a number of factors. These factors include:\n                                                                                  \n      the method of calculating the principal of or any premium, interest or      \n      other amounts payable on the debt                                           \n      securities;                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                              \n      the time remaining to maturity of the debt securities;  \n                                                              \n                                                                         \n      the aggregate amount outstanding of the relevant debt securities;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                    \n      any redemption or repayment features of the debt securities;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                \n      the level, direction, and volatility of market interest rates generally;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n      general economic conditions of the capital markets in the United States;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n      geopolitical conditions and other financial, political, regulatory and      \n      judicial events that affect the financial                                   \n      markets generally; and                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      any market-making activities with respect to the debt securities.  \n                                                                         \nOften, the only way to liquidate your investment in the debt securities prior to\nmaturity will be to sell the debt securities. At that time, there may be a very\nilliquid market for the debt securities or no market at all. If you sell your debt\nsecurities prior to maturity, you may receive less than the principal amount of\nsuch debt securities. Acceleration rights for our subordinated debt securities are\navailable only in limited circumstances. The rights of acceleration under our\nsubordinated debt securities are more limited than those available pursuant to the\nterms of our senior debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the payment of principal of our subordinated debt securities may be\naccelerated only in the event of our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy under\nU.S. federal bankruptcy laws (and, in the case of our involuntary bankruptcy, such\nevent continues for a period of 60 days). If you purchase any subordinated debt\nsecurities, you will have no right to accelerate the payment of principal of the\nsubordinated debt securities if we fail to pay principal or interest when due on\nthose subordinated debt securities or if we fail in the performance of any of our\nother obligations under those subordinated debt securities. 11\n\nOur obligations under subordinated debt securities will be subordinated.\n\nHolders of our subordinated debt securities should recognize that contractual\nprovisions in the Subordinated Indenture (as defined below) may\nprohibit us from making payments on the subordinated debt securities. The\nsubordinated debt securities are unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of\npayment to all of our senior indebtedness (as defined in the Subordinated\nIndenture), to the\nextent and in the manner provided in the Subordinated Indenture. In addition, the\nsubordinated debt securities may be fully subordinated to interests held by the\nU.S. government in the event we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation\nor\nsimilar proceedings, including a proceeding under Title II of the Financial Reform\nAct. For additional information regarding the subordination provisions applicable\nto the subordinated debt securities, see \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Subordination\u0094 below.\n\nRedemption of our debt securities prior to maturity may result in a reduced return\non your investment.\n\nThe terms of our debt securities may permit or require redemption of the debt\nsecurities prior to maturity. That\nredemption may occur at a time when prevailing interest rates are relatively low.\nAs a result, a holder of the redeemed debt securities may not be able to invest\nthe redemption proceeds in a new investment that yields a similar return.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\n\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock may be\nlimited by regulatory policies and requirements.\n\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital\nactions, including payment of dividends. For instance,\nFederal Reserve regulations require major U.S. bank holding companies to submit a\ncapital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(\u0093CCAR\u0094). Our ability to pay dividends depends in part on our ability to maintain\nregulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers. To the extent\nthat the Federal Reserve increases our stress capital buffer (\u0093SCB\u0094), G-SIB\nsurcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our ability to pay or increase\ndividends could be limited. As part of its annual CCAR, we are subject to\nextensive regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices by the Federal\nReserve, including stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical\neconomic scenarios\nprepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test\nresults, which may impact our SCB level, requiring us to hold additional capital\nor causing changes in required capital buffers. Additionally, the Federal Reserve\nmay\nimpose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or\nincreasing common stock dividends. If the Federal Reserve finds that any of our\nU.S. bank subsidiaries are not \u0093well-capitalized\u0094 or \u0093well-managed,\u0094\nwe would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply\nwith all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain\nadditional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the\napplicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain\ncircumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding\ncompany, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and\nto\nprohibit payment thereof.\n\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\n\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our\nboard of directors may declare out of funds legally available\nfor such payments. Furthermore, holders of our common stock are subject to the\nprior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or the depositary shares\nrepresenting such preferred stock then outstanding. Although we have historically\ndeclared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may\nreduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\n\n12\n\nOur common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future\nindebtedness and preferred stock.\n\nShares of our common stock are equity interests in us and do not constitute\nindebtedness. This means that shares of\nour common stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-\nequity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us,\nincluding claims in our liquidation. Additionally,\nholders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation\nrights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock or depositary shares\nrepresenting interests in such preferred stock then outstanding. Our board of\ndirectors is\nauthorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any\naction on the part of the holders of our common stock. As of March 5, 2024, the\naggregate liquidation preference of all our outstanding preferred stock was\napproximately $28.7 billion.\n\nOur preferred stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future\nindebtedness.\n\nShares of our preferred stock are equity interests in us and do not constitute\nindebtedness. This means that shares of our preferred stock and\nany depositary shares which represent interests in shares of our preferred stock\nwill rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims against\nus and our assets available to satisfy claims\nagainst us, including claims in our liquidation. Our existing and future\nindebtedness may restrict payment of dividends on our preferred stock. In\naddition, holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing\ninterests in shares of our\npreferred stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government\nin the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or\nsimilar proceeding.\n\nCash dividends on our preferred stock are subject to certain limitations.\n\nUnlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on\nspecified due dates, in the case of our preferred stock\n(1) dividends are payable only when, as and if declared by our board of directors\nor a duly authorized committee of our board of directors and (2) as a corporation,\nwe are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments on\nour preferred stock out of legally available funds. In addition, under the Federal\nReserve\u0092s risk-based capital rules related to additional Tier 1 capital\ninstruments, dividends on our preferred stock may only be paid out of our net\nincome,\nretained earnings or surplus related to other additional Tier 1 capital\ninstruments.\n\nIf we are deferring payments on our outstanding junior subordinated notes or are\nin default under the indentures governing those securities, we will be prohibited\nfrom making distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, or redeeming\nour preferred stock.\n\nThe terms of our currently outstanding junior subordinated notes prohibit us from\ndeclaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our\ncommon stock and preferred stock, or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making a\nliquidation payment on such stock, if we are aware of any event that would be an\nevent of default under the indenture governing those junior subordinated notes or\nat\nany time when we have deferred payment of interest on those junior subordinated\nnotes.\n\n13\n\nOther Risks\n\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock and to make\npayments on our debt securities depends upon our receipt of funds from our\nsubsidiaries and applicable laws and regulations, and actions we have taken\npursuant to our resolution plan, could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds to us.\n\nWe are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through\nour subsidiaries. We depend on dividends and other\ndistributions, loans and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund dividend\npayments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund payments on our other\nobligations, including the debt securities. Any inability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds, pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash\nflow, liquidity and financial condition. Many of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from\nthose subsidiaries to us or to our other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates, minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements\nand restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or\nbrokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Lower earnings in our subsidiaries\ncan reduce\nthe amount of funds available to us. Adverse business and economic conditions,\nincluding changes in interest and currency exchange rates, illiquidity or\nvolatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk, and a failure in or\nbreach of our\noperational or security systems or infrastructure, could affect our businesses and\nresults of operations. Intercompany arrangements we have entered into in\nconnection with our resolution planning could restrict the amount of funding\navailable to us\nfrom our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097A resolution under our single point of entry resolution strategy could\nmaterially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our ability\nto\npay our obligations on our securities.\u0094 These restrictions could prevent those\nsubsidiaries from paying dividends or making other distributions to us or\notherwise providing funds to us that we need in order to pay dividends or make\npayments on\nour securities. Also, our right to participate in any distribution of assets of\nany of our subsidiaries upon such subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or otherwise will be\nsubject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent\nthat any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\n\nWe cannot assure you that a trading market for your securities will ever develop\nor be maintained.\n\nWe may not list our securities on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how\nthese\nsecurities will trade in the secondary market or whether that market will be\nliquid or illiquid. The number of potential buyers of our securities in any\nsecondary market may be limited. Although any underwriters or agents may purchase\nand sell our\nsecurities in the secondary market from time to time, these underwriters or agents\nwill not be obligated to do so and may discontinue making a market for the\nsecurities at any time without giving us notice. We cannot assure you that a\nsecondary\nmarket for any of our securities will develop, or that if one develops, it will be\nmaintained.\n\nOur trading activities may create conflicts of interest with you.\n\nWe or one or more of our broker-dealer affiliates, including BofA Securities,\nInc., may engage in\ntrading activities that are not for your account or on your behalf. These trading\nactivities may present a conflict of interest between the interest of holders of\nthe securities and the interests we and our affiliates may have in our proprietary\naccounts, in facilitating transactions, including block\n\n14\n\ntrades, for our other customers, and in accounts under our management. These\ntrading activities could influence secondary trading (if any) in the securities,\nor otherwise could be adverse to the\ninterests of a beneficial owner of the securities.\n\nPayments on the securities are subject to our credit risk, and actual or perceived\nchanges in our creditworthiness may affect the value of our securities.\n\nOur credit ratings are an assessment of our ability to pay our\nobligations. Consequently, our perceived creditworthiness and actual or\nanticipated changes in our credit ratings may affect the market value of our\nsecurities. However, because the return on our securities generally depends upon\nfactors in addition\nto our ability to pay our obligations, an improvement in our credit ratings will\nnot reduce the other investment risks, if any, related to our securities.\n\n15\n\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION Bank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation,\na bank holding company, and a financial holding company. Through various bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries throughout the United States and in international markets, we\nprovide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and\nproducts.

These additional\nfinancings may include the sale of other securities. 16\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nGeneral\n\nWe\nmay issue senior or subordinated debt securities. Neither the senior debt\nsecurities nor the subordinated debt securities will be secured by any of our\nproperty or assets. As a result, by owning a debt security, you are one of our\nunsecured\ncreditors.\n\nThe senior debt securities will constitute part of our senior debt, will be issued\nunder our Senior Indenture described below,\nand will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding, except obligations that are\nsubject to any priorities or preferences by law.\n\nThe subordinated debt securities will constitute part of our subordinated debt,\nwill be issued under our Subordinated Indenture described\nbelow, and will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to all of our\n\u0093senior indebtedness,\u0094 as defined in the Subordinated Indenture, from time to time\noutstanding to the extent and in the manner provided in the Subordinated\nIndenture. The subordinated debt securities will rank equally in right of payment\nwith all our other unsecured and subordinated indebtedness, other than unsecured\nand subordinated indebtedness that by its terms is subordinated to the\nsubordinated\ndebt securities. Neither the Senior Indenture nor the Subordinated Indenture\nlimits our ability to incur additional \u0093senior indebtedness.\u0094\n\nThis section of the prospectus provides a summary of the material terms of the\nSenior Indenture and the Subordinated Indenture and certain\nspecific terms of debt securities that may be applicable if so specified in the\napplicable supplement for such debt securities.\n\nFinancial Consequences to Unsecured Debtholders of Single Point of Entry\nResolution Strategy\n\nWe are subject to the TLAC Rules, which aim to improve the resiliency and\nresolvability of U.S. global systemically important bank holding\ncompanies (\u0093covered BHCs\u0094), including Bank of America, in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. The TLAC Rules include the requirement that each\ncovered BHC maintain a minimum amount of eligible LTD and other loss-absorbing\ncapacity. The eligible LTD would absorb the covered BHC\u0092s losses, following the\ndepletion of its equity, upon its entry into a resolution proceeding under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or a resolution proceeding administered by the FDIC under\nTitle\nII of the Financial Reform Act.\n\nUnder Title I of the Financial Reform Act, we are required by the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC to\nperiodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. Our\npreferred resolution strategy under this plan is a SPOE strategy, whereby only\nBank of America\nwould file for bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under this strategy, and\npursuant to existing intercompany arrangements under which we have transferred\nmost of our assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, which holds the\nequity\ninterests in our key operating subsidiaries, we would contribute our remaining\nfinancial assets, less a holdback to cover our bankruptcy expenses, to this\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary prior to filing for bankruptcy. We would\nthen file for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to an order from\nthe bankruptcy court under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we, as\ndebtor-in-possession, would transfer our subsidiaries to a newly-formed entity\n(\u0093NewCo\u0094) that would be held in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of our\nbankruptcy estate.\n\n17\n\nUnder our SPOE resolution strategy, the obligations of Bank of America on its\nunsecured debt, including the debt securities offered pursuant to this prospectus,\nwould not be assumed by NewCo; instead, the claims on such obligations would be\nleft behind in the bankruptcy proceeding. After the transferred subsidiaries were\nstabilized, NewCo\u0092s residual value in the form of shares or proceeds from the sale\nof shares would be distributed to the holders of claims against the bankruptcy\nestate in accordance with the priority of their claims, including to holders of\nour debt securities. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its similar\npreferred SPOE recapitalization model for resolving a global systemically\nimportant banking group, such as Bank of America, under Title II of the Financial\nReform Act. Under Title II, when a covered BHC is in default or danger of default,\nthe FDIC may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation of such\ninstitution as an alternative to resolution of the entity under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress\nand systemic risk determinations. Pursuant to the single point of entry\nrecapitalization model, the FDIC would use its power to create a \u0093bridge entity\u0094\nfor the covered BHC; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the\ncovered BHC\u0092s business to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries using\nassets of the covered BHC that have been transferred to the bridge entity; and\nexchange external debt claims against the covered BHC, including claims of holders\nof our debt securities and other unsecured debt, for equity in the bridge entity.\nThis strategy would allow operating subsidiaries of the covered BHC to continue to\noperate and impose losses on stockholders and creditors of the covered BHC, which\ncould include holders of our debt securities. The Indentures The senior debt\nsecurities and the subordinated debt securities each are governed by a document\ncalled an indenture, which is a contract between us and the applicable trustee.\nSenior debt securities will be issued under the Indenture for Senior Debt\nSecurities dated as of June 27, 2018 (as supplemented from time to time, the\n\u0093Senior Indenture\u0094) between us, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A., as trustee, and subordinated debt securities will be issued under\nthe Indenture for Subordinated Debt Securities dated as of June 27, 2018 (as\nsupplemented from time to time, the \u0093Subordinated Indenture\u0094) between us, as\nissuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. These\nindentures are substantially identical in all material respects, except for:\n                                                                                  \n      the covenant described below under \u0093\u0097Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of     \n      Principal Subsidiary                                                        \n      Bank,\u0094 which is included only in the Senior Indenture;                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the provisions relating to subordination described below under              \n      \u0093\u0097Subordination,\u0094 which are                                                    \n      included only in the Subordinated Indenture;\u00a0and                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the events of default relating to payment defaults and specific provisions  \n      for covenant breaches, as described                                         \n      below under \u0093\u0097Events of Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant          \n      Breaches,\u0094 which are not included in the Subordinated Indenture.             \n                                                                                  \nIn this prospectus, when we refer to \u0093debt securities,\u0094 we mean both our senior\ndebt securities and our subordinated debt securities. When we refer to the\n\u0093indenture\u0094 or the \u0093trustee\u0094 with respect to any debt securities, we mean the\nindenture under which those debt securities are issued and the trustee under that\nindenture, and when we refer to the \u0093indentures,\u0094 we mean both the Senior\nIndenture and the Subordinated Indenture, together. The trustee under each\nindenture has two principal functions:\n                                                                                  \n      First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default.        \n      However, there are limitations on the extent                                \n      to which the trustee may act on your behalf, which we describe below under  \n      \u0093\u0097Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.\u0094            \n                                                                                  \n18\n                                                                                  \n      Second, the trustee performs administrative duties for us, including the    \n      delivery of interest and other payments                                     \n      and notices.                                                                \n                                                                                  \nNeither of the indentures limit the aggregate amount of debt securities that we\nmay issue or the number of series or the aggregate amount of any particular series\nof debt securities. The indentures and the debt securities also do not limit our\nability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other securities. This means that\nwe may issue additional debt securities and other securities at any time without\nyour consent and without notifying you. In addition, neither of the indentures\ncontain provisions protecting holders against a decline in our credit quality\nresulting from takeovers, recapitalizations, the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, or restructuring. If our credit quality declines as a result of an\nevent of this type, or otherwise, any ratings of our debt securities then\noutstanding may be withdrawn or downgraded. This section is a summary of the\nmaterial terms and provisions of the indentures. We have filed the indentures with\nthe SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a\npart. See \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094 below for information on how to\nobtain copies of the indentures. Whenever we refer to the defined terms of an\nindenture in this section of this prospectus or in a supplement hereto without\ndefining them, the terms have the meanings given to them in that indenture. You\nmust look to the indentures for the most complete description of the information\nsummarized in this prospectus. Form and Denomination of Debt Securities Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each debt security\nin book-entry only form. Debt securities in book-entry only form will be\nrepresented by a global security registered in the name of a depository or its\nnominee. Accordingly, the depository or its nominee will be the registered holder\nof all the debt securities represented by the global security. Those who own\nbeneficial interests in a global security will do so through participants in the\ndepository\u0092s securities clearing system, and the rights of these indirect owners\nwill be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depository and its\nparticipants. We describe the procedures applicable to book-entry only securities\nbelow under the heading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, we will issue our debt securities in fully\nregistered form, without coupons. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we\nwill describe the special considerations applicable to bearer securities in the\napplicable supplement. Some of the features that we describe in this prospectus\nmay not apply to bearer securities. Our debt securities may be denominated in U.S.\ndollars or in another currency as may be specified in the applicable supplement.\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the debt securities will\nbe denominated in U.S. dollars, and unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the debt securities will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000\nand integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $1,000. Payment for Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Debt Securities For any debt securities denominated or payable in a\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars (referred to as \u0093non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities\u0094), the initial investors will be required to pay for the debt\nsecurities in that foreign currency. The applicable selling agent may arrange for\nthe conversion of U.S. dollars into the applicable foreign currency to facilitate\npayment for the non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities by U.S. purchasers\ndesiring to make the initial payment in U.S. dollars. Any such conversion will be\nmade by that selling agent on the terms and subject to the conditions,\nlimitations, and charges as it may establish from time to time in accordance with\nits 19\n\nregular foreign exchange procedures, and subject to U.S. laws and regulations. All\ncosts of any such conversion for the initial purchase of the non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities will be borne by the initial investors using those\nconversion arrangements. Different Series of Debt Securities We may issue our debt\nsecurities from time to time in one or more series with the same or different\nmaturities. We also may \u0093reopen\u0094 a series of our debt securities. This means that\nwe can increase the principal amount of a series of our debt securities by selling\nadditional debt securities with the same terms. Such additional debt securities\nmay be issued in one or more series and with the same or different CUSIP or other\nidentifying number as the outstanding debt securities. Any such additional debt\nsecurities, together with the outstanding debt securities, will constitute a\nsingle series of debt securities under the Indenture, provided that such\nadditional debt securities will be issued with the same CUSIP or the same other\nidentifying number as the outstanding debt securities only if they are fungible\nwith the outstanding debt securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We may\ndo so without notice to the existing holders of debt securities of that series.\nHowever, any new debt securities of this kind may have a different offering price\nand may begin to bear interest (if any) at a different date. This section of the\nprospectus summarizes the material terms of the debt securities that are common to\nall series under the respective indentures. We will describe the financial and\nother specific terms of the series of debt securities being offered in the\napplicable supplement. The applicable supplement also may describe any differences\nfrom the material terms described in this prospectus. If there are any differences\nbetween the applicable supplement and this prospectus, the applicable supplement\nwill control. The terms of your series of debt securities as described in the\napplicable supplement may include the following:\n                                                  \n      the title and type of the debt securities;

We refer to these debt securities as \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 We also may issue fixed-rate notes that combine principal and interest\npayments in installment payments over the life of the notes which we refer to as\n\u0093amortizing notes.\u0094 We will make payments on fixed-rate notes as described below\nunder the heading \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0094 and\nin the applicable supplement. Floating-Rate Notes We may issue debt securities\nthat will bear interest at a floating rate of interest determined by reference to\none or more interest rate bases, referred to as the \u0093base rate.\u0094 We refer to these\ndebt securities as \u0093floating-rate notes.\u0094 The base rate for a series of floating-\nrate notes will be specified in, and will be determined in accordance with the\nspecific formula and/or applicable terms and provisions set forth in, the\napplicable supplement. Fixed/Floating Rate Notes We may issue a debt security with\nelements of each of the fixed-rate and floating-rate notes described above. For\nexample, a debt security may bear interest at a fixed rate for some interest\nperiods and at a floating rate in other interest periods. We refer to these debt\nsecurities as \u0093fixed/floating rate notes.\u0094 We will describe the determination of\ninterest or other amounts payable for any of these debt securities in the\napplicable supplement. 21\n\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes\n\nWe may issue debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate for a specified\nportion of their term and then reset that fixed rate at\nspecified intervals for the remainder of their term. We refer to these debt\nsecurities as \u0093fixed-rate reset notes.\u0094 The rate of interest on such debt\nsecurities will be specified in, and will be determined in accordance with the\nterms and\nprovisions set forth in, the applicable supplement.\n\nCalculation Agents for Certain Types of Debt Securities\n\nFor any (a) floating-rate notes, (b) fixed/floating rate notes, during any\nfloating-rate period, or (c) fixed-rate reset notes,\ncalculations will be made by the applicable calculation agent, which will be an\ninstitution that we appoint as our agent for this purpose. The calculation agent\nmay be one of our affiliates and also may be The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany,\nN.A. For floating-rate notes, we will identify in the applicable supplement the\ninitial calculation agent we have appointed for a particular series of debt\nsecurities as of the original issue date for such debt securities. For\nfixed/floating rate\nnotes and fixed-rate reset notes, we may identify the initial calculation agent in\nthe applicable supplement or we may appoint the calculation agent for a particular\nseries of debt securities after the original issue date for such debt securities,\nat any time prior to the commencement of the first floating-rate period, in the\ncase of fixed/floating rate notes, or before the first date on which a calculation\nis required to be performed, in the case of fixed-rate reset notes. We may remove\nand/or appoint different calculation agents from time to time after the original\nissue date for a series of debt securities, or we may elect to act as the\ncalculation agent with respect to such debt securities, in each case without your\nconsent and\nwithout notifying you of the change. Absent manifest error, all determinations of\nthe calculation agent will be final and binding on you, the trustee and us.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount Notes\n\nAny of the types of notes described above may be an original issue discount note.\nOriginal issue discount notes are debt securities that are\nissued at a price lower than their stated principal amount or lower than their\nminimum guaranteed repayment amount at maturity. Original issue discount notes may\nbe zero coupon notes or may bear interest at a rate that is below market rates at\nthe\ntime of issuance. Amounts payable in the event of redemption, repayment or upon an\nacceleration of the maturity of an original issue discount note will be determined\nin accordance with the terms of that debt security, as described in the applicable\nsupplement. That amount normally is less than the amount payable at the maturity\ndate. A debt security issued at a discount to its principal may, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, be considered an original issue discount note, regardless of\nthe amount payable upon redemption or acceleration of maturity. See \u0093U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u0097Taxation of Debt Securities\u0094 below for a summary of the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of owning an original\nissue discount note.\n\nPayment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\n\nPaying Agents\n\nWe\nmay appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents.\nInitially, under the indentures, we have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon\nTrust Company, N.A. to act as our paying agent with respect to the debt securities\nthrough its\ncorporate trust office currently located at 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 300,\nJacksonville, Florida 32256. We may add, replace or terminate any paying agent\nfrom time to time in accordance with the applicable indenture, in each case\nwithout your\nconsent and without notifying you of such change. In addition, we may decide to\nact as our own paying agent with respect to some or all of the debt securities,\nand the paying agent may resign, in each case without your consent and without\nnotifying\nyou of such event.\n\n22\n\nPayments to Holders and Record Dates for Interest\n\nWe refer to each date on which interest is payable on a debt security as an\n\u0093interest payment date.\u0094 Subject to any applicable\nbusiness day convention set forth in the applicable supplement, interest payments\non the debt securities will be made on each interest payment date applicable to,\nand at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of, the applicable debt\nsecurities. Interest payable on any interest payment date other than the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, will be paid to the registered holder of the\ndebt security at the close of business on the regular record date for that\ninterest\npayment date. However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe initial interest payment on a debt security issued between a regular record\ndate and the interest payment date immediately following the regular record date\nwill be\nmade on the second interest payment date following the original issue date to the\nholder of record on the regular record date preceding the second interest payment\ndate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the principal and\ninterest payable at maturity, or earlier redemption, will be paid to the holder of\nthe debt security at the time of payment by the paying agent.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the record date for any\ninterest payment for a debt security in book-entry only form\nwill be the close of business on the date that is one business day prior to the\npayment date, unless such debt security is a non-U.S. dollar denominated debt\nsecurity held through DTC, in which case the record\ndate for an interest payment date will be the close of business on the fifteenth\ncalendar day prior to such interest payment date, whether or not such record date\nis a business day. If the debt security is in a form that is other than book-entry\nonly, and unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the regular\nrecord date for an interest payment date will be the close of business on the\nfifteenth calendar day prior to such interest payment date, whether or not such\nrecord date\nis a business day.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094\nmeans any weekday that is\nnot a legal holiday in New York, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, or any other\nplace of payment of the applicable debt security, and is not a date on which\nbanking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to\nbe closed.\n\nPayments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, our debt securities will\nbe denominated, and payments with respect to the debt\nsecurities will be made, in U.S. dollars. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, we will follow the practices described in this section when\nwe pay amounts that are due in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe will make payments on debt securities in book-entry only form in accordance\nwith arrangements then in place between the paying agent and\nthe depository or its nominee, as holder. An indirect owner\u0092s right to receive\nthose payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depository and\nits participants, as described below under the heading \u0093Registration and\nSettlement.\u0094\n\nIndirect owners should contact their banks or brokers for information on how they\nwill receive payments on their debt securities.\n\nWe will pay any interest on debt securities in definitive form on each interest\npayment date other than the\nmaturity date, or earlier redemption date, by, in our discretion, wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds or check mailed to holders of the debt securities on\nthe applicable record date at the address appearing on our or the security\nregistrar\u0092s records. We will pay\n\n23\n\nprincipal and any premium, interest, or other amounts payable at the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, of a debt security in definitive form by wire\ntransfer of immediately available\nfunds to the registered holders of the debt security at the time of payment.\n\nPayments Due in Other Currencies\n\nGeneral\n\nIf any\nof the debt securities are denominated, or if principal and any premium, interest,\nor other amounts payable on any of the debt securities is payable, in a foreign\ncurrency, the specified currency, as well as any additional investment\nconsiderations,\nrisk factors, restrictions, tax consequences, specific terms and other information\nrelating to that series of debt securities and the specified currency will be\ndescribed in the applicable supplement.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will follow the\npractices described in this section when we pay amounts that are\ndue on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, and except as described below, holders of non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities are not entitled to receive payments in U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency, either on a global debt security or\na debt security in definitive form.\n\nWe will make payments on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities in book-entry\nonly form in\nthe applicable specified currency in accordance with arrangements then in place\nbetween the paying agent and the depository or its nominee, as holder. An indirect\nowner\u0092s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and\npractices of the depository and its participants, as described below under the\nheading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities Held Through DTC\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, holders of beneficial interests in non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt securities through a participant in The Depository Trust Company,\nor \u0093DTC,\u0094 will receive payments in U.S.\ndollars, unless they elect to receive payments on those debt securities in the\napplicable foreign currency. If a holder of such beneficial interests through DTC\ndoes not make an election through its DTC participant to receive payments in the\napplicable foreign currency, the exchange rate agent for the relevant non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities to be appointed by us will convert payments to\nthat holder into U.S. dollars, and all costs of\nthose conversions will be borne by that holder by deduction from the applicable\npayments.\n\nThe holder of a beneficial interest in global non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities held through a DTC participant may elect to receive payments on those\ndebt securities in the foreign currency by notifying the DTC participant through\nwhich it holds its\nbeneficial interests on or prior to the fifteenth business day prior to the record\ndate for the applicable debt securities of (1) that holder\u0092s election to receive\nall or a portion of the payment in the applicable foreign currency and\n(2) wire transfer instructions to an account for the applicable foreign currency\noutside the United States. DTC must be notified of the election and wire transfer\ninstructions (a) on or prior to the fifth business day after the record date\nfor any payment of interest and (b) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to\nthe date for any payment of principal. DTC will notify the trustee or other\napplicable paying agent of the election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or\nprior to the fifth business day after the record date for any payment of interest\nand (2) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to the date for any payment of\nprincipal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by DTC\nthrough a DTC participant and forwarded by DTC to the trustee or other applicable\npaying agent and received on or prior to the dates described above, the holder\nwill receive payment in the applicable foreign currency outside DTC; otherwise,\nonly\nU.S. dollar payments will be made by the trustee or other applicable paying agent\nto DTC.\n\n24\n\nFor holders of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities held through a DTC participant not electing payment in the applicable\nforeign currency, the U.S. dollar amount of any payment will be the amount of the\napplicable foreign currency otherwise payable, converted into U.S. dollars at the\napplicable exchange rate prevailing as of 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the\nsecond business day prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by\nthe exchange rate agent for that conversion unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement. The costs of those conversions will be shared pro rata\namong the holders of beneficial interests in the applicable global debt securities\nreceiving U.S. dollar payments in the proportion of their respective holdings. The\nexchange rate agent, to be appointed by us at the time of issuance for such\nnon-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities held through a DTC participant, will\nmake those conversions in accordance with prevailing\nmarket practice and the terms of the applicable debt security and with any\napplicable arrangements between us and the exchange rate agent.\n\nIf an exchange rate quotation is unavailable from the entity or source ordinarily\nused by the exchange rate agent in the normal course of\nbusiness, the exchange rate agent will obtain a quotation from a leading foreign\nexchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate of the exchange rate\nagent or another entity selected by the exchange rate agent for that purpose after\nconsultation with us. If no quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is\navailable, payment will be made in the applicable foreign currency to the account\nor accounts specified by DTC to the trustee or other applicable paying agent,\nunless the\napplicable foreign currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange\ncontrols or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\nUnavailability of Currencies and Replacement Currencies\n\nIf, at or about the time of payment of any principal, premium or interest on a\nnon-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt security, the relevant specified currency is not legal\ntender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing the\ncurrency as of the original issue date of such debt security or is otherwise\nunavailable,\nand the relevant specified currency has been replaced by another currency that has\nbecome legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in such country (a\n\u0093replacement currency\u0094), any amount payable pursuant to such debt\nsecurity may be paid, at our option, in the replacement currency or in U.S.\ndollars, at a rate of exchange which takes into account the conversion, at the\nrate prevailing on the most recent date on which official conversion rates were\nquoted or set\nby the national government or other authority responsible for issuing the\nreplacement currency, from the specified currency to the replacement currency or\nto U.S. dollars, if applicable, and, if necessary, the conversion of the\nreplacement currency\ninto U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing on the date of such conversion. In this\ncircumstance, we will appoint a financial institution to act as exchange rate\nagent for purposes of making the required conversions in accordance with\nprevailing market\npractice and the terms of the applicable debt security and with any applicable\narrangements between us and the exchange rate agent.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the relevant specified currency may not be\navailable to us for making payments of principal of or any premium,\ninterest or other amounts payable on any non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities. This could occur due to the imposition of exchange controls or other\ncircumstances beyond our control, or if the specified\ncurrency is no longer used by the government of the country issuing that currency\nor by public institutions within the international banking community for the\nsettlement of transactions. If the specified currency is unavailable and has not\nbeen\nreplaced, and unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, we may\nsatisfy our obligations to holders of the relevant non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt securities by making those payments due in the\nrelevant specified currency on the date of payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of\nsuch payments made in U.S. dollars will be determined by an exchange rate agent to\nbe appointed by us on the basis of the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New\nYork for cable transfers of the specified currency or currencies in which a\npayment on any\n\n25\n\nsuch non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities was to be made, published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, which is referred to as the \u0093market exchange\nrate,\u0094 or such other rate as may be set forth in the applicable supplement. If\nthat rate of exchange is not then available or is not published for a particular\npayment currency, the market exchange rate will be based on the highest bid\nquotation in The City of New York received by the exchange rate agent at\napproximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding\nthe applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers for the\npurchase by the quoting dealer:\n                                                                                  \n      of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on the payment    \n      date;                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      in the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to those holders  \n      or beneficial owners of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities; and    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                     \n      at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  \n                                                                     \nOne of the dealers providing quotations may be the exchange rate agent unless the\nexchange rate agent is our affiliate. If those bid quotations are not available,\nthe exchange rate agent will determine the market exchange rate at its sole\ndiscretion in accordance with prevailing market practice and the terms of the\napplicable debt security and with any applicable arrangements between us and the\nexchange rate agent. The above provisions do not apply if a specified currency is\nunavailable because it has been replaced by the euro. If the euro has been\nsubstituted for a specified currency of the relevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt security, we may, at our option, or will, if required by applicable law,\nwithout the consent of the holders of the affected debt securities, pay the\nprincipal of and any premium, interest or other amounts payable on any\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities in euro instead of the specified\ncurrency, in conformity with legally applicable measures taken pursuant to, or by\nvirtue of, the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended. Any payment\nmade in U.S. dollars, an applicable replacement currency, or in euro as described\nabove where the required payment is in an unavailable specified currency will not\nconstitute an event of default under the relevant indenture or the applicable debt\nsecurities. The exchange rate agent to be appointed by us may be one of our\naffiliates, and, from time to time after the initial appointment of an exchange\nrate agent, we may appoint one or more different exchange rate agents for the\nrelevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security without your consent and without\nnotifying you of the change. The exchange rate agent will determine the applicable\nrate of exchange that would apply to a payment made in U.S. dollars or a\nreplacement currency in its sole discretion unless we state in the applicable\nsupplement that any determination requires our approval. Absent manifest error,\nthose determinations will be final and binding on you and us. For purposes of the\nabove discussion about currency conversions and payments on non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities, unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094 means any weekday that is not a legal holiday\nin New York, New York or Charlotte, North Carolina and is not a day on which\nbanking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to be closed. Indirect owners of a debt security with a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars should contact their banks or brokers for\ninformation about how to receive payments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars. 26\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities in Definitive Form We will pay any interest\non non-U.S. dollar-denominateddebt securities in definitive form on each interest\npayment date other than the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, by, in our\ndiscretion, wire transfer of immediately available funds or check mailed to\nholders of the debt securities on the applicable record date at the address\nappearing on our or the security registrar\u0092s records. Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, we will pay principal and any premium, interest, or\nother amounts payable at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of a\nnon-U.S. dollar-denominateddebt security in definitive form by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to the registered holders of the debt security at the\ntime of payment. No Sinking Fund Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, our debt securities will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking\nfund. This means that we will not deposit money on a regular basis into any\nseparate custodial account to repay the debt securities. Redemption The applicable\nsupplement will indicate whether we may redeem the debt securities prior to their\nstated maturity date. If we may redeem the debt securities prior to their stated\nmaturity date, the applicable supplement will indicate the redemption price, the\nmethod for redemption, and the date or dates upon which we may redeem the debt\nsecurities. Debt securities to be redeemed in part may only be redeemed in\nincrements of their minimum denomination. The redemption of any debt security that\nis our eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if\nafter such redemption we would fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD\nor total loss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules. In addition, unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, to the extent then required by\napplicable laws or regulations, our subordinated debt securities may not be\nredeemed prior to their stated maturity date without the requisite prior\napprovals, if any, from applicable regulators. Notice of Redemption Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we may exercise our right to\nredeem debt securities by giving notice to the holders under the applicable\nindenture at least 5 business days but not more than 60 calendar days before the\nspecified redemption date. The notice will specify:\n                                      \n      the date fixed for redemption;  \n                                      \n                                                                                  \n      the redemption price (or, if not then ascertainable, the manner of          \n      calculation thereof);                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the CUSIP number and any other identifying number of the debt securities    \n      to be redeemed;                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the amount to be redeemed, if less than all of the outstanding debt         \n      securities of a series are to be redeemed;                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                    \n      the place of payment for the debt securities to be redeemed;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n      that interest (if any) accrued on the debt securities to be redeemed will   \n      be paid as specified in the notice; and                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      that, subject to satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption set      \n      forth in the notice of redemption and                                       \n      unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the      \n      date fixed for redemption, interest (if any) will cease to accrue on the    \n      debt securities to be redeemed.                                             \n                                                                                  \n27\n\nSuch redemption may be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions\nprecedent, in which case the notice of redemption will describe each condition\nand, if applicable, state that the redemption date may, in our discretion, be\ndelayed until such time as any or all conditions have been satisfied, or such\nredemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or\nall of the conditions have not been satisfied by the redemption date stated in the\nnotice of redemption, or by the redemption date as it may be delayed in our\ndiscretion. If notice of redemption has been given in accordance with the\napplicable indenture, the debt securities being redeemed shall, subject to the\nsatisfaction of any conditions to the redemption as specified in the notice of\nredemption, become due and payable on the date fixed for redemption. So long as a\ndepository is the record holder of the applicable debt securities to be redeemed,\nwe, or the trustee on our behalf if we so request, will deliver any notice of our\nelection to exercise our redemption right only to that depository. Repayment The\napplicable supplement will indicate whether the debt securities can be repaid at\nthe holder\u0092s option prior to their stated maturity date. If the debt securities\nmay be repaid prior to their stated maturity date, the applicable supplement will\nindicate the applicable repayment price or prices, the procedures for repayment\nand the date or dates on or after which the holder can request repayment.\nRepurchase We may purchase at any time and from time to time, including through a\nsubsidiary or affiliate of ours, outstanding debt securities by tender, in the\nopen market, or by private agreement. The repurchase of any debt security that is\nour eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if after\nsuch repurchase we would fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules. We, or our affiliates, have\nthe discretion to hold or resell any repurchased debt securities. We also have the\ndiscretion to cancel any repurchased debt securities. Conversion We may issue debt\nsecurities that are convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, at\neither our option or the holder\u0092s option or otherwise as provided in the\napplicable supplement, our preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, or\nother debt securities. The applicable supplement will describe the terms of any\nconversion, exercise, or exchange features, including:\n                                                                                  \n      the periods during which conversion, exercise, or exchange, as applicable,  \n      may be elected;                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the conversion, exercise, or exchange price payable and the number of       \n      shares or amount of our preferred stock,                                    \n      depositary shares, common stock, or other debt securities, that may be      \n      issued upon conversion, exercise, or exchange, and any adjustment           \n      provisions; and                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the procedures for electing conversion, exercise, or exchange, as           \n      applicable.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nExchange, Registration, and Transfer Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, we will issue each debt security in global, or book-entry only, form.\nDebt securities in global form may be exchanged for debt securities in definitive\nform only in the limited circumstances described in the relevant debt securities\nor in the applicable indenture. 28\n\nSubject to the terms of the applicable indenture, debt securities of any series in\ndefinitive form may be exchanged at the option of the holder for other debt\nsecurities of the same series and of an equal aggregate principal amount and type\nin any authorized denominations.\n\nDebt securities in definitive form may be presented for registration of transfer\nat the office of the security registrar or at the office of\nany transfer agent that we designate and maintain. The security registrar or the\ntransfer agent will make the registration of transfer only if it is satisfied with\nthe documents of title and identity of the person making the request. There will\nnot\nbe a service charge for any exchange or registration of transfer of debt\nsecurities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or\nother governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with the exchange or\ntransfer. Unless\nwe specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, initially, The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A. will be the authenticating agent, security registrar,\nand transfer agent for the debt securities issued under the respective\nindentures. We may change the security registrar or the transfer agent or approve\na change in the location through which any security registrar or transfer agent\nacts at any time, in each case without your consent and without notifying you of\nsuch\nevent. We will be required to maintain a security registrar and transfer agent in\neach place of payment for each series of debt securities. At any time, we may\ndesignate additional transfer agents for any series of debt securities.\n\nWe will not be required to (1) issue, exchange, or register the transfer of any\ndebt security of any series to be redeemed for a period\nof 15 days before the date on which we deliver the notice of redemption or (2)\nexchange or register the transfer of any debt security (i) that was selected,\ncalled, or is being called for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of\nany debt security being redeemed in part or (ii) as to which the holder has\nexercised any right to require us to repay such debt security, except the portion\nto remain outstanding of any debt security being repaid in part.\n\nFor a discussion of restrictions on the exchange, registration, and transfer of\nbook-entry only securities, see \u0093Registration and\nSettlement\u0094 below.\n\nSubordination\n\nOur subordinated debt securities are subordinated and junior in right of payment\nto all of our \u0093senior indebtedness.\u0094 The\nSubordinated Indenture defines \u0093senior indebtedness\u0094 as any indebtedness for money\nborrowed, including all of our indebtedness for borrowed and purchased money, all\nof our obligations arising from\noff-balance sheet guarantees and direct credit substitutes, and our obligations\nassociated with derivative products such as interest and foreign exchange rate\ncontracts and commodity contracts, that was\noutstanding on the date we executed the Subordinated Indenture, or was created,\nincurred, or assumed after that date, for which we are responsible or liable as\nobligor, guarantor, or otherwise, and all deferrals, renewals, extensions, and\nrefundings\nof that indebtedness or obligations, other than the debt securities issued under\nthe Subordinated Indenture or any other indebtedness that by its terms is\nsubordinate in right of payment to any of our other indebtedness. Each supplement\nfor a series\nof subordinated debt securities will indicate the aggregate amount of our senior\nindebtedness outstanding, as of the most recent practicable date, and any\nlimitation on the issuance of additional senior indebtedness. As of December 31,\n2023, on\na non-consolidated basis, we had approximately $223 billion of senior long-term\ndebt and certain senior short-term borrowings. Senior indebtedness also includes\nour obligations under letters of credit,\nguarantees, foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts, none of\nwhich are included in such amount. In addition, holders of subordinated debt\nsecurities may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in\nthe event\nthat we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\n\n29\n\nIf there is a default or event of default under any senior indebtedness that would\nallow acceleration of maturity of that senior indebtedness and that default or\nevent of default is not remedied, and we and the trustee of the Subordinated\nIndenture receive notice of this default from the holders of at least 10% in\nprincipal amount of any kind or category of any senior indebtedness or if the\ntrustee of the Subordinated Indenture receives notice from us, then we will not be\nable to make any principal, premium, interest, or other payments on the\nsubordinated debt securities or repurchase our subordinated debt securities. If\nany subordinated debt security is declared due and payable before the stated\nmaturity date (or other date for payment of principal) upon a payment or\ndistribution of our assets to creditors pursuant to our dissolution, winding up,\nliquidation, or reorganization, whether voluntary or involuntary, we are required\nto pay all principal and any premium, interest, or other payments to holders of\nsenior indebtedness before any holders of subordinated debt are paid. In addition,\nif any amounts previously were paid to the holders of our subordinated debt\nsecurities or the trustee under the Subordinated Indenture, the holders of senior\nindebtedness will have first rights to the amounts previously paid. Subject to the\npayment in full of all our senior indebtedness, the holders of our subordinated\ndebt securities will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of our senior\nindebtedness to receive payments or distributions of our assets applicable to the\nsenior indebtedness until our subordinated debt securities are paid in full. For\npurposes of this subrogation, the subordinated debt securities will be subrogated\nequally and ratably with all our other indebtedness that by its terms ranks\nequally with our subordinated debt securities and is entitled to like rights of\nsubrogation. Due to differing subordination provisions in various series of\nsubordinated debt securities issued by us and our predecessors, in the event of a\ndissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or\nother proceeding, holders of subordinated debt securities may receive more or\nless, ratably, than holders of some other series of our outstanding subordinated\ndebt securities. Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of Principal Subsidiary Bank\nThe Senior Indenture prohibits the issuance, sale, or other disposition of capital\nstock, or securities convertible into or options, warrants, or rights to acquire\ncapital stock, of any Principal Subsidiary Bank (as defined below) or of any\nsubsidiary which owns shares of capital stock, or securities convertible into or\noptions, warrants, or rights to acquire capital stock, of any Principal Subsidiary\nBank, with the following exceptions:\n                                                                   \n      sales or other dispositions of directors\u0092 qualifying shares;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n      sales or other dispositions for fair market value, if, after giving effect  \n      to the disposition and to conversion                                        \n      of any shares or securities convertible into capital stock of a Principal   \n      Subsidiary Bank, we would own at least 80% of each class of the capital     \n      stock of that Principal Subsidiary Bank;                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      sales or other dispositions made in compliance with an order of a court or  \n      regulatory authority of competent                                           \n      jurisdiction;                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any sale by a Principal Subsidiary Bank of additional shares of its         \n      capital stock, securities convertible into                                  \n      shares of its capital stock, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe   \n      for or purchase shares of its capital stock, to its stockholders at any     \n      price, so long as before that sale we owned, directly or indirectly,        \n      securities of the same class and                                            \n      immediately after the sale, we owned, directly or indirectly, at least as   \n      great a percentage of each class of securities of the Principal Subsidiary  \n      Bank as we owned before the sale of additional securities; and              \n                                                                                  \n30\n                                                                                  \n      any issuance of shares of capital stock, or securities convertible into or  \n      options, warrants, or rights to                                             \n      subscribe for or purchase shares of capital stock, of a Principal           \n      Subsidiary Bank or any subsidiary which owns shares of capital stock, or    \n      securities convertible into or options, warrants, or rights to acquire      \n      capital stock, of any Principal                                             \n      Subsidiary Bank, to us or our wholly owned subsidiary.                      \n                                                                                  \nA \u0093Principal Subsidiary Bank\u0094 is defined in the Senior Indenture as any subsidiary\nbank with total assets equal to more than 10% of our total consolidated assets. As\nof the date of this prospectus, Bank of America, N.A. is our only Principal\nSubsidiary Bank. Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets Each indenture\ngenerally permits a consolidation or merger between us and another entity, subject\nto certain requirements. It also permits the sale, conveyance or transfer by us of\nall or substantially all of our assets, subject to certain requirements. These\ntransactions are permitted if:\n                                                                                  \n      the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than us, is organized and       \n      existing under the laws of the United                                       \n      States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia and      \n      expressly assumes all of our obligations under that indenture; and          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      immediately after the transaction, we (or any successor entity) are not in  \n      default in the performance of any                                           \n      covenant or condition under that indenture.                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe foregoing requirements do not apply in the case of a sale, conveyance or\ntransfer by us of all or substantially all of our assets to one or more entities\nthat are direct or indirect subsidiaries in which we and/or one or more of our\nsubsidiaries own more than 50% of the combined voting power. Upon any\nconsolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or transfer of this kind (other than,\nwhere permitted as described above, a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets to our direct or indirect subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries in which we own more than 50% of the combined voting power as\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph), the resulting or acquiring entity will be\nsubstituted for us in the applicable indenture with the same effect as if it had\nbeen an original party to that indenture. As a result, the successor entity may\nexercise our rights and powers under that indenture. Waiver of Covenants The\nholders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of all affected\nseries then outstanding under an indenture may waive compliance with some of the\ncovenants or conditions of that indenture. Modification of the Indentures We and\nthe trustee may modify the applicable indenture and the rights of the holders of\nthe debt securities with the consent of the holders of at least 50% of the\naggregate principal amount of all series of outstanding debt securities under that\nindenture affected by the modification. No modification may extend the fixed\nmaturity of, reduce the principal amount or redemption premium of, or reduce the\nrate of interest, or extend the time of payment of interest or other amounts due,\non any debt security without the consent of each holder affected by the\nmodification. No modification may reduce the percentage of debt securities that is\nrequired to consent to modification of an indenture without the consent of all\nholders of the debt securities outstanding under that indenture. 31\n\nIn addition, we and the trustee may execute supplemental indentures in some\ncircumstances without the consent of any holders of outstanding debt securities.\nFor purposes of determining the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities\noutstanding at any time in connection with any request, demand, authorization,\ndirection, notice, consent, or waiver under the applicable indenture, (1) the\nprincipal amount of any debt security issued with original issue discount is that\namount of principal that would be due and payable at that time upon a declaration\nof acceleration of the maturity of the original issue discount note, and (2) the\nprincipal amount of a debt security denominated in a foreign currency or currency\nunit is the U.S. dollar equivalent on the date of original issuance of the debt\nsecurity, determined as specified in the applicable supplement for that debt\nsecurity. Meetings and Action by Securityholders The trustee may call a meeting in\nits discretion, or upon request by us or the holders of at least 10% in principal\namount of a series of outstanding debt securities, by giving notice. If a meeting\nof holders is duly held, any resolution raised or decision taken in accordance\nwith the indenture will be binding on all holders of debt securities of that\nseries. Events of Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant Breaches The Senior\nIndenture defines an event of default for a series of senior debt securities as\nany one of the following events:\n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay principal of or any premium on any senior debt           \n      securities of that series when due and payable,                             \n      and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay interest on any senior debt securities of that series    \n      when due and payable, and continuance of                                    \n      such default for a period of 30 days;                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      specified events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation; and  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any other events of default specified for a series of senior debt           \n      securities pursuant to the Senior Indenture.                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Subordinated Indenture defines an event of default for subordinated debt\nsecurities only as our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy under U.S. federal\nbankruptcy laws (and, in the case of our involuntary bankruptcy, continuing for a\nperiod of 60 days) and any other events of default specified for a series of\nsubordinated debt securities pursuant to the Subordinated Indenture. Any\nadditional or different events of default for a series of senior or subordinated\ndebt securities will be specified in the applicable supplement. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable supplement, if an event of default under an indenture\noccurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the debt securities outstanding under the applicable indenture\n(or, in the case of an event of default with respect to a series of senior debt\nsecurities under the Senior Indenture, the holders of 25% in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding senior debt securities of all series affected) may\ndeclare the principal amount, or, if the debt securities are issued with original\nissue discount, such amount as described in the applicable supplement, of all debt\nsecurities (or the outstanding senior debt securities of all series affected, as\nthe case may be) to be due and payable immediately. The holders of a majority in\naggregate principal amount of the debt securities then outstanding (or of all\nseries affected, as the case may be), in some circumstances, may annul the\ndeclaration of acceleration and waive past defaults. 32\n\nWith respect to a failure on our part to observe or perform any of the covenants\nor agreements contained in the debt securities or in the applicable indenture\n(other than (i) with respect to senior debt securities, those for which\nacceleration rights are available as discussed above and (ii) with respect to\nsubordinated debt securities, default in payment of principal or interest), which\nfailure continues for a period of 90 days after the date on which written notice\nof such failure is given (a \u0093covenant breach\u0094), the trustee and the holders of the\ndebt securities may pursue certain remedies as described below or as set forth in\nthe applicable indenture. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\nan event of default will not occur under our senior debt securities, and neither\nthe trustee nor the holders of any senior debt securities will have the right to\naccelerate the payment of principal of such senior debt securities, as a result of\na covenant breach. In addition, an event of default will not occur, and neither\nthe trustee nor the holders of such senior debt securities will have the right to\naccelerate the payment of principal of such senior debt securities, as a result of\nour failure to pay principal of or premium on such senior debt securities when due\nand payable until such default has continued for a period of 30 days. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement, payment of principal of the\nsubordinated debt securities may not be accelerated in the case of a default in\nthe payment of principal or any premium, interest, or other amounts or a breach in\nthe performance of any of our other covenants. We are required periodically to\nfile with the trustees a certificate stating that we are not in default under any\nof the terms of the indentures. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for\nEnforcement by Trustee If (i) we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on\nany debt securities or (ii) we are over 30 calendar days late on an interest\npayment on the debt securities, the applicable trustee can demand that we pay to\nit, for the benefit of the holders of those debt securities, the amount which is\ndue and payable on those debt securities, including any interest incurred because\nof our failure to make that payment. In the event of our nonpayment of principal,\ninterest or any premium (which nonpayment for senior debt securities constitutes\nan event of default) or a covenant breach, the trustee may take appropriate\naction, including instituting judicial proceedings against us. In addition, a\nholder of our debt securities also may file suit to enforce our obligation to make\npayment of principal and any premium, interest, or other amounts payable on such\ndebt securities regardless of the actions taken by the trustee. The holders of a\nmajority in principal amount of each series of the debt securities then\noutstanding under an indenture may direct the time, method, and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee under that\nindenture. The trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and\nin certain other circumstances set forth in the applicable indenture. The trustee\nis not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable\nindenture at the request or direction of the holders of the debt securities unless\nthe holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity against expenses and\nliabilities. Limitation on Suits Each indenture provides that no individual holder\nof debt securities of any series may institute any action against us under that\nindenture, except actions for payment of overdue principal and interest, unless\nthe following actions have occurred:\n                                                                                  \n      the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of a    \n      continuing event of default or covenant                                     \n      breach;                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n33\n                                                                                  \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of such outstanding    \n      debt securities issued under the                                            \n      applicable indenture must have (1)\u00a0requested the trustee to institute       \n      proceedings in respect of such event of default or covenant breach and (2)  \n      offered the trustee indemnity against liabilities incurred by the trustee   \n      for taking such                                                             \n      action, which indemnity is reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the trustee must have failed to institute proceedings within 60 days after  \n      receipt of the request referred to                                          \n      above; and                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of a majority in principal amount of such outstanding debt      \n      securities issued under the applicable                                      \n      indenture must not have given direction to the trustee inconsistent with    \n      the request of the holders referred to above.                               \n                                                                                  \nHowever, the holder of any senior debt securities will have an absolute right to\nreceive payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the senior debt\nsecurity when due and to institute suit to enforce this payment, and the holder of\nany subordinated debt securities will have, subject to applicable subordination\nprovisions, the absolute right to receive payment of principal of and any premium\nand any interest on the subordinated debt security when due and to institute suit\nto enforce this payment. Payment of Additional Amounts If we so specify in the\napplicable supplement, and subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth\nbelow, we will pay to the holder of any debt security that is a \u0093non-U.S.\nperson\u0094additional amounts to ensure that every net payment on that debt security\nwill not be less, due to the payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then\notherwise due and payable. For this purpose, a \u0093net payment\u0094 on a debt security\nmeans a payment by us or any paying agent, including payment of principal and\ninterest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment, or other\ngovernmental charge of the United States (other than a territory or possession).\nThese additional amounts will constitute additional interest on the debt security.\nFor this purpose, U.S. withholding tax means a withholding tax of the United\nStates, other than a territory or possession. However, notwithstanding our\nobligation, if so specified, to pay additional amounts, we will not be required to\npay additional amounts in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through\n(15) below, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement.\n                                                                                  \n       Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on a debt security is  \n  (1)  reduced as a result of any tax,                                            \n       assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld       \n       solely by reason of the beneficial owner of the debt security:             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      having a relationship with the United States as a citizen, resident, or     \n      otherwise;

Redemption for Tax Reasons If we so specify\nin the applicable supplement, we may redeem the debt securities in whole, but not\nin part, at any time before maturity, if we have or will become obligated to pay\nadditional amounts, as described above under \u0093\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094 as\na result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United\nStates or any political subdivision or any authority of the United States having\npower to tax, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such\nlaws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the\ndate of the applicable supplement for the issuance of those debt securities. If we\nexercise such right to redeem the debt securities, unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, we will give not less than 5 business days\u0092 nor more\nthan 60 calendar days\u0092 notice to the trustee under the applicable indenture and to\nthe holders of the debt securities. In connection with any notice of redemption\nfor tax reasons, we will deliver to the trustee under the indenture any required\ncertificate, request, or order. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, any debt securities redeemed for tax reasons will be redeemed at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such debt securities,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date\nfixed for redemption. 37\n\nDefeasance and Covenant Defeasance If we so specify in the applicable supplement,\nthe provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance described below will\napply to the debt securities of a series if certain conditions are satisfied. Full\nDefeasance. If there is a change in the U.S. federal income tax law, as described\nbelow, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on\nthe debt securities of a series. This is called full defeasance. For us to do so,\namong other conditions set forth in the applicable indenture, each of the\nfollowing must occur:\n                                                                                  \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the benefit of the holders    \n      of those debt securities a combination                                      \n      of money and U.S.\u00a0government or U.S.\u00a0government agency notes or bonds       \n      that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public  \n      accountants, will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, and     \n      any other payments on                                                       \n      those debt securities when due;                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      There must be a change in current U.S.\u00a0federal income tax law or an         \n      Internal Revenue Service ruling that                                        \n      lets us make the above deposit without causing the beneficial owners to be  \n      taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes on those debt securities any     \n      differently than if we did not make the deposit and repaid those debt       \n      securities ourselves;\u00a0and                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the indenture a legal opinion of our   \n      counsel confirming the tax law                                              \n      treatment described above.                                                  \n                                                                                  \nIf we ever fully defeased your debt security, you would have to rely solely on the\ntrust deposit for payments on your debt security. Covenant Defeasance.Under\ncurrent U.S. federal income tax law, we can make the same type of deposit\ndescribed above and be released from restrictive covenants relating to your debt\nsecurity. This is called covenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the\nprotection of those restrictive covenants. In order to achieve covenant defeasance\nfor a series of debt securities, among other conditions set forth in the\napplicable indenture, we must do both of the following:\n                                                                                  \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the benefit of the holders    \n      of those debt securities a combination                                      \n      of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds       \n      that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public  \n      accountants, will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, and     \n      any other payments on those debt                                            \n      securities on their due dates;\u00a0and                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the indenture a legal opinion of our   \n      counsel confirming that under current                                       \n      U.S. federal income tax law we may make the above deposit without causing   \n      the beneficial owners to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes on   \n      those debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit   \n      and repaid the debt                                                         \n      securities ourselves.                                                       \n                                                                                  \nIf we achieve covenant defeasance with respect to your debt security, you can\nstill look to us for repayment of your debt security in the event of any shortfall\nin the trust deposit. You should note, however, that if one of the remaining\nevents of default occurred, such as our bankruptcy, and your debt security became\nimmediately due and payable, there may be a shortfall. Depending on the event\ncausing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall. 38\n\nSatisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture The indenture under which a series of\ndebt securities has been issued will cease to be of further effect with respect to\nthe debt securities of such series, if at any time:\n                                                                                  \n      We have delivered to the trustee for cancellation all debt securities of    \n      such series; or                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      All debt securities of such series not delivered to the trustee for         \n      cancellation have become due and payable, or                                \n      will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for        \n      redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee   \n      for the giving of notice of redemption, and we have irrevocably deposited   \n      with the trustee or the                                                     \n      applicable paying agent as trust funds for the entire amount in cash due    \n      with respect to such debt securities on or after the date of such deposit,  \n      including at maturity or upon redemption of all such debt securities,       \n      including principal and any                                                 \n      premium, interest and other amounts payable, and any mandatory sinking      \n      fund payments, on the dates on which such payments are due and payable.     \n                                                                                  \nThe trustee, on our demand, accompanied by an officer\u0092s certificate of ours and an\nopinion of counsel and at our cost and expense, will execute proper instruments\nacknowledging such satisfaction of and discharging the applicable indenture with\nrespect to such debt securities. Notices We or the trustee on our behalf, if so\nrequested, will provide the holders with any required notices by first-class mail\nto the addresses of the holders as they appear in the security register. So long\nas a depository is the record holder of a series of debt securities with respect\nto which a notice is given, we or the trustee, if so requested, will deliver the\nnotice only to that depository in accordance with the procedures of that\ndepository then in place. Concerning the Trustee We and certain of our affiliates\nhave from time to time maintained deposit accounts and conducted other banking\ntransactions with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its\naffiliates in the ordinary course of business. We expect to continue these\nbusiness transactions. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is\ninitially serving as the trustee for the debt securities issued under the Senior\nIndenture and the Subordinated Indenture. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A. and its affiliates also serve as trustee for a number of series of\noutstanding indebtedness of us and our affiliates under other indentures.\nConsequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to\nany of these securities, the trustee may be considered to have a conflicting\ninterest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that\ncase, the trustee may be required to resign under one or more of the indentures,\nand we would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a\n\u0093potential\u0094 event of default means an event that would be an event of default if\nthe requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist\nfor a specific period of time were disregarded. In addition, the trustee can\nresign for any reason by giving at least 30 calendar days\u0092 written notice of\nresignation, and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee. The trustee\nwill remain the trustee under the applicable indenture until a successor is\nappointed. Governing Law The indentures are and the debt securities will be\ngoverned by New York law. 39\n\nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS General The warrants are options that are securities\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(a)(17) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u0093Securities Act\u0094). We may issue warrants, including securities warrants,\nindex warrants and currency warrants. We may offer warrants separately or as part\nof a unit, as described below under the heading \u0093Description of Units.\u0094 If we\nissue warrants as part of a unit, the applicable supplement will specify whether\nthose warrants may be separated from the other securities in the unit prior to the\nwarrants\u0092 expiration date. Universal warrants issued in the United States may not\nbe so separated prior to the 91st day after the issuance of the unit, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. We may issue warrants in any\namounts or in as many distinct series as we determine. We will issue each series\nof warrants under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a\nwarrant agent to be designated in the applicable supplement. When we refer to a\nseries of warrants, we mean all warrants issued as part of the same series under\nthe applicable warrant agreement. Any warrants that we issue will contain, to the\nextent required, contractual provisions required to comply with the \u0093Restrictions\non Qualified Financial Contracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking\nOrganizations and the U.S. Operations of Systemically Important Foreign Banking\nOrganizations; Revisions to the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement\nand Related Definitions\u0094 as issued by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other\napplicable law. This section describes some of the general terms and provisions of\nthe warrants. We will describe the specific terms of a series of warrants and the\napplicable warrant agreement in the applicable supplement. The following\ndescription and any description of the warrants in the applicable supplement may\nnot be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe terms and provisions of the applicable warrant agreement. A warrant agreement\nreflecting the particular terms and provisions of a series of offered warrants\nwill be filed with the SEC in connection with the offering and incorporated by\nreference in the registration statement and this prospectus. See \u0093Where You Can\nFind More Information\u0094 below for information on how to obtain copies of any\nwarrant agreements. Description of Securities Warrants We may issue warrants for\nthe purchase of our debt securities, common stock or preferred stock.

We refer to this type of warrant\nas an \u0093index warrant.\u0094 Description of Currency Warrants We may also issue warrants\nentitling the holders thereof to receive from us, upon exercise, an amount in cash\ndetermined by reference to decreases or increases in the price or level (or\nrelative price, level or exchange rate) of specified amounts of one or more\ncurrencies or currency units, providedthat these warrants will be listed on a\nnational securities exchange. We refer to this type of warrant as a \u0093currency\nwarrant.\u0094 41\n\nModification\n\nWe and the warrant agent may amend the terms of any warrant agreement and the\nwarrants without the consent of the holders of the applicable\nwarrants to cure any ambiguity, to correct any inconsistent provision, or in any\nother manner we deem necessary or desirable and which will not affect adversely\nthe interests of the holders. In addition, we may amend any warrant agreement and\nthe\nterms of the applicable warrants with the consent of the holders of a majority of\nthe outstanding unexercised warrants affected. However, any modification to the\nwarrants cannot change the exercise price, reduce the amounts receivable upon\nexercise,\ncancellation, or expiration, shorten the time period during which such warrants\nmay be exercised, or otherwise materially and adversely affect the rights of the\nholders of such warrants or reduce the percentage of outstanding warrants required\nto\nmodify or amend the warrant agreement or the terms of such warrants, without the\nconsent of the affected holders.\n\nEnforceability of Rights of Warrantholders; No Trust Indenture Act Protection\n\nThe warrant agent will act solely as our agent and will not assume any obligation\nor relationship of agency or trust with the holders of the\nwarrants. Any record holder or beneficial owner of a warrant, without anyone\nelse\u0092s consent, may enforce by appropriate legal action, on his or her own behalf,\nhis or her right to exercise the warrant in accordance with its terms. A holder of\na\nwarrant will not be entitled to any of the rights of a holder of the debt\nsecurities or other securities or warrant property purchasable upon the exercise\nof the warrant, including any right to receive payments on those securities or\nwarrant\nproperty or to enforce any covenants or rights in the relevant indenture or any\nother agreement, before exercising the warrant.\n\nNo\nwarrant agreement will be qualified as an indenture, and no warrant agent under\nany warrant agreement will be required to qualify as a trustee, under the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. Therefore, holders of warrants issued under a warrant\nagreement will not have the protection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with\nrespect to their warrants.\n\n42\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS General We may issue purchase contracts in any\namounts and in as many distinct series as we determine.

Applicability of Indenture Purchase contracts may\nrequire holders to satisfy their obligations under the purchase contracts at the\ntime they are issued. We refer to these contracts as \u0093prepaid purchase contracts.\u0094\n44\n\nIn certain circumstances, our obligation to settle a prepaid purchase contract on\nthe relevant settlement date may constitute our senior debt securities or our\nsubordinated debt securities. Accordingly, prepaid purchase contracts may be\nissued under the indentures, which are described above under the heading\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities.\u0094 Non-PrepaidPurchase Contracts; No Trust\nIndenture Act Protection Some purchase contracts do not require holders to satisfy\ntheir obligations under the purchase contracts until settlement. We refer to these\ncontracts as \u0093non-prepaidpurchase contracts.\u0094 The holder of a non-prepaidpurchase\ncontract may remain obligated to perform under the contract for a substantial\nperiod of time. Non-prepaidpurchase contracts will be issued under a unit\nagreement, if they are issued in units, or under some other document, if they are\nnot. We describe unit agreements generally under the heading \u0093Description of\nUnits\u0094 below. We will describe the particular governing document that applies to\nyour non-prepaidpurchase contracts in the applicable supplement. Non-\nprepaidpurchase contracts will not be our senior debt securities or subordinated\ndebt securities and will not be issued under one of our indentures, unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement. Consequently, no governing\ndocuments for non-prepaidpurchase contracts will be qualified as indentures, and\nno third party will be required to qualify as a trustee with regard to those\ncontracts, under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Therefore, holders of non-\nprepaidpurchase contracts will not have the protection of the Trust Indenture Act\nof 1939. Pledge by Holders to Secure Performance If we so specify in the\napplicable supplement, the holder\u0092s obligations under the purchase contract and\ngoverning document will be secured by collateral. In that case, the holder, acting\nthrough the unit agent as its attorney-in-fact,if applicable, will pledge the\nitems described below to a collateral agent that we will identify in the\napplicable supplement, which will hold them, for our benefit, as collateral to\nsecure the holder\u0092s obligations. We refer to this as the \u0093pledge\u0094 and all the\nitems described below as the \u0093pledged items.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the pledge will create a security interest in the holder\u0092s\nentire interest in and to:\n                                                                                  \n      any other securities included in the unit, if the purchase contract is      \n      part of a unit, and/or any other property                                   \n      specified in the applicable supplement;                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                 \n      all additions to and substitutions for the pledged items;  \n                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n      all income, proceeds, and collections received in respect of the pledged    \n      items;\u00a0and                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      all powers and rights owned or acquired later with respect to the pledged   \n      items.                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe collateral agent will forward all payments and proceeds from the pledged items\nto us, unless the payments and proceeds have been released from the pledge in\naccordance with the purchase contract and the governing document. We will use the\npayments and proceeds from the pledged items to satisfy the holder\u0092s obligations\nunder the purchase contract. Settlement of Purchase Contracts that Are Part of\nUnits Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, where purchase\ncontracts issued together with debt securities as part of a unit require the\nholders to buy purchase contract property, the unit agent may apply principal\npayments from the debt securities in satisfaction of 45\n\nthe holders\u0092 obligations under the related purchase contract as specified in the\napplicable supplement. The unit agent will not so apply the principal payments if\nthe holder has delivered\ncash to meet its obligations under the purchase contract. If the holder is\npermitted to settle its obligations by cash payment, the holder may be permitted\nto do so by delivering the debt securities in the unit to the unit agent as\nprovided in the\ngoverning document. If the holder settles its obligations in cash rather than by\ndelivering the debt security that is part of the unit, that debt security will\nremain outstanding, if the maturity extends beyond the relevant settlement date\nand, as\nmore fully described in the applicable supplement, the holder will receive that\ndebt security or an interest in the relevant global debt security.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for\ninformation on how to settle their purchase contracts.\n\nFailure of Holder to Perform Obligations\n\nIf the holder fails to settle its obligations under a non-prepaid purchase\ncontract as required, the\nholder will not receive the purchase contract property or other consideration to\nbe delivered at settlement. Holders that fail to make timely settlement also may\nbe obligated to pay interest or other amounts.\n\n46\n\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS General We may issue units from time to time in such amounts\nand in as many distinct series as we determine. We will issue each series of units\nunder a unit agreement to be entered into between us and a unit agent to be\ndesignated in the applicable supplement. When we refer to a series of units, we\nmean all units issued as part of the same series under the applicable unit\nagreement. Any units that we issue will contain, to the extent required,\ncontractual provisions required to comply with the \u0093Restrictions on Qualified\nFinancial Contracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking Organizations and the\nU.S. Operations of Systemically Important Foreign Banking Organizations; Revisions\nto the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and Related Definitions\u0094\nas issued by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other applicable law. This\nsection describes some of the general terms and provisions applicable to all the\nunits. We will describe the specific terms of a series of units and the applicable\nunit agreement in the applicable supplement. The following description and any\ndescription of the units in the applicable supplement may not be complete and is\nsubject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and provisions\nof the applicable unit agreement. A unit agreement reflecting the particular terms\nand provisions of a series of offered units will be filed with the SEC in\nconnection with the offering and incorporated by reference in the registration\nstatement and this prospectus. See \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094 below for\ninformation on how to obtain copies of any unit agreements. We may issue units\nconsisting of one or more securities described in this prospectus or, in any\ncombination. Each unit will be issued so that the holder of the unit is also the\nholder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have\nthe rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. The unit\nagreement under which a unit is issued may provide that the securities included in\nthe unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time or at any time\nbefore a specified date. If units are offered, the applicable supplement will\ndescribe the terms of the units, including the following:\n                                                                                  \n      the designation and aggregate number of, and the price at which we will     \n      issue, the units;                                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the terms of the units and of the securities comprising the units,          \n      including whether and under what circumstances                              \n      the securities comprising the units may or may not be held or transferred   \n      separately;                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                   \n      the name of the unit agent;  \n                                   \n                                                                                  \n      a description of the terms of any unit agreement to be entered into         \n      between us and a bank or trust company, as                                  \n      unit agent, governing the units;                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                \n      if applicable, a discussion of the U.S.\u00a0federal income tax consequences;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                        \n      whether the units will be listed on any securities exchange;\u00a0and  \n                                                                        \n47\n                                                                                  \n      a description of the provisions for the payment, settlement, transfer, or   \n      exchange of the units.                                                      \n                                                                                  \nUnit Agreements: Prepaid, Non-Prepaid,and Other If a unit includes one or more\npurchase contracts, and all those purchase contracts are prepaid purchase\ncontracts, we will issue the unit under a \u0093prepaid unit agreement.\u0094 Prepaid unit\nagreements will reflect the fact that the holders of the related units have no\nfurther obligations under the purchase contracts included in their units. If a\nunit includes one or more non-prepaidpurchase contracts, we will issue the unit\nunder a \u0093non-prepaidunit agreement.\u0094 Non-prepaidunit agreements will reflect the\nfact that the holders have payment or other obligations under one or more of the\npurchase contracts comprising their units. We may also issue units under other\nkinds of unit agreements, which will be described in the applicable supplement, if\napplicable. Each holder of units issued under a non-prepaidunit agreement will:\n                                                                                  \n      be bound by the terms of each non-prepaid purchase contract included in     \n      the holder\u0092s units and by the terms of the unit agreement with respect to    \n      those contracts;\u00a0and                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      appoint the unit agent as its authorized agent to execute, deliver, and     \n      perform on the holder\u0092s behalf each non-prepaid purchase contract included   \n      in the holder\u0092s units.                                                       \n                                                                                  \nAny unit agreement for a unit that includes a non-prepaidpurchase contract also\nwill include provisions regarding the holder\u0092s pledge of collateral and special\nsettlement provisions. These are described above under the heading \u0093Description of\nPurchase Contracts.\u0094 A unit agreement also may serve as the governing document for\na security included in a unit. For example, a non-prepaidpurchase contract that is\npart of a unit may be issued under and governed by the relevant unit agreement.\nModification We and the unit agent may amend the terms of any unit agreement and\nthe units without the consent of the applicable holders to cure any ambiguity, to\ncorrect any inconsistent provision, or in any other manner we deem necessary or\ndesirable and which will not affect adversely the interests of such holders. In\naddition, we may amend any unit agreement and the terms of the units with the\nconsent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding unexpired units affected.\nHowever, any modification to the applicable units that materially and adversely\naffects the rights of the holders of such units, or reduces the percentage of\noutstanding units required to modify or amend the unit agreement or the terms of\nsuch units, requires the consent of the affected holders. Enforceability of Rights\nof Unitholders; No Trust Indenture Act Protection The unit agent will act solely\nas our agent and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust\nwith the holders of the units. Except as described below, any record holder of a\nunit, without anyone else\u0092s consent, may enforce his or her rights as holder under\nany security included in the unit, in accordance with the terms of the included\nsecurity and the indenture, warrant agreement, unit agreement, or purchase\ncontract under which that security is issued. We describe these terms in other\nsections of this prospectus relating to debt securities, warrants, and purchase\ncontracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a unit agreement may limit or otherwise\naffect the ability of a holder of units issued under that agreement to enforce his\nor her rights, including any right to bring legal action, with respect to those\nunits or any included securities, other than debt securities. We will describe any\nlimitations of this kind in the applicable supplement. 48\n\nNo unit agreement will be qualified as an indenture, and no unit agent will be\nrequired to\nqualify as a trustee under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Therefore, holders of\nunits issued under a unit agreement will not have the protection of the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939 with respect to their units.\n\n49\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK General We may issue preferred stock in one or more\nseries, each with the preferences, designations, limitations, conversion rights,\nand other rights as we may determine.

Shares represented by an existing certificate\nwill remain certificated until such certificate is surrendered to us. This section\nsummarizes the general terms and provisions of our preferred stock. You also\nshould refer to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the respective\ncertificates of 50\n\ndesignations for each series of our preferred stock. We have filed our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation as an exhibit to the registration statement of which\nthis prospectus forms a part, and we will file with the SEC the certificate of\ndesignations with respect to the particular series of preferred stock being\noffered promptly after the offering of that series of preferred stock. Dividends\nThe holders of our preferred stock will be entitled to receive when, as, and if\ndeclared by our board of directors, cash dividends at those rates as will be fixed\nby our board of directors, subject to the terms of our Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation. All dividends will be paid out of funds that are legally available\nfor this purpose. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwhenever dividends on any non-votingpreferred stock are in arrears for three or\nmore semi-annual dividend periods or six quarterly dividend periods, as applicable\n(whether or not consecutive), holders of the non-votingpreferred stock will have\nthe right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors,\nand these two additional directors will continue to serve until full dividends on\nsuch non-votingpreferred stock have been paid regularly for at least two semi-\nannual or four quarterly dividend periods. Voting The holders of our preferred\nstock will have no voting rights except:\n                                         \n      as required by applicable law;\u00a0or  \n                                         \n                                                                  \n      as specifically approved by us for that particular series.  \n                                                                  \nUnder regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, if the holders of any series of\nour preferred stock become entitled to vote for the election of directors because\ndividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be deemed a \u0093class\nof voting securities.\u0094 In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a\nholder of such lower amount of the series as may be deemed, when coupled with\nother factors, to constitute a \u0093controlling influence\u0094 over us, may then be\nsubject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with The Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956. In addition, (1) any other bank holding company may\nbe required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire or\nretain 5% or more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding\ncompany may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire\nor retain 10% or more of that series. Liquidation Preference In the event of our\nvoluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, the holders of\nany series of our preferred stock will be entitled to receive, after distributions\nto holders of any series or class of our capital stock ranking superior, an amount\nequal to the stated or liquidation value of the shares of the series plus an\namount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends. If the assets and funds to be\ndistributed among the holders of our preferred stock will be insufficient to\npermit full payment to the holders, then the holders of our preferred stock will\nshare ratably in any distribution of our assets in proportion to the amounts that\nthey otherwise would receive on their shares of our preferred stock if the shares\nwere paid in full. In addition, holders of our preferred stock, or depositary\nshares representing interests in our preferred stock, may be fully subordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.

A form of deposit agreement, including a form of depositary receipt,\nwas filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus\nforms\na part. See \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094 below for information on how to\nobtain copies of any deposit agreements and depositary receipts that we may file\nwith the SEC in connection with depositary shares that we may offer.\n\nForm of the Depositary Shares\n\nThe depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued under a\ndeposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the applicable\ndeposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, in\nproportion to the fractional interest of a share of preferred stock represented by\nthe applicable depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the\npreferred stock\nbeing represented, including dividend, voting, redemption, conversion, and\nliquidation rights, all as will be set forth in the applicable supplement relating\nto the depositary shares being offered. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable\nsupplement, we will issue depositary shares in book-entry only form. Depositary\nshares in book-entry only form will be represented by a global depositary receipt\ndeposited with and held in the name of a clearing system or its nominee.\nAccordingly,\nthe clearing system will be the registered holder of all the depositary shares\nrepresented by the global depositary receipt. Those who own beneficial interests\nin a global depositary receipt will do so through participants in that clearing\nsystem\u0092s book-entry system, and the rights of these indirect owners will be\ngoverned solely by the applicable procedures of the clearing system and its\nparticipants. We describe the procedures applicable to book-entry only securities\nbelow\nunder the heading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094 A global depositary receipt shall\nbe exchangeable for definitive depositary receipts only in certain circumstances.\n\nWithdrawal of Preferred Stock\n\nUnless the depositary shares have been called for redemption, a holder of\ndepositary shares may surrender his or her depositary receipts at\nthe principal office of the depository, pay any charges, and comply with any other\nterms as provided in the applicable deposit agreement for the number of shares of\npreferred stock underlying the depositary shares. A holder of depositary shares\nwho\nwithdraws shares of preferred stock will be entitled to receive whole shares of\npreferred stock on the basis set forth in the applicable supplement relating to\nthe depositary shares being offered.\n\nHowever, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, holders of\nwhole shares of preferred stock will not be entitled to deposit\nthose shares under the applicable deposit agreement or to receive depositary\nreceipts for those shares after the withdrawal. If the depositary shares\nsurrendered by the holder in connection with the withdrawal exceed the number of\ndepositary shares\nthat represent the number of whole shares of preferred stock to be withdrawn, the\ndepository will deliver to the holder at the same time a new depositary receipt\nevidencing the excess number of depositary shares.\n\n93\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nThe depository will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions\nreceived in respect of the preferred stock to the record holders\nof depositary shares relating to that preferred stock in proportion to the number\nof depositary shares owned by those holders. However, the depository will\ndistribute only the amount that can be distributed without attributing to any\nholder of\ndepositary shares a fraction of one cent. Any balance that is not distributed will\nbe added to and treated as part of the next sum received by the depository for\ndistribution to record holders.\n\nIf there is a distribution other than in cash, the depository will distribute\nproperty it receives to the record holders of depositary shares\nwho are entitled to that property. However, if the depository determines that it\nis not feasible to make this distribution of property, the depository, with our\napproval, may sell that property and distribute the net proceeds to the holders of\nthe\ndepositary shares.\n\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\n\nIf a series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares is redeemed, the\ndepositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received\nby the depository from the redemption, in whole or in part, of that series of\npreferred stock. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\ndepository will provide notice of redemption at least 30 and not more than 60\ncalendar days\nbefore the date fixed for redemption to the record holders of the depositary\nshares to be redeemed. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to\nthe applicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable on that series\nof the\npreferred stock.\n\nWhenever we redeem preferred stock held by the depository, the depository will\nredeem as of the same redemption date the\nnumber of depositary shares representing the shares of preferred stock so\nredeemed. If less than all of the depositary shares are redeemed, the depositary\nshares redeemed will be selected by lot or pro rata.\n\nAfter the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares called for redemption\nwill no longer be deemed to be outstanding. At that time, all\nrights of the holder of the depositary shares will cease, except the right to\nreceive any money or other property they become entitled to receive upon surrender\nto the depository of the depositary receipts.\n\nVoting the Deposited Preferred Stock\n\nAny voting rights of holders of the depositary shares are directly dependent on\nthe voting rights of the underlying preferred stock, which\ncustomarily have limited voting rights. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at\nwhich the holders of the preferred stock held by the depository are entitled to\nvote, the depository will mail the information contained in the notice of meeting\nto the\nrecord holders of the depositary shares relating to the preferred stock. Each\nrecord holder of depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date\nas the record date for the underlying preferred stock, will be entitled to\ninstruct the\ndepository as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of\npreferred stock underlying the holder\u0092s depositary shares. The depository will\nendeavor, insofar as practicable, to vote the amount of preferred stock underlying\nthe\ndepositary shares in accordance with these instructions. We will agree to take all\naction which may be deemed necessary by the depository to enable the depository to\ndo so. The depository will not vote any shares of preferred stock except to the\nextent it receives specific instructions from the holders of depositary shares\nrepresenting that number of shares of preferred stock.\n\n94\n\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement\n\nThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision\nof the applicable deposit agreement may be amended by\nagreement between us and the depository. However, any amendment which materially\nand adversely alters the rights of the existing holders of depositary shares will\nnot be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the record holders of\nat\nleast a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding. Either we or the\ndepository may terminate a deposit agreement if all of the outstanding depositary\nshares have been redeemed or if there has been a final distribution in respect of\nour\npreferred stock in connection with our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.\n\nCharges of Depository\n\nWe will pay all transfer and other taxes, assessments, and governmental charges\narising solely from the existence of the depository\narrangements. We will pay the fees of the depository in connection with the\ninitial deposit of the preferred stock and any redemption of the preferred stock.\nHolders of depositary receipts will pay transfer and other taxes, assessments, and\ngovernmental charges and any other charges as are expressly provided in the\napplicable deposit agreement to be for their accounts. The depository may refuse\nto effect any transfer of a depositary receipt or any withdrawals of preferred\nstock\nevidenced by a depositary receipt until all taxes, assessments, and governmental\ncharges with respect to the depositary receipt or preferred stock are paid by\ntheir holders.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe depository will forward to the holders of depositary shares all of our reports\nand communications which are delivered to the depository\nand which we are required to furnish to the holders of our preferred stock.\n\nNeither we nor the depository will be liable if we are\nprevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control in performing\nour obligations under the applicable deposit agreement. All of our obligations as\nwell as the depository\u0092s obligations under the applicable deposit agreement are\nlimited to performance of our respective duties set forth in the applicable\ndeposit agreement without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, and\nneither of us will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding\nrelating to any\ndepositary shares or preferred stock unless provided with satisfactory indemnity.\nWe, and the depository, may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or\ninformation provided by persons presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of\ndepositary shares, or other persons believed to be competent and on documents\nbelieved to be genuine.\n\nResignation and Removal of Depository\n\nThe depository may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election\nto do so, and we may remove\nthe depository at any time, in each case without your consent and without\nnotifying you of such event. Any resignation or removal will take effect only upon\nthe appointment of a successor depository and the successor depository\u0092s\nacceptance of\nthe appointment. Any successor depository must be a U.S. bank or trust company.\n\n95\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nThis section describes the general terms and provisions of the shares of our\ncommon stock.We also have filed our Restated Certificate\nof Incorporation and our bylaws as exhibits to the registration statement of which\nthis prospectus is a part. You should read our Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation and our bylaws for additional information about our common stock.\n\nGeneral\n\nAs of\nthe date of this prospectus, under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we\nare authorized to issue twelve billion eight hundred million (12,800,000,000)\nshares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which approximately 7.9\nbillion\nshares were outstanding on December 31, 2023. Our common stock trades on the New\nYork Stock Exchange under the symbol \u0093BAC.\u0094 As of December 31, 2023, approximately\n497 million shares were reserved for issuance in connection\nwith our various employee and director benefit plans, the conversion of\noutstanding securities convertible into shares of our common stock, and for other\npurposes. After taking into account the reserved shares, there were approximately\n4.4 billion authorized shares of our common stock available for issuance as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nShares of our common stock\nwill be uncertificated unless our board of directors by resolution determines\notherwise. Shares represented by an existing certificate will remain certificated\nuntil such certificate is surrendered to us.\n\nVoting and Other Rights\n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. There are no\ncumulative voting rights. In general, a majority of votes cast on\na matter is sufficient to take action upon routine matters, including the election\nof directors in an uncontested election. However, (1) amendments to our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation generally must be approved by the affirmative vote\nof the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock, and (2)\na merger, dissolution, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets\ngenerally must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of\nthe voting power of the outstanding stock.\n\nIn the event of our liquidation, holders of our common stock will be entitled to\nreceive pro\nrata any assets legally available for distribution to stockholders, subject to any\nprior rights of any preferred stock then outstanding.\n\nOur common stock does not have any preemptive rights, redemption privileges,\nsinking fund privileges, or conversion rights. All the\noutstanding shares of our common stock are, and upon proper conversion of any\nconvertible securities, all of the shares of our common stock into which those\nsecurities are converted will be, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.\n\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our\ncommon stock.\n\nDividends\n\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of\npreferred stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled\nto receive dividends or distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as\nour board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for payments.\nStock dividends, if any are declared, may be paid from our authorized but unissued\nshares\nof common stock.\n\n96\n\nCertain Anti-Takeover Matters\n\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party\nto acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from\nattempting to acquire control of us. For example, we are subject to Section 203 of\nthe Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for\nanother party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws may\nmake it less likely that our management would be changed or that someone would\nacquire voting\ncontrol of our company without our board\u0092s consent. These provisions could make it\nmore difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in\nthe best interest of our stockholders.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nOur board of directors can, at any time, under our Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation and without stockholder approval, issue one or more\nnew series of preferred stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock\nwithout stockholder approval could discourage or make more difficult attempts to\ntake control of our company through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or\notherwise.\nPreferred stock with special voting rights or other features issued to persons\nfavoring our management could stop a takeover by preventing the person trying to\ntake control of our company from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to take\ncontrol.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements\n\nOur bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder\nproposals relating to nominations for the election of directors or\nother business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures\nprovide that notice of such stockholder proposals must be timely given to our\ncorporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. The\nnotice\nmust contain certain information specified in the bylaws and must otherwise comply\nwith the bylaws.\n\nVacancies\n\nUnder our bylaws, a majority vote of our board of directors may increase or\ndecrease the number of directors. Any director may be removed at\nany time with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares then entitled to vote at an\nelection of directors. Any vacancy on our board of directors or newly created\ndirectorship\nwill be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, and\nthose newly elected directors will serve for a term expiring at the next annual\nmeeting of stockholders, and until such directors\u0092 successor has been elected and\nqualified.\n\nAmendment of Bylaws\n\nOur bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of our board of\ndirectors, subject to certain limitations in our bylaws. Our\nstockholders also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws.\n\n97\n\nREGISTRATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue the\nsecurities in registered, and not bearer, form. This means that\nour obligation runs to the holder of the security named on the face of the\nsecurity. Each debt security, warrant, purchase contract, unit and depositary\nshare issued in registered form will be represented either by a certificate issued\nin definitive\nform to a particular investor or by one or more global securities representing the\nentire series of securities. Shares of preferred stock and common stock will be\nuncertificated unless we specify otherwise.\n\nWe refer to those persons who have securities registered in their own names, on\nthe books that we or the trustee, warrant agent, registrar or\nother agent maintain for this purpose, as the \u0093holders\u0094 of those securities. These\npersons are the legal holders of the securities. We refer to those who, indirectly\nthrough others, own beneficial interests in securities that are not\nregistered in their own names as indirect owners or beneficial owners of those\nsecurities. As we discuss below, indirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in securities issued in global, or book-entry only, form or in street\nname will be\nindirect owners.\n\nBook-Entry Only Issuance\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement (and other than\nuncertificated preferred stock and common stock), we will issue each\nsecurity in global, or book-entry, form. This means that we will not issue\ncertificated securities in definitive form to investors. Instead, we will issue\nglobal securities in registered form representing the entire series of securities.\nEach global\nsecurity will be registered in the name of a financial institution or clearing\nsystem that holds the global security as depository on behalf of other financial\ninstitutions that participate in that depository\u0092s book-entry system. These\nparticipating institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the global\nsecurities on behalf of themselves or their customers.\n\nBecause securities issued in global form are registered in the name of the\ndepository, we will recognize only the depository as the holder of\nthe securities. This means that we will make all payments on the securities,\nincluding deliveries of any property other than cash, to the depository. The\ndepository passes along the payments it receives from us to its participants,\nwhich in turn\npass the payments along to their customers who are the beneficial owners. The\ndepository and its participants are not obligated to pass these payments along\nunder the terms of the securities. Instead, they do so under agreements they have\nmade with\none another or with their customers.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own securities issued in book-entry only form\ndirectly. Instead,\nthey will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker,\nor other financial institution that participates in the depository\u0092s book-entry\nsystem or holds an interest through a participant in the depository\u0092s\nbook-entry system. As long as the securities are issued in global form, investors\nwill be indirect owners, and not holders, of the securities. The depository will\nnot have knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities.\n\nDefinitive Securities\n\nIn the future, we may cancel a global security or we may issue securities\ninitially in non-global, or\ndefinitive, form. We do not expect to exchange global securities for certificated\nsecurities in definitive form registered in the names of the beneficial owners of\nthe global securities representing the securities except in the limited\ncircumstances\ndescribed in the relevant securities or in the indenture, agreement or other\ninstrument governing the relevant securities.\n\n98\n\nStreet Name Owners If we issue certificated securities in definitive form\nregistered in the names of the beneficial owners, investors may choose to hold\ntheir securities in their own names or in street name. Securities held by an\ninvestor in street name would be registered in the name of a bank, broker, or\nother financial institution that the investor chooses, and the investor would hold\nonly a beneficial interest in those securities through an account that he or she\nmaintains at that institution. For securities held in street name, we will\nrecognize only the intermediary banks, brokers, and other financial institutions\nin whose names the securities are registered as the holders of those securities,\nand we will make all payments on those securities, including deliveries of any\nproperty other than cash, to them. These institutions pass along the payments they\nreceive to their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only because they\nagree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required\nto do so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be indirect owners,\nnot holders, of those securities. Legal Holders Our obligations, as well as the\nobligations of the trustee under any indenture and the obligations, if any, of any\nwarrant agents, unit agents, depository for preferred stock represented by\ndepositary shares, and any other third parties employed by us, the trustee, or any\nof those agents, run only to the holders of the securities. We do not have\nobligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global securities, who\nhold the securities in street name, or who hold the securities by any other\nindirect means. This will be the case whether an investor chooses to be an\nindirect owner of a security or has no choice because we are issuing the\nsecurities only in global form. For example, once we make a payment or give a\nnotice to the holder, we have no further responsibility for that payment or notice\neven if that holder is required, under agreements with depository participants or\ncustomers or by law, to pass it along to the indirect owners, but does not do so.\nSimilarly, if we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose, such\nas to amend the indenture for a series of debt securities or the warrant agreement\nfor a series of warrants or the unit agreement for a series of units or to relieve\nus of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a\nparticular provision of an indenture, we would seek the approval only from the\nholders, and not the indirect owners, of the relevant securities. Whether and how\nthe holders contact the indirect owners is up to the holders. When we refer to\n\u0093you\u0094 in this prospectus, we mean those who invest in the securities being offered\nby this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect owners of those\nsecurities. When we refer to \u0093your securities\u0094 in this prospectus, we mean the\nsecurities in which you will hold a direct or indirect interest. Special\nConsiderations for Indirect Owners If you hold securities through a bank, broker,\nor other financial institution, either in book-entry only form or in street name,\nyou should check with your own institution to find out:\n                                                               \n      how it handles payments on your securities and notices;  \n                                                               \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                                                                  \n      whether and how you can instruct it to exercise any rights to purchase or   \n      sell warrant property under a warrant                                       \n      or purchase contract property under a purchase contract or to exchange or   \n      convert a security for or into other property;                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                           \n      how it would handle a request for the holders\u0092 consent, if required;  \n                                                                           \n99\n                                                                                  \n      whether and how you can instruct it to send you the securities registered   \n      in your own name so you can be a                                            \n      holder, if that is permitted in the future;                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      how it would exercise rights under the securities if there were a default   \n      or other event triggering the need for                                      \n      holders to act to protect their interests;\u00a0and                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      if the securities are in book-entry only form, how the depository\u0092s rules    \n      and procedures will affect these                                            \n      matters.                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nDepositories for Global Securities Each security issued in book-entry only form\nwill be represented by a global security that we deposit with and register in the\nname of one or more financial institutions or clearing systems, which we will\nselect, or their nominees. A financial institution or clearing system that we\nselect for this purpose is called the \u0093depository\u0094 for that security. A security\nusually will have only one depository, but it may have more. Each series of\nsecurities will have one or more of the following as the depositories:\n                                                                                \n      The Depository Trust\u00a0Company, New York, New York, which is known as \u0093DTC\u0094;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n      a financial institution holding the securities on behalf of Euroclear Bank  \n      SA/NV, which is known as                                                    \n      \u0093Euroclear\u0094;                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a financial institution holding the securities on behalf of Clearstream     \n      Banking S.A., Luxembourg, which is known                                    \n      as \u0093Clearstream, Luxembourg\u0094;                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which  \n      is known as \u0093CDS\u0094; and                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any other clearing system or financial institution that we identify in the  \n      applicable supplement.                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe depositories named above also may be participants in one another\u0092s clearing\nsystems. For example, if DTC is the depository for a global security, investors\nmay hold beneficial interests in that security through Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg as DTC participants. We will name the depository or depositories for\nyour securities in the applicable supplement. If no depository is named, the\ndepository will be DTC. The Depository Trust Company The following is based on\ninformation made publicly available by DTC: Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, DTC will act as securities depository for the securities.\nThe securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the\nname of Cede & Co. (DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may be\nrequested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered security\ncertificate will be issued for each issue of the securities, each in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the issue, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the\naggregate principal amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will\nbe issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional\ncertificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of the\nissue. We may also issue one or more global securities that represent multiple\nseries of debt securities. DTC, the world\u0092s largest securities depository, is a\nlimited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \u0093banking\norganization\u0094 within the meaning of the New York 100\n\nBanking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \u0093clearing corporation\u0094\nwithin the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \u0093clearing\nagency\u0094 registered\nunder Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n\u0093Exchange Act\u0094). DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million\nissues of U.S. and\nnon-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market\ninstruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC\u0092s direct participants deposit with\nDTC. DTC also facilitates the\npost-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities\ntransactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry\ntransfers and pledges between direct participants\u0092 accounts. This eliminates the\nneed\nfor physical movement of securities certificates. Direct participants include both\nU.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations, and certain other\norganizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing\nCorporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities\nClearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of\nwhich are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its\nregulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such\nas both U.S. and non-U.S. securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear\nthrough or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly (\u0093indirect participants\u0094). The DTC rules applicable to\nits participants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can be found\nat www.dtcc.com. Information on that website is not included or incorporated by\nreference herein.\n\nPurchases of the securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct\nparticipants, which will receive a credit for the\nsecurities on DTC\u0092s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of\neach security (\u0093beneficial owner\u0094) is in turn to be recorded on the direct and\nindirect participants\u0092 records. Beneficial owners will not receive\nwritten confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners are, however,\nexpected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as\nwell as periodic statements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect\nparticipant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction.\nTransfers of ownership interests in the securities are to be accomplished by\nentries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of\nbeneficial\nowners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their\nownership interests in the securities, except in the event that use of the book-\nentry system for the securities is discontinued.\n\nTo facilitate subsequent transfers, all securities deposited by direct\nparticipants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC\u0092s\npartnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an\nauthorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their\nregistration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not\neffect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual\nbeneficial owners of the securities; DTC\u0092s records reflect only the identity of\nthe direct participants to whose accounts such securities are credited, which may\nor\nmay not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain\nresponsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.\n\nConveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by\ndirect participants to indirect participants, and by direct\nand indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements\namong them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in\neffect from time to time. Beneficial owners of securities may wish to take certain\nsteps to\naugment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to\nthe securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to\nthe security documents. For example, beneficial owners of securities may wish to\nascertain that the nominee holding the securities for its benefit has agreed to\nobtain and transmit notices to beneficial owners. In the alternative, beneficial\nowners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request\nthat\ncopies of notices be provided directly to them.\n\n101\n\nNeither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with\nrespect to securities unless authorized by a direct participant in accordance with\nDTC\u0092s Money Market Instrument (\u0093MMI\u0094) procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC\nmails an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record\ndate. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.\u0092s consenting or voting rights to those\ndirect participants to whose accounts the securities are credited on the record\ndate (identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy).\n\nDividend payments or any payments of principal, any premium, interest, or other\namounts on the securities will be made to Cede & Co.,\nor any other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.\nDTC\u0092s practice is to credit direct participants\u0092 accounts upon DTC\u0092s receipt of\nfunds and corresponding detail information from us, on the applicable\npayment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC\u0092s records.\nPayments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \u0093street name,\u0094 and will be\nthe responsibility of these participants and not of DTC or its nominee, us, the\ntrustee, or any other agent or party, subject to any statutory or regulatory\nrequirements that may be in effect from time to time. Payment of dividends or\nprincipal and any premium or interest to Cede & Co. (or any other nominee as may\nbe requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is our responsibility.\nDisbursement of the payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC,\nand disbursement of the payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of\nthe direct or indirect participants.\n\nWe will send any redemption notices to DTC. If less than all of the securities of\na series are being redeemed, DTC\u0092s practice is to\ndetermine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the\nissue to be redeemed.\n\nA beneficial owner shall give notice\nto elect to have its securities repurchased through the participant through which\nit holds its beneficial interest in the security to the applicable trustee or\ntender agent. The beneficial owner shall effect delivery of its securities by\ncausing the\ndirect participant to transfer its interest in the securities on DTC\u0092s records.\nThe requirement for physical delivery of securities in connection with an optional\ntender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights\nin the securities are transferred by the direct participant on DTC\u0092s records and\nfollowed by a book-entry credit of tendered securities to the applicable trustee\nor agent\u0092s DTC account.\n\nDTC may discontinue providing its services as depository for the securities at any\ntime by giving us reasonable notice. If this occurs, and if\na successor securities depository is not obtained, we will print and deliver\ndefinitive securities.\n\nWe may decide to discontinue use of\nthe system of book-entry only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities\ndepository). In that event, we will print and deliver definitive securities to\nDTC.\n\nThe information in this section concerning DTC and DTC\u0092s book-entry system has\nbeen obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable,\nbut we take no responsibility for its accuracy.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each hold securities for their customers and\nfacilitate the clearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions by electronic book-entry transfer between their respective account\nholders (each such account holder, a \u0093participant\u0094 and collectively, the\n\u0093participants\u0094). Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide various\nservices including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of\ninternationally traded securities and\n\n102\n\nsecurities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg also deal\nwith domestic securities markets in several countries through established\ndepository and custodial relationships.\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have established an electronic bridge\nbetween their two systems across which their respective participants may settle\ntrades with each other. Euroclear is incorporated under the laws of Belgium and\nClearstream,\nLuxembourg is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg customers are world-wide financial\ninstitutions, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, and clearing corporations. Indirect access to Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg is available to other institutions that clear through or\nmaintain a\ncustodial relationship with a participant of either system.\n\nThe address of Euroclear is Euroclear Bank SA/NV, 1 Boulevard du Roi Albert\nII, B-1210 Brussels and the address of Clearstream, Luxembourg is Clearstream\nBanking, 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may be depositories for a global security\nsold or traded outside the United States. In addition, if DTC\nis the depository for a global security, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may\nhold interests in the global security as participants in DTC. As long as any\nglobal security is held by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as depository, you\nmay\nhold an interest in the global security only through an organization that\nparticipates, directly or indirectly, in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. If\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is the depository for a global security and\nthere is no\ndepository in the United States, you will not be able to hold interests in that\nglobal security through any securities clearing system in the United States.\n\nPayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and other matters relating to\nthe securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg must comply with the rules and procedures of those clearing systems.\nThose clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We\nhave no control over those clearing systems or their participants, and we take no\nresponsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, on one hand, and participants in DTC, on the\nother hand, when DTC is the depository, also would be subject to DTC\u0092s rules and\nprocedures.\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream,\nLuxembourg payments, deliveries, transfers,\nexchanges, notices, and other transactions involving any securities held through\nthose clearing systems only on days when those clearing systems are open for\nbusiness. Those clearing systems may not be open for business on days when banks,\nbrokers,\nand other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition,\nbecause of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the\nsecurities through these clearing systems and wish to transfer their interests, or\nto\nreceive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to\ntheir interests, on a particular day may find that the transaction will not be\neffected until the next business day in Brussels or Luxembourg, as applicable.\nThus,\ninvestors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to\nact before the expiration date. In addition, investors who hold their interests\nthrough both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may need to make special\narrangements to finance any purchases or sales of their interests between the\nUnited States and European clearing systems, and those transactions may settle\nlater than would be the case for transactions within one clearing system.\n\nThe information in this section concerning Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\nhas been obtained from sources that we believe to be\nreliable, but we take no responsibility for its accuracy.\n\n103\n\nCDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.\n\nDebt securities that are denominated in Canadian dollars (\u0093Canadian notes\u0094) may be\nissued as one or more registered notes in global\nform (i.e., global notes), initially registered in the name of CDS & CO., as\nnominee for CDS, and deposited with CDS. Beneficial interests in the global notes\nwill be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting\non behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in CDS.\nInvestors may elect to hold interests in the global notes through any of CDS,\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg if they are participants of those systems, or\nindirectly\nthrough organizations which are participants in those systems. Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg will hold interests on behalf of their participants\nthrough customers\u0092 securities accounts in their respective names on the books of\ntheir\nrespective Canadian subcustodians (\u0093Canadian Subcustodians\u0094), which in turn will\nhold those interests in customers\u0092 securities accounts in the names of the\nCanadian Subcustodians on the books of CDS.\n\nThe global notes representing Canadian notes will be registered in the name of CDS\n& CO., as nominee of CDS, for the benefit of\nowners of beneficial interests in the global notes, including participants of\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Principal and interest payments on the\nglobal notes registered in the name of CDS & CO., or any other nominee appointed\nby\nCDS, will be made on our behalf to CDS & CO., or any other nominee appointed by\nCDS, and CDS will distribute the payments received to the applicable clearing\nsystem.\n\nFor as long as the Canadian notes are maintained in book-entry only form at CDS,\nwe and any paying agent will treat CDS & CO., or any\nother nominee appointed by CDS, as the sole holder of such Canadian notes for all\npurposes. Canadian notes which are represented by the global notes will be\ntransferable only in accordance with the rules and procedures of CDS.\n\nThe registered holder of the applicable global notes will be the only person\nentitled to receive payments in respect of the Canadian notes\nrepresented by those global notes, and we will be discharged by payment to, or to\nthe order of, the registered holder of those global notes for each amount so paid.\nEach of the persons shown in the records of CDS as the beneficial holder of a\nparticular nominal amount of notes represented by the global notes must look\nsolely to CDS for its share of each payment that we make to, or to the order of,\nthe registered holder of the global notes. No person other than the registered\nholder of\nthe global notes will have any claim against us in respect of any payments due on\nthe global notes.\n\nCDS is Canada\u0092s national\nsecurities clearing and depositary services organization. CDS participants include\nbanks (including the Canadian Subcustodians), investment dealers, and trust\ncompanies and may include certain of the underwriters for a particular offering of\nCanadian notes. Functioning as a service utility for the Canadian financial\ncommunity, CDS provides a variety of computer automated services for financial\ninstitutions and investment dealers active in domestic and international capital\nmarkets.\nIndirect access to CDS is available to other organizations that clear through, or\nmaintain a custodial relationship with, a CDS participant. Transfers of ownership\nand other interests, including cash distributions, in notes clearing and settling\nthrough CDS may only be processed through CDS participants and will be completed\nin accordance with existing CDS rules and procedures. CDS is headquartered in\nToronto and has offices in Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver. CDS is a subsidiary\nof The\nCanadian Depository for Securities Limited, part of TMX Group Limited. It is\naffiliated with CDS Inc., which provides services to the Canadian Securities\nAdministrators, and CDS Innovations Inc., a commercial marketer of CDS information\nproducts\nsuch as CDS Bulletins and entitlements information.\n\nThe information in this prospectus concerning CDS and CDS\u0092s book-entry system\nhas been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no\nresponsibility for the accuracy of this information. CDS may change or discontinue\nits procedures at any time.\n\n104\n\nSecondary market trading in Canadian notes between CDS participants will be in\naccordance with market conventions applicable to transactions in book-based\nCanadian domestic bonds. Secondary market trading in Canadian notes between\nEuroclear participants and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants will occur in the\nordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and will be settled using the procedures\napplicable to conventional Eurobonds. Links have been established among CDS,\nEuroclear, and Clearstream, Luxembourg to facilitate the initial issuance of\nCanadian notes and cross-market transfers of such Canadian notes associated with\nsecondary market trading. CDS will be linked to Euroclear and Clearstream,\nLuxembourg through the CDS accounts of the respective Canadian Subcustodians of\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Cross-market transfers of Canadian notes\nbetween persons holding directly or indirectly through CDS participants, on the\none hand, and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg\nparticipants, on the other, will be effected in CDS in accordance with CDS rules;\nhowever, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to\nthe relevant clearing system by the counterparty in that system in accordance with\nits rules and procedures and within its established deadlines. The relevant\nclearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements,\ndeliver instructions to CDS directly or through its Canadian Subcustodian to take\naction to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving the\nrelevant Canadian notes in CDS, and making or receiving payment in accordance with\nthe normal procedures for settlement in CDS. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\nparticipants may not deliver instructions directly to CDS or to the Canadian\nSubcustodians. Because of time-zone differences, credits of Canadian notes\nreceived in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as a result of a transaction with\na CDS participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing\nand dated the business day following the CDS settlement date. Those credits or any\ntransactions in Canadian notes settled during that processing will be reported to\nthe relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants on the\napplicable business day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as\na result of sales of Canadian notes by or through a Euroclear participant or a\nClearstream, Luxembourg participant to a CDS participant will be received with\nvalue on the CDS settlement date, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear\nor Clearstream, Luxembourg cash account only as of the business day following\nsettlement in CDS. Notices given to CDS, as registered holder of Canadian notes,\nwill be passed on to the beneficial owners of such Canadian notes in accordance\nwith the standard rules and procedures of CDS and its direct and indirect\nparticipants, including Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Special\nConsiderations for Global Securities As an indirect owner, an investor\u0092s rights\nrelating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the\ndepository and those of the investor\u0092s financial institution or other intermediary\nthrough which it holds its interest (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg,\nif DTC is the depository), as well as general laws relating to securities\ntransfers. We do not recognize this type of investor or any intermediary as a\nholder of securities. Instead, we deal only with the depository that holds the\nglobal security. If securities are issued only in the form of a global security,\nan investor should be aware of the following:\n                                                                                  \n      an investor cannot cause the securities to be registered in his or her own  \n      name, and cannot obtain physical                                            \n      certificates for his or her interest in the securities, except in the       \n      limited                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n105\n                                                      \n  circumstances described in the relevant securities  \n  or in the indenture, agreement or other instrument  \n  governing the relevant securities;

The following discussion is not exhaustive of all possible tax\nconsiderations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u0093Code\u0094), regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment (\u0093Treasury\u0094) (including proposed and temporary regulations), rulings,\ncurrent administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094), and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect\nand all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly\nwith retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert,\nor that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax\nconsequences described below. This section constitutes the opinion of Davis Polk &\nWardwell LLP, U.S. tax counsel to Bank of America Corporation. This summary is for\ngeneral information only, and does not purport to discuss all aspects of U.S.\nfederal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of\nits investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special tax rules,\nsuch as: partnerships, or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, subchapter S corporations, any government (or\ninstrumentality or agency thereof), banks, financial institutions, tax-\nexemptentities, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate\ninvestment trusts, trusts and estates, dealers in securities or currencies,\ntraders in securities that have elected to use the mark-to-marketmethod of tax\naccounting for their securities, persons holding the debt securities, preferred\nstock, depositary shares, or common stock as part of an integrated investment,\nincluding a \u0093straddle,\u0094 \u0093hedge,\u0094 \u0093constructive sale,\u0094 or \u0093conversion transaction,\u0094\npersons (other than Non-U.S.Holders) whose functional currency for tax purposes is\nnot the U.S. dollar, and persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions\nof the Code. This summary does not address special rules applicable to a person\nrequired for U.S. federal income tax purposes to conform the timing of income\naccruals with respect to the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares\nand common stock to its financial statements under Section 451(b) of the Code.\nThis summary also does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or\nlocal governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a\nparticular holder. This summary also may not apply to all forms of debt\nsecurities, preferred stock, depositary shares, or common stock that we may issue.\nThis discussion applies only to investors who, except as otherwise specifically\nnoted:\n                                                                                  \n      will purchase the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, or   \n      common stock offered in this prospectus                                     \n      upon original issuance; and                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      will hold such securities as capital assets within the meaning of Section\u00a0  \n      1221 of the Code, which generally                                           \n      means as property held for investment.                                      \n                                                                                  \nYou should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of these securities\n(including the consequences resulting from the Medicare tax on investment income),\nas well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local,\nnon-U.S.,or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S.\nfederal or other tax laws. As used in this prospectus, the term \u0093U.S. Holder\u0094\nmeans a beneficial owner of the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary\nshares, or common stock offered in this prospectus that is for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes:\n                                                              \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United States;  \n                                                              \n108\n                                                                                  \n      a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for U.S.        \n      federal income tax purposes) created or                                     \n      organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state of the  \n      United States or the District of Columbia; or                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income    \n      taxation regardless of its source.                                          \n                                                                                  \nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 is a beneficial owner that\nis not a U.S. Holder and is not a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes holds the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares,\nor common stock offered in this prospectus, the U.S. federal income tax treatment\nof a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership and accordingly, this summary does not apply to\npartnerships. A partner of a partnership holding the debt securities, preferred\nstock, depositary shares, or common stock should consult its own tax advisor\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the partner of the\nacquisition, ownership, and disposition by the partnership of the debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares, or common stock. This discussion is subject to\nany additional discussion regarding U.S. federal taxation contained in the\napplicable supplement. Accordingly, you should also consult the applicable\nsupplement for any additional discussion of U.S. federal taxation with respect to\nthe specific debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock\noffered thereunder. Taxation of Debt Securities This section describes the\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and\ndisposition of the debt securities offered in this prospectus, other than the debt\nsecurities described below under \u0093\u0097Convertible, Renewable, Extendible, Indexed,\nand Other Debt Securities,\u0094 which will be described in the applicable supplement.\nThis section is directed solely to holders that, except as otherwise specifically\nnoted, will purchase the debt securities offered in this prospectus upon original\nissuance for cash at the issue price, as defined below. Consequences to U.S.\nHolders The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences that will apply to U.S. Holders of debt securities. Payment of Stated\nInterest.Except as described below in the case of interest on a debt security\nissued with original issue discount, as defined below under \u0093\u0097Original Issue\nDiscount,\u0094 stated interest on a debt security generally will be included in the\nincome of a U.S. Holder as interest income at the time it is accrued or is\nreceived in accordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s regular method of accounting for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes (\u0093method of tax accounting\u0094) and will be ordinary\nincome. Original Issue Discount.Some of our debt securities may be issued with\noriginal issue discount (\u0093OID\u0094). U.S. Holders of debt securities issued with OID,\nother than short-term debt securities with a maturity of one year or less from its\ndate of issue (after taking into account the last possible date that the debt\nsecurity could be outstanding under its terms), will be subject to special tax\naccounting rules, as described in greater detail below. For tax purposes, OID is\nthe excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094 of a debt security over\nits \u0093issue price.\u0094 The \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094 of a debt security is\nthe sum of all payments required to be made on the debt security other than\n\u0093qualified stated interest\u0094 payments. The \u0093issue price\u0094 of a debt 109\n\nsecurity is generally the first offering price to the public at which a\nsubstantial amount of the issue was sold (ignoring sales to bond houses, brokers,\nor similar persons or organizations\nacting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers). Subject\nto any additional discussion in the applicable supplement and to the discussion\nbelow regarding reopenings, it is expected, and the discussion below assumes,\nthat,\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the issue price of a debt security is equal\nto its stated issue price indicated in the applicable supplement. The term\n\u0093qualified stated interest\u0094 generally means stated interest that is\nunconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the\nissuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a\nsingle fixed rate or, under certain circumstances, at a variable rate. Subject to\nthe\ndiscussion below under \u0093\u0097Debt Securities Subject to Early Redemption,\u0094 if a debt\nsecurity bears interest during any accrual period at a rate below the rate\napplicable for the remaining term of the debt security (for example, debt\nsecurities with teaser rates or interest holidays), interest payable at the lowest\nstated fixed rate generally is qualified stated interest and the excess, if any,\nis included in the stated redemption price at maturity for purposes of determining\nwhether the debt security will be issued with original issue discount.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security with a maturity of more than one\nyear from its date of issue that has been issued with OID (an \u0093OID debt security\u0094)\nis generally required to include any qualified stated interest payments in income\nas interest at the time such interest is accrued or is received in\naccordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s method of tax accounting, as described above\nunder \u0093\u0097Payment of Stated Interest.\u0094 A U.S. Holder of an OID debt security is\ngenerally required to include in income the sum of the daily accruals of\nthe OID for the debt security for each day during the taxable year (or portion of\nthe taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder held the OID debt security, regardless\nof such holder\u0092s method of tax accounting. Thus, a U.S. Holder may be required\nto include OID in income in advance of the receipt of some or all of the related\ncash payments. The daily portion is determined by allocating the OID for each day\nof the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual\nperiods\nmay even vary in length over the term of the OID debt security, provided that each\naccrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal\nor interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final\nday\nof an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to\nthe excess of: (1) the product of the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the OID debt\nsecurity at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity\n(computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each\naccrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period)\nover (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual\nperiod. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the\namount payable at maturity, other than a payment of qualified stated interest, and\nthe adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special\nrules\nwill apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The \u0093adjusted\nissue price\u0094 of an OID debt security at the beginning of any accrual period is the\nsum of the issue price of the OID debt security plus the amount of OID\nallocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the OID\ndebt security that were not qualified stated interest. Under these rules, a U.S.\nHolder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of\nOID\nin successive accrual periods.\n\nIf the excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094 of a debt security over\nits\n\u0093issue price\u0094 is less than 0.25% of its stated redemption price at maturity\nmultiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity, or\n\u0093weighted average maturity\u0094 in the case of debt securities with more\nthan one principal payment (\u0093de minimis OID\u0094), the debt security is not treated as\nissued with OID. The \u0093weighted average maturity\u0094 is the sum of the following\namounts determined for each payment under the debt security other\nthan a payment of qualified stated interest: (i) the number of complete years from\nthe issue date of the debt security until the payment is made, multiplied by (ii)\na fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the payment and the\ndenominator of which is the debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity. A\nU.S. Holder generally must include the de minimis OID in income at the time\npayments, other than qualified\n\n110\n\nstated interest, on the debt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid\n(unless the U.S. Holder makes the election described below under \u0093\u0097Election to\nTreat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount\u0094). Any amount of de minimis OID that is included in income\nin this manner will be treated as capital gain.\n\nTreasury regulations provide specific rules regarding whether additional debt\nsecurities issued in a reopening will be considered part of the\nsame issue, with the same issue price and yield to maturity, as the original debt\nsecurities to which they relate for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Except as\nprovided otherwise in an applicable supplement, we intend to treat additional debt\nsecurities issued by us in any reopening as part of the original issuance to which\nthey relate for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we therefore expect that the\namount of OID on such additional debt securities will generally be the same as\nthat\nof the original debt securities to which they relate. However, if the IRS were to\nsuccessfully challenge such treatment, the additional debt securities would not be\ntreated as part of the same issuance as the original debt securities and,\ntherefore,\nthe amount of OID on the additional debt securities could differ from that of the\noriginal debt securities to which such additional debt securities relate. In that\nevent, because persons responsible for information reporting with respect to the\ndebt\nsecurities may not be able to determine whether original debt securities or\nadditional debt securities are held by a particular holder, such persons may\nreport an amount of OID to the holders of the debt securities and the IRS that\nexceeds the\namount required to be included in the U.S. Holder\u0092s income. This may adversely\nimpact the trading price (if any) for the entire series of the debt securities.\nDepending on a U.S. Holder\u0092s purchase price, the additional debt securities may\nhave bond premium or market discount, in each case as discussed below under\n\u0093\u0097Amortizable Bond Premium\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Market Discount.\u0094\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Early Redemption. A debt security subject to redemption\nprior to maturity may be subject to rules that\ndiffer from the general rules described above for purposes of determining the\nyield and maturity of the debt security (which may affect whether the debt\nsecurity is treated as issued with OID and, if so, the timing of accrual of the\nOID). Under\napplicable Treasury regulations, we will generally be presumed to exercise an\nunconditional option to redeem a debt security if the exercise of the option will\nlower the yield on the debt security. Conversely, a U.S. Holder will generally be\npresumed to exercise an unconditional option to require us to repurchase a debt\nsecurity if the exercise of the option will increase the yield on the debt\nsecurity. In either case, if such an option is not in fact exercised, the debt\nsecurity will\nbe treated, solely for purposes of calculating OID, as if it were redeemed and a\nnew debt security were issued on the presumed exercise date for an amount equal to\nthe debt security\u0092s adjusted issue price on that date.\n\nUnder these rules, if a debt security provides for a fixed rate of interest that\nincreases over the term of the debt security, the debt\nsecurity\u0092s issue price is not below its stated principal amount and we have an\noption to redeem the debt security for an amount equal to the stated principal\namount (plus accrued interest, if any) on or prior to the first date on which an\nincreased rate of interest is in effect, the yield on the debt security will be\nlowered if we redeem the debt security before the initial increase in the interest\nrate, and therefore our redemption option will be treated as exercised. Since the\ndebt\nsecurity will therefore be treated as if it were redeemed and reissued prior to\nthe initial increase in the interest rate, the debt security will not be treated\nas issued with OID. If a debt security is not treated as issued with OID and if,\ncontrary to the presumption in the applicable Treasury regulations, we do not\nredeem the debt security before the initial increase in the interest rate, the\nsame analysis will apply to all subsequent increases in the interest rate. This\nmeans that\nthe debt security that is deemed reissued will be treated as redeemed prior to any\nsubsequent increase in the interest rate, and therefore as issued without OID. If\nthe actual remaining term of a debt security is one year or less at the time of a\ndeemed reissuance, it is possible that the deemed reissued debt security would be\ntreated as a short-term debt instrument. See \u0093\u0097Short-Term Debt Securities\u0094 below.\nWhile a debt security with a deemed remaining term of one year or less\nbased on the presumed exercise of an option should not be treated as a short-term\n\n111\n\ndebt instrument, the IRS or a court might treat the stated interest payable on the\ndebt security as OID instead of qualified stated interest during that deemed\nremaining term. U.S. Holders should\nconsult with their own tax advisors regarding this uncertainty.\n\nAdditional rules applicable to debt securities with OID that are\ndenominated in or determined by reference to a currency other than the U.S. dollar\nare described under \u0093\u0097Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\u0094 below.\n\nVariable Rate Debt Securities. In the case of a debt security that is a variable\nrate debt security, special rules apply. A debt\nsecurity will qualify as a \u0093variable rate debt instrument\u0094 under Treasury\nregulations if (i) the debt security\u0092s issue price does not exceed the total non-\ncontingent principal payments by\nmore than the lesser of: (a) 0.015 multiplied by the product of the total non-\ncontingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity from\nthe issue date, or (b) 15% of the total non-contingent principal payments; (ii)\nthe debt security provides for stated interest, compounded or paid at least\nannually, only at one or more qualified floating rates, a single fixed rate and\none or more\nqualified floating rates, a single objective rate, or a single fixed rate and a\nsingle objective rate that is a qualified inverse floating rate, each as defined\nin the applicable Treasury regulations; and (iii) certain other conditions, as set\nforth in the applicable Treasury regulations, are satisfied.\n\nGenerally, a rate is a qualified floating rate if: (i) (a) variations\nin the value of the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous\nvariations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the debt\nsecurity is denominated; or (b) the rate is equal to such a rate multiplied by\neither a fixed multiple that is greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35 or a\nfixed multiple greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35 increased or decreased by\na fixed rate, and (ii) the value of the rate on any date during the term of the\ndebt\nsecurity is set no earlier than three months prior to the first day on which that\nvalue is in effect and no later than one year following that first day. If a debt\nsecurity provides for two or more qualified floating rates that are within 0.25%\nof\neach other on the issue date or can reasonably be expected to have approximately\nthe same values throughout the term of the debt security, the qualified floating\nrates together constitute a single qualified floating rate. A debt security will\nnot\nhave a variable rate that is a qualified floating rate, however, if the variable\nrate of interest is subject to one or more minimum or maximum rate floors or\nceilings or one or more governors limiting the amount of increase or decrease\nunless such\nfloor, ceiling, or governor is fixed throughout the term of the debt security or\nis not reasonably expected as of the issue date to significantly affect the yield\non the debt security.\n\nGenerally, an objective rate is a rate (i) that is not a qualified floating rate,\n(ii) that is determined using a single fixed\nformula that is based on objective financial or economic information that is not\nwithin the control of the issuer or a related party, and (iii) the value of which\non any date during the term of the debt security is set no earlier than three\nmonths prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later than\none year following that first day. If it is reasonably expected that the average\nvalue of the variable rate during the first half of the term of a debt security\nwill be\neither significantly less than or significantly greater than the average value of\nthe rate during the final half of the term of the debt security, then the debt\nsecurity will not have a variable rate that is an objective rate. An objective\nrate is a\nqualified inverse floating rate if that rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a\nqualified floating rate and variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to\ninversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate.\n\nA debt security will also have a variable rate that is a single qualified floating\nrate or an objective rate if interest on the debt security\nis stated at a fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less followed by\neither a qualified floating rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period, and\nthe value of the qualified floating rate or objective rate is intended to\napproximate\nthe fixed rate (which is presumed if (a) the fixed rate and (b) the qualified\nfloating rate or objective rate have values on the issue date of the debt security\nthat do not differ by more than 0.25%).\n\n112\n\nIn the case of a debt security that provides for stated interest that is\nunconditionally\npayable at least annually at a variable rate that is a single qualified floating\nrate or objective rate, or one of those rates after a single fixed rate for an\ninitial period of one year or less (as described above), all stated interest on\nthe debt\nsecurity is treated as qualified stated interest. In that case, both the debt\nsecurity\u0092s yield to maturity and qualified stated interest will be determined,\nsolely for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, if any, as though the debt\nsecurity will bear interest in all periods throughout its term (in the case of a\nsingle qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate) at a fixed rate\ngenerally equal to the value of the rate on the issue date or, in the case of an\nobjective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate), the rate that\nreflects the yield to maturity that is reasonably expected for the debt security\n(the \u0093fixed rate substitute\u0094). A U.S. Holder should then recognize OID, if any,\nthat is calculated based on the debt security\u0092s assumed yield to maturity. If the\ninterest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds or is less than\nthe assumed fixed interest, the qualified stated interest allocable to that\nperiod is increased or decreased, as applicable.\n\nIf a debt security provides for stated interest at multiple floating rates, the\ninterest\nand OID accruals on the debt security must be determined by (i) determining a\nfixed rate substitute for each qualified floating rate or qualified inverse\nfloating rate provided under the debt security (as described above), (ii)\nconstructing the\nequivalent fixed rate debt instrument, using the fixed rate substitutes, (iii)\ndetermining the amount of qualified stated interest and OID with respect to the\nequivalent fixed rate debt instrument, and (iv) making appropriate adjustments\nto qualified stated interest or OID for actual variable rates during the\napplicable accrual period.\n\nIn the case of a debt security that\nprovides for stated interest either at one or more qualified floating rates or at\na qualified inverse floating rate and also provides for stated interest at a\nsingle fixed rate other than at a single fixed rate for an initial period (as\ndescribed\nabove), the interest and OID accruals on the debt security must be determined by\nusing the method described above. However, the debt security will be treated, for\npurposes of the first three steps of the determination, as if the debt security\nhad\nprovided for a qualified floating rate, or a qualified inverse floating rate,\nrather than the fixed rate. The qualified floating rate, or qualified inverse\nfloating rate, that replaces the fixed rate must be such that the fair market\nvalue of the\ndebt security as of the issue date approximates the fair market value of an\notherwise identical debt instrument that provides for the qualified floating rate,\nor qualified inverse floating rate, rather than the fixed rate.\n\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplement, it\nis expected that a fixed-rate reset note will\nqualify as a \u0093variable rate debt instrument\u0094 that provides for stated interest at\na single qualified floating rate in addition to a single fixed rate. Assuming that\nsuch treatment applies, a fixed-rate reset note will be subject to the\nrules described above in \u0093\u0097Variable Rate Debt Securities.\u0094\n\nAcquisition Premium.If a U.S. Holder purchases an OID\ndebt security for an amount greater than its adjusted issue price (as determined\nabove) at the purchase date and less than or equal to the sum of all amounts,\nother than qualified stated interest, payable on the OID debt security after the\npurchase\ndate, the excess is \u0093acquisition premium.\u0094 Under these rules, in general, the\namount of OID which must be included in income for the debt security for any\ntaxable year (or any portion of a taxable year in which the debt security is held)\nwill be reduced (but not below zero) by the portion of the acquisition premium\nallocated to the period. The amount of acquisition premium allocated to each\nperiod is determined by multiplying the OID that otherwise would have been\nincluded in income\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of the cost over the adjusted\nissue price of the OID debt security and the denominator of which is the excess of\nthe OID debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity over its adjusted\nissue price.\n\n113\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium.If a U.S. Holder purchases a debt security for an amount\nin\nexcess of the sum of all amounts payable on the debt security after the purchase\ndate, other than qualified stated interest, such U.S. Holder will be considered to\nhave purchased such debt security with \u0093amortizable bond premium\u0094 equal in\namount to such excess. A U.S. Holder may elect to amortize such premium as an\noffset to interest income using a constant yield method over the remaining term of\nthe debt security based on the U.S. Holder\u0092s yield to maturity with respect to the\ndebt security.\n\nA U.S. Holder generally may use the amortizable bond premium allocable to an\naccrual period to offset interest required to\nbe included in the U.S. Holder\u0092s income under its method of tax accounting with\nrespect to the debt security in that accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the amount of interest allocable to\nsuch\naccrual period, such excess would be allowed as a deduction for such accrual\nperiod, but only to the extent of the U.S. Holder\u0092s prior interest inclusions on\nthe debt security that have not been offset previously by bond premium. Any excess\nis\ngenerally carried forward and allocable to the next accrual period.\n\nIf a debt security may be redeemed by us prior to its maturity date,\nthe amount of amortizable bond premium will be based on the amount payable at the\napplicable redemption date, but only if use of the redemption date (in lieu of the\nstated maturity date) results in a smaller amortizable bond premium for the period\nending on the redemption date.\n\nAn election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations held\nby the U.S. Holder at\nthe beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and\nthereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and may be revoked only with the consent of\nthe IRS. Generally, a U.S. Holder may make an election to include in income its\nentire\nreturn on a debt security (i.e., the excess of all remaining payments to be\nreceived on the debt security over the amount paid for the debt security by such\nU.S. Holder) in accordance with a constant yield method based on the compounding\nof\ninterest, as discussed below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All Interest as Original\nIssue Discount.\u0094 If a U.S. Holder makes such an election for a debt security with\namortizable bond premium, such election will result in a deemed election\nto amortize bond premium for all of the U.S. Holder\u0092s debt instruments with\namortizable bond premium and may be revoked only with the permission of the IRS.\n\nA U.S. Holder that elects to amortize bond premium will be required to reduce its\ntax basis in the debt security by the amount of the premium\namortized during its holding period. OID debt securities purchased at a premium\nwill not be subject to the OID rules described above. If a U.S. Holder does not\nelect to amortize bond premium, the amount of bond premium will be included in its\ntax\nbasis in the debt security. Therefore, if a U.S. Holder does not elect to amortize\nbond premium and it holds the debt security to maturity, the premium generally\nwill be treated as capital loss when the debt security matures.\n\nMarket Discount.If a U.S. Holder purchases a debt security for an amount that is\nless than its stated redemption price at maturity,\nor, in the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted issue price, such U.S.\nHolder will be considered to have purchased the debt security with \u0093market\ndiscount.\u0094 Any payment, other than qualified stated interest, or any gain upon a\nsale,\nexchange, retirement or other taxable disposition (each, a \u0093taxable disposition\u0094)\nof a debt security with market discount generally will be treated as ordinary\nincome to the extent of the market discount not previously included in income\nthat accrued on the debt security during such U.S. Holder\u0092s holding period. In\ngeneral, market discount is treated as accruing on a straight-line basis over the\nterm of the debt security unless an election is made to accrue the market discount\nunder a constant yield method. In addition, a U.S. Holder may be required to\ndefer, until the maturity of the debt security\n\n114\n\nor its earlier taxable disposition, the deduction of a portion of the interest\npaid on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the debt\nsecurity in an amount not exceeding\nthe accrued market discount on the debt security.\n\nA U.S. Holder may elect to include market discount in income currently as it\naccrues\n(on either a straight-line or constant yield basis), in lieu of treating a portion\nof any gain realized upon a taxable disposition of the debt security as ordinary\nincome. If an election is made to include market discount on a current basis, the\ninterest deduction deferral rule described above will not apply. If a U.S. Holder\nmakes such an election, it will apply to all market discount debt instruments\nacquired by such U.S. Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year\nto which\nthe election applies. The election may not be revoked without the consent of the\nIRS. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors before making this\nelection.\n\nIf the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity of a debt\nsecurity or, in the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted\nissue price, and the amount paid for the debt security is less than 0.25% of its\nstated redemption price at maturity or, in the case of an OID debt security, its\nadjusted issue price, multiplied by the number of remaining complete years to the\ndebt\nsecurity\u0092s maturity (\u0093de minimis market discount\u0094), the U.S. Holder is not treated\nas acquiring the debt security at a market discount.\n\nGenerally, a U.S. Holder may make an election to include in income its entire\nreturn on a debt security (i.e., the excess of all remaining\npayments to be received on the debt security over the amount paid for the debt\nsecurity by such U.S. Holder) in accordance with a constant yield method based on\nthe compounding of interest, as discussed below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All\nInterest as Original Issue Discount.\u0094 If a U.S. Holder makes such an election for\na debt security with market discount, the U.S. Holder will be required to include\nmarket discount in income currently as it accrues on a constant yield basis for\nall market discount debt instruments acquired by such U.S. Holder on or after the\nfirst day of the first taxable year to which the election applies, and such\nelection may be revoked only with the permission of the IRS.\n\nElection to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount.A U.S. Holder may elect\nto include in income all interest that accrues on a\ndebt security using the constant-yield method applicable to OID described above,\nsubject to certain limitations and exceptions. For purposes of this election,\ninterest includes stated interest, acquisition discount, OID, de minimis OID,\nmarket\ndiscount, de minimis market discount, and unstated interest, as adjusted by any\namortizable bond premium or acquisition premium, each as described herein. If this\nelection is made for a debt security, then, to apply the constant-yield method:\n(i) the issue price of the debt security will equal its cost, (ii) the issue date\nof the debt security will be the date it was acquired, and (iii) no payments on\nthe debt security will be treated as payments of qualified stated\ninterest. A U.S. Holder must make this election for the taxable year in which the\ndebt security was acquired, and may not revoke the election without the consent of\nthe IRS. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors before making\nthis\nelection.\n\nDebt Securities That Trade \u0093Flat.\u0094We expect that certain debt securities will\ntrade in the secondary\nmarket with accrued interest. However, we may issue debt securities with terms and\nconditions that would make it likely that such debt securities would trade \u0093flat\u0094\nin the secondary market, which means that upon a sale of a debt security a\nU.S. Holder would not be paid a separate amount that reflects the accrued but\nunpaid interest with respect to such debt security. Nevertheless, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, a portion of the sales proceeds equal to the interest accrued\nwith\nrespect to such debt security from the last interest payment date to the sale date\nmust be treated as interest income rather than as an amount realized upon the\nsale. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder that sells such a debt security between interest\npayment dates would be\n\n115\n\nrequired to recognize interest income and, in certain circumstances, would\nrecognize a capital loss (the deductibility of which is subject to limitations) on\nthe sale of the debt security.\nConcurrently, a U.S. Holder that purchases such a debt security between interest\npayment dates would not be required to include in income that portion of any\ninterest payment received that is attributable to interest that accrued prior to\nthe\npurchase. Such payment is generally treated as a return of capital which reduces\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s remaining cost basis in the debt security. However, interest\nthat accrues after the purchase date is included in income in the year received or\naccrued (depending on the U.S. Holder\u0092s method of tax accounting). U.S. Holders\nthat purchase such debt securities between interest payment dates should consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning such U.S. Holders\u0092 adjusted tax basis in the\ndebt security and whether such debt securities should be treated as having been\npurchased with market discount, as described above.\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities. Some of our debt securities may be issued with\nmaturities of one year or less from the date of issue (after\ntaking into account the last possible date that the debt security could be\noutstanding under its terms), which we refer to as short-term debt securities.\nTreasury regulations provide that no payments of interest on a short-term debt\nsecurity are\ntreated as qualified stated interest. Accordingly, in determining the amount of\ndiscount on a short-term debt security, all interest payments, including stated\ninterest, are included in the short-term debt security\u0092s stated redemption price\nat\nmaturity.\n\nIn general, U.S. Holders using the cash method of tax accounting will not be\nrequired to include accrued discount on short-term\ndebt securities in income currently unless they elect to do so, but will be\nrequired to include any stated interest in income as the interest is received,\nexcept to the extent already included under such election. However, a cash method\nU.S. Holder\nwill be required to treat any gain realized upon a taxable disposition of the\nshort-term debt security as ordinary income to the extent such gain does not\nexceed the discount accrued with respect to the short-term debt security, which\nwill be\ndetermined on a straight-line basis unless the U.S. Holder makes an election to\naccrue the discount under the constant-yield method, through the date of the\ntaxable disposition. Any gain in excess of this amount will be treated as short-\nterm capital\ngain. Any loss recognized will be treated as a capital loss. In addition, a cash\nmethod U.S. Holder that does not elect to include accrued discount in income\ncurrently will not be allowed to deduct any of the interest paid or accrued on any\nindebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry a short-term debt\nsecurity (in an amount not exceeding the deferred income), but instead will be\nrequired to defer deductions for such interest until the deferred income is\nrealized upon the\nmaturity of the short-term debt security or its earlier disposition in a taxable\ntransaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a cash method U.S. Holder of a short-\nterm debt security may elect to include accrued discount in income on a current\nbasis.\nIf this election is made, the limitation on the deductibility of interest\ndescribed above will not apply.\n\nA U.S. Holder using the accrual\nmethod of tax accounting generally will be required to include accrued discount on\na short-term debt security in income on a current basis, on either a straight-line\nbasis or, at the election of the U.S. Holder, under the constant-yield method\nbased\non daily compounding.\n\nRegardless of whether a U.S. Holder is a cash or accrual method holder, it may\nelect to include accrued acquisition\ndiscount with respect to a short-term debt security in income on a current basis.\n\u0093Acquisition discount\u0094 is the excess of the remaining redemption amount of the\nshort-term debt security at the time of acquisition over the purchase price.\nAcquisition discount will be treated as accruing on a straight-line basis or, at\nthe election of the U.S. Holder, under a constant yield method based on daily\ncompounding. If a U.S. Holder elects to include accrued acquisition discount in\nincome,\nthe rules for including OID will not apply. In addition, the market discount rules\ndescribed above will not apply to short-term debt securities.\n\n116\n\nSale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition. Upon a taxable\ndisposition\nof a debt security, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount realized upon the taxable disposition (less an\namount equal to any accrued interest not previously included in income if the debt\nsecurity is\ndisposed of between interest payment dates, which will be included in income as\ninterest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis in the debt security. The amount realized by the U.S. Holder\nwill\ninclude the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other property\nreceived for the debt security. A U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in a debt\nsecurity generally will be the cost of the debt security to such U.S. Holder,\nincreased\nby any OID, market discount, de minimis OID, de minimis market discount, or any\ndiscount with respect to a short-term debt security previously included in income\nwith respect to the debt security, and decreased by the amount of any premium\npreviously amortized to reduce interest on the debt security and the amount of any\npayment (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) received in respect of\nthe debt security.\n\nExcept as discussed above with respect to market discount, or as described below\nwith respect to debt securities subject to contingencies and Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities, gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of a\ndebt security generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if the debt security\nhas been held for more than one year. Net long-term capital gain recognized by an\nindividual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. The ability of\nU.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code. If\na\nU.S. Holder recognizes a loss above certain thresholds, the U.S. Holder may be\nrequired to file a Form 8886 with the IRS, as discussed under \u0093Reportable\nTransactions\u0094 below.\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Contingencies. Certain of the debt securities may\nprovide for an alternative payment schedule or schedules\napplicable upon the occurrence of a contingency or contingencies, other than a\nremote or incidental contingency, whether such contingency relates to payments of\ninterest or of principal. In addition, subject to the discussion above under\n\u0093\u0097Debt Securities Subject to Early Redemption,\u0094 certain of the debt securities may\ncontain provisions permitting them to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity\nat our option and/or at the option of the holder. Debt securities\ncontaining these features may be characterized as \u0093contingent payment debt\ninstruments\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf the debt securities are properly characterized as contingent payment debt\ninstruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such debt\nsecurities generally will be subject to Treasury regulations governing contingent\npayment debt instruments. Under those regulations, a U.S. Holder will be required\nto report OID based on a \u0093comparable yield\u0094 and a \u0093projected payment\nschedule,\u0094 both as described below, established by us for determining interest\naccruals and adjustments with respect to the debt security. The \u0093comparable yield\u0094\nand \u0093projected payment schedule,\u0094 which will generally be included in the\napplicable pricing supplement, are not used for any purpose other than to\ndetermine interest accruals and adjustments thereto in respect of the debt\nsecurities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. They do not constitute a\nprojection or representation by us regarding the actual amounts that will be paid\non the debt securities. A U.S. Holder that does not use the \u0093comparable yield\u0094 and\nfollow the \u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 to calculate its OID on a debt\nsecurity must timely disclose and justify the use of other estimates to the IRS.\nNo payments on a contingent payment debt instrument are treated as qualified\nstated interest.\n\nA \u0093comparable yield\u0094 with respect to a debt security generally is the yield at\nwhich we could issue a fixed-rate debt instrument\nwith terms similar to those of the debt security (taking into account for this\npurpose the level of subordination, term, timing of payments, and general market\nconditions, but ignoring any adjustments for liquidity or the riskiness of the\ncontingencies with respect to the debt security). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\ncomparable yield must not be less than the applicable U.S. federal rate based on\nthe overall maturity of the debt security.\n\n117\n\nA \u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 with respect to a debt security generally is a\nseries of projected payments, the amount and timing of which would produce a yield\nto maturity on that debt security equal to the comparable yield. This projected\npayment schedule will consist of a projection for tax purposes of each non-\ncontingent and contingent payment.\n\nBased on the comparable yield and the projected payment schedule\nof the debt securities, a U.S. Holder of a debt security (regardless of its method\nof tax accounting) generally will be required to accrue as OID the sum of the\ndaily portions of interest on the debt security for each day in the taxable year\non\nwhich the U.S. Holder held the debt security, adjusted upward or downward to\nreflect the difference, if any, between the actual and projected amount of any\ncontingent payments on the debt security, as set forth below. The daily portions\nof interest\nfor a debt security are determined by allocating to each day in an accrual period\nthe ratable portion of interest on the debt security that accrues in the accrual\nperiod. The amount of interest on the debt security that accrues in an accrual\nperiod\nis the product of the comparable yield on the debt security (adjusted to reflect\nthe length of the accrual period) and the adjusted issue price of the debt\nsecurity at the beginning of the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a\ndebt security\nat the beginning of the first accrual period will equal its issue price (as\ndescribed above). For any subsequent accrual period, the adjusted issue price will\nbe (i) the sum of the issue price of the debt security and any interest previously\naccrued on the debt security by the U.S. Holder (without regard to any positive or\nnegative adjustments, described below) minus (ii) the amount of any projected\npayments on the debt security for previous accrual periods.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security generally will be required to include in income\nOID in excess of actual cash payments received for certain\ntaxable years. In addition to the accrued OID, a U.S. Holder will be required to\nrecognize interest income equal to the amount of any positive adjustment for a\ndebt security for the taxable year in which a contingent payment is paid\n(including a\npayment of interest at maturity). A positive adjustment is the excess of actual\npayments in respect of contingent payments over the projected amount of contingent\npayments. A U.S. Holder also will be required to account for any \u0093negative\nadjustment\u0094 for a taxable year in which a contingent payment is paid. A negative\nadjustment is the excess of the projected amounts of contingent payments over\nactual payments in respect of the contingent payments. A net negative adjustment\nis\nthe amount by which total negative adjustments in a taxable year exceed total\npositive adjustments in such taxable year. A net negative adjustment (i) will\nfirst reduce the amount of interest for the debt security that a U.S. Holder would\notherwise be required to include in income in the taxable year, and (ii) to the\nextent of any excess, will result in an ordinary loss equal to that portion of the\nexcess as does not exceed the excess of (a) the amount of all previous\ninterest inclusions under the debt security over (b) the total amount of the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s net negative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt security in\nprior taxable years. A net negative adjustment is not treated as a\nmiscellaneous itemized deduction under Section 67 of the Code (for which a\ndeduction would be unavailable or, beginning in 2026, available only to a limited\nextent). Any net negative adjustment in excess of the amounts described above in\n(i) and (ii) will be carried forward to offset future interest income on the debt\nsecurity or to reduce the amount realized upon a taxable disposition of the debt\nsecurity.\n\nIf a contingent payment becomes fixed (within the meaning of applicable Treasury\nregulations) more than six months before its due date, a\npositive or negative adjustment, as appropriate, is made to reflect the difference\nbetween the present value of the amount that is fixed and the present value of the\nprojected amount. The present value of each amount is determined by discounting\nthe\namount from the date the payment is due to the date the payment becomes fixed,\nusing a discount rate equal to the comparable yield. If all remaining scheduled\ncontingent payments on the debt security become fixed substantially\ncontemporaneously,\napplicable Treasury regulations provide that, with regard to contingent payments\nthat become fixed on a day that is more than six months before their due date,\nU.S. Holders should take into account positive or negative adjustments in\n\n118\n\nrespect of such contingent payments over the period to which they relate in a\nreasonable manner. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment (including an\namount payable at maturity) will\nbe treated as fixed if (and when) all remaining contingencies with respect to it\nare remote or incidental within the meaning of the applicable Treasury\nregulations. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the debt security and the character of\nany gain or\nloss on the sale of the debt security will also be affected. U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors concerning the application of these special rules,\nincluding as to what would be a \u0093reasonable manner\u0094 in their particular\nsituation.\n\nUpon a taxable disposition of a debt security prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder\ngenerally will recognize taxable gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the amount realized upon the taxable disposition\nand that U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the debt security. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis\nin a debt security generally will equal the cost of that debt security,\nincreased by the amount of OID previously accrued by the U.S. Holder for that debt\nsecurity (without regard to any positive or negative adjustments) and reduced by\nany projected payments for previous periods on the debt securities. A U.S. Holder\ngenerally will treat any gain as interest income and will treat any loss as\nordinary loss to the extent of the excess of previous interest inclusions over the\ntotal negative adjustments previously taken into account as ordinary losses, and\nthe\nbalance as long-term or short-term capital loss depending upon the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nholding period for the debt security. The deductibility of capital losses by a\nU.S. Holder is subject to limitations. If the U.S. Holder recognizes a loss above\ncertain thresholds, the U.S. Holder may be required to file a Form 8886 with the\nIRS, as discussed under \u0093Reportable Transactions\u0094 below.\n\nU.S. Holders considering the purchase of debt securities with these features\nshould carefully examine the applicable supplement and should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nto a U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such debt\nsecurities.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities.Additional considerations apply to a\nU.S. Holder\nof a debt security payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars (\u0093foreign\ncurrency\u0094).\n\nWe refer to these securities as Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities. In\nthe case of payments of stated interest, U.S. Holders using the cash method of tax\naccounting will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the\nforeign currency payment on a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security (other\nthan OID or market discount) when the payment of interest is received. The U.S.\ndollar value of the foreign currency payment is\ndetermined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such\nforeign currency on the date the payment is received, regardless of whether the\npayment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. dollar value\nwill\nbe the U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the foreign currency received. The U.S. Holder\nwill not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the\nreceipt of such payment.\n\nU.S. Holders using the accrual method of tax accounting will be required to\ninclude in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest\nincome that has accrued and is otherwise required to be taken into account with\nrespect to a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security during an accrual period.\nThe U.S. dollar value of the accrued income will\nbe determined by translating the income at the average rate of exchange for the\naccrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years,\nat the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year. A U.S. Holder\nmay\nelect, however, to translate the accrued interest income using the exchange rate\non the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that\nspans two taxable years, using the exchange rate on the last day of the taxable\nyear.\nIf the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of\nreceipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate the interest using\nthe exchange rate on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to all\nother\ndebt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and the election may not be changed\nwithout\n\n119\n\nthe consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors before\nmaking the above election. Upon receipt of an interest payment (including, upon\nthe sale of the debt security,\nthe receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest\npreviously included in income), the U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar\nvalue\nof such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the\nspot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received) and the\nU.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in income with\nrespect to\nsuch payment. This gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss.\n\nOID on a debt security that is also a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security\nwill be determined for any accrual period in the applicable foreign currency and\nthen translated into U.S. dollars, in the same manner as interest income accrued\nby a U.S.\nHolder on the accrual basis, as described above (regardless of such U.S. Holder\u0092s\nmethod of tax accounting). A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange\ngain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of such debt security,\nthe receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to OID previously\nincluded in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value\nof such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the\nspot rate\nfor such foreign currency on the date such payment is received) and the U.S.\ndollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued\ninterest). For these purposes, all receipts on a debt security will be viewed: (i)\nfirst,\nas the receipt of any stated interest payment called for under the terms of the\ndebt security, (ii) second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent\nthereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first,\nand\n(iii) third, as the receipt of principal.\n\nThe amount of market discount on Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities includible in income generally will be determined by\ntranslating the market discount determined in the foreign currency into U.S.\ndollars at the spot rate on the date the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security is retired or otherwise disposed of. If a U.S.\nHolder elected to accrue market discount currently, then the amount which accrues\nis determined in the foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars on the\nbasis of the average exchange rate in effect during such accrual period. A U.S.\nHolder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to\nmarket discount which is accrued currently using the approach applicable to the\naccrual of\ninterest income as described above.\n\nAmortizable bond premium on a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated\nDebt Security will be computed in the applicable foreign currency. If a U.S.\nHolder elected to amortize the premium, the amortizable bond premium will reduce\ninterest income in the applicable foreign currency. At the time bond premium is\namortized,\nforeign currency exchange gain or loss will be realized based on the difference\nbetween spot rates at such time and the time of acquisition of the Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security. If a U.S. Holder\ndoes not elect to amortize bond premium, the bond premium computed in the foreign\ncurrency must be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the maturity\ndate and such bond premium will constitute a capital loss which may be offset or\neliminated by foreign currency exchange gain.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder purchases a Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security with previously owned foreign currency, foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss (which will be treated as ordinary income or loss) will be\nrecognized in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the tax basis in\nthe\nforeign currency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of the foreign currency\nused to purchase the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security, determined on the\ndate of purchase.\n\nUpon a taxable disposition of a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security, a U.S.\nHolder will\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon\nthe taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest\nnot previously included in income, which will be treated as a payment of interest\nfor\nU.S. federal income tax purposes) and\n\n120\n\nthe adjusted tax basis in the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security. The\nadjusted tax basis in a Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security will equal the amount paid for the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security, increased by the amounts of any market discount\nor OID previously included in income with respect\nto the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security and reduced by any amortized\npremium and any principal payments received in respect of the Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated\nDebt Security. The amount of any payment in or adjustments measured by foreign\ncurrency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the\ndate of the purchase or adjustment. The amount realized will be based on the U.S.\ndollar\nvalue of the foreign currency on the date the payment is received or the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security is disposed of (or deemed disposed of as a result\nof a material change in the terms of the\ndebt security). If, however, a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security is traded\non an established securities market and the U.S. Holder uses the cash method of\ntax accounting, the U.S. dollar value of the\ntax basis and amount realized will be determined by translating the foreign\ncurrency payment at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the\npurchase or sale. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting may\nelect the same\ntreatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated\nDebt Securities traded on an established securities market, provided that the\nelection is applied consistently. This election\ncannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.\n\nExcept with respect to market discount as discussed above, and the foreign\ncurrency\nrules discussed below, gain or loss recognized upon a taxable disposition of a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be capital gain or loss and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if at the time\nof the taxable disposition the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security has been\nheld for more than one year. Net long-term capital gain recognized by an\nindividual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at\npreferential rates. The ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is\nsubject to limitations under the Code. If a U.S. Holder recognizes a loss above\ncertain thresholds, the U.S. Holder may be required to file a disclosure statement\nwith the\nIRS, as discussed under \u0093Reportable Transactions\u0094 below.\n\nA portion of the gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of\na Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security may be treated as foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as\nordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the\nprincipal amount of the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security is the purchase\nprice for the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security calculated in the foreign\ncurrency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss\nrecognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the\nprincipal amount determined on the date of the taxable disposition of the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal\namount determined on the date the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security was\npurchased. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be limited to\nthe amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security.\n\nThe tax basis in foreign currency received as interest on a Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security\nwill be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency determined at the spot rate\nin effect on the date the foreign currency is received. The tax basis in foreign\ncurrency received upon a taxable disposition of a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be equal to the U.S. dollar value\nof the foreign currency, determined at the time of the taxable disposition. As\ndiscussed above, if the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities are traded on\nan established securities market, a cash method U.S. Holder (or, upon election, an\naccrual method U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the\nforeign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of\nexchange on the settlement date of the taxable disposition. Accordingly, in such\ncase, no foreign currency exchange gain or loss will result from currency\nfluctuations\nbetween the trade date and settlement date of a taxable disposition. Any gain or\nloss recognized upon a taxable disposition of\n\n121\n\nforeign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its use to purchase\ndebt securities) will be ordinary income or loss. Special rules may apply to\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities that are also treated as contingent\npayment debt instruments. For the special treatment, if any, of Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities that are also contingent payment debt securities, see\nthe applicable supplement. Consequences to Non-U.S.Holders The following is a\nsummary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to\nNon-U.S.Holders of debt securities. Non-U.S.Holders should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the U.S. and non-U.S.tax considerations of acquiring, holding,\nand disposing of debt securities. Payments of Interest.Subject to the discussions\nbelow concerning backup withholding and FATCA, principal (and premium, if any) and\ninterest payments, including any OID, that are received from us or our agent and\nthat are not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S.Holder of a\ntrade or business within the United States, or a permanent establishment\nmaintained in the United States if certain tax treaties apply, generally will not\nbe subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax except as provided below.\nInterest, including any OID, may be subject to a 30% withholding tax (or less\nunder an applicable treaty, if any) if:\n                                                                                 \n      a Non-U.S. Holder actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the       \n      total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a \u0093controlled foreign corporation\u0094 for                   \n      U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related to us (directly or         \n      indirectly) through stock ownership;                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                              \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a bank extending credit under a loan agreement in  \n      the ordinary course of its trade or business;                           \n                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n      the interest payments on the debt security are determined by reference to   \n      the income, profits, changes in the                                         \n      value of property or other attributes of the debtor or a related party      \n      (other than payments that are based on the value of a security or index of  \n      securities that are, and will continue to be, actively traded within the    \n      meaning of                                                                  \n      Section\u00a01092(d) of the Code, and that are not nor will be a \u0093United States   \n      real property interest\u0094 as described in Section\u00a0897(c)(1) or 897(g) of the   \n      Code); or                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                           \n      the Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the certification requirements  \n      described below.                                                     \n                                                                           \nA Non-U.S.Holder generally will satisfy the certification requirements if either:\n(A) the Non-U.S.Holder certifies to the applicable withholding agent, under\npenalties of perjury, that it is a non-U.S.person and provides its name and\naddress (which certification may generally be made on an IRS Form W-8BENor\nW-8BEN-E,or a successor form), or (B) a securities clearing organization, bank, or\nother financial institution that holds customer securities in the ordinary course\nof its trade or business (a \u0093financial institution\u0094) and holds the debt security\ncertifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that\neither it or another financial institution has received the required statement\nfrom the Non-U.S.Holder certifying that it is a non-U.S.person and furnishes us\nwith a copy of the statement. 122\n\nPayments not meeting the requirements set forth above and thus subject to\nwithholding of\nU.S. federal income tax may nevertheless be exempt from withholding (or subject to\nwithholding at a reduced rate) if the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable\nwithholding agent with a properly executed IRS\nForm W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from, or\nreduction in, withholding under the benefit of a tax\ntreaty, or IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid\non the debt securities is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or\nbusiness within the United States as discussed below. To claim benefits under an\nincome tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a taxpayer identification number\nand certify as to its eligibility under the\nappropriate treaty\u0092s limitations on benefits article. In addition, special rules\nmay apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S. Holders that are entities\nrather than individuals. A Non-U.S. Holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of\nU.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund\nof any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with\nthe IRS.\n\nSale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition.A Non-U.S. Holder\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any\ncapital gain or market discount realized upon a taxable disposition of debt\nsecurities, provided that: (a) the gain is not effectively connected with the\nconduct of\na trade or business within the United States, or a permanent establishment\nmaintained in the United States if certain tax treaties apply, (b) in the case of\na Non-U.S. Holder that is an individual, the Non-U.S. Holder is not present in the\nUnited States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the taxable disposition\nof the debt security, and (c) the Non-U.S. Holder\nis not subject to tax pursuant to certain provisions of U.S. federal income tax\nlaw applicable to certain expatriates. An individual Non-U.S. Holder who is\npresent in the United States for 183 days or more in\nthe taxable year of the taxable disposition of a debt security, provided that\ncertain other conditions are met, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a\nrate of 30% on the gain realized upon the taxable disposition of such debt\nsecurity.\n\nIncome Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business within the United States. If\na Non-U.S.\nHolder of a debt security is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within\nthe United States and if interest (including any OID) on the debt security, or\ngain realized upon a taxable disposition of the debt security, is effectively\nconnected\nwith the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is\nattributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the\nUnited States), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding\ntax (provided that the certification requirements discussed above are satisfied),\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such interest\n(including any OID) or gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were\na U.S. Holder. Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading\n\u0093\u0097Consequences to U.S. Holders\u0094 for\na description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning,\nand disposing of debt securities. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, it may also be subject to a branch\nprofits tax equal to 30% (or lower rate under an applicable treaty, if any) of a\nportion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively\nconnected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States, subject to\ncertain\nadjustments.\n\nConvertible, Renewable, Extendible, Indexed, and Other Debt Securities\n\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to certain other debt\nsecurities, including contingent\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities, debt securities that may be\nconvertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common or preferred stock\nor other securities or debt or equity securities of\none or more third parties, debt securities the payments on which are determined or\npartially determined by reference to any index and other debt securities that are\nsubject to the rules governing contingent payment obligations, any renewable and\nextendible debt securities and any debt securities providing for the periodic\npayment of principal over the life of the\n\n123\n\ndebt security. The material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to\nthese debt securities will be discussed in the applicable supplement.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than certain exempt holders, we\nand other payors are required to report to the IRS all\npayments of principal, any premium, and interest on the debt security, and the\naccrual of OID on an OID debt security. In addition, we and other payors generally\nare required to report to the IRS any payment of proceeds of the sale of a debt\nsecurity before maturity. Additionally, backup withholding generally will apply to\nany payments, including payments of OID, if a U.S. Holder fails to provide an\naccurate taxpayer identification number and certify that the taxpayer\nidentification\nnumber is correct, the U.S. Holder is notified by the IRS that it has failed to\nreport all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income\ntax returns or a U.S. Holder does not certify that it has not underreported its\ninterest and dividend income.\n\nIn the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, backup withholding and\ninformation reporting will not apply to payments made if the Non-U.S. Holder\nprovides the required certification that it is not a U.S. person, or the Non-U.S.\nHolder\notherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the payor or withholding agent\ndoes not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person,\nor that the conditions of any exemption are not satisfied. However, we and other\npayors are required to report payments of interest on the debt securities on IRS\nForm 1042-S even if the payments are not otherwise subject to information\nreporting requirements.\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a\nrefund or a credit against a holder\u0092s U.S. federal income\ntax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nTaxation of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and Depositary Shares\n\nThis section describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nacquisition, ownership and\ndisposition of the common stock, preferred stock and depositary shares offered in\nthis prospectus.\n\nTaxation of Holders of Depositary Shares\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of depositary shares generally will\nbe treated as if they were\nthe holders of the preferred stock represented by such depositary shares.\nAccordingly, such holders will be entitled to take into account, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, income, and deductions to which they would be entitled if\nthey were\nholders of such preferred stock, as described more fully below. Exchanges of\npreferred stock for depositary shares and depositary shares for preferred stock\ngenerally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation.\n\nConsequences to U.S. Holders\n\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat will apply to U.S. Holders of our common stock, preferred\nstock, and depositary shares.\n\nDistributions on Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and Depositary\nShares.Distributions made to U.S.\nHolders out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder\nas dividend income and will be subject to tax as ordinary income. Dividends\nreceived\nby a non-corporate U.S. Holder that\n\n124\n\nconstitute \u0093qualified dividend income\u0094 are generally subject to tax at a maximum\nrate applicable to net long-term capital gains, provided that certain holding\nperiod and other requirements are met. Dividends received by a corporate U.S.\nHolder, except as described in the next section, generally will be eligible for\nthe 50% dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and\naccumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a U.S. Holder to the\nextent that the distributions do not exceed the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis\nin the shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted tax basis of such shares. To\nthe extent that distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings\nand profits exceed the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the shares, such\ndistributions will be treated as gain from the disposition of our common stock,\npreferred stock or depositary shares. In addition, a corporate U.S. Holder will\nnot be entitled to the dividends- received deduction on this portion of a\ndistribution. Limitations on Dividends-Received Deduction.A corporate U.S. Holder\nmay not be entitled to take the 50% dividends-received deduction in all\ncircumstances. Prospective corporate investors in our common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares should consider the effect of:\n                                                                                  \n      Section\u00a0246A of the Code, which reduces the dividends-received deduction    \n      allowed to a corporate U.S. Holder                                          \n      that has incurred indebtedness that is \u0093directly attributable\u0094 to an          \n      investment in portfolio stock, which may include our common stock,          \n      preferred stock, and depositary shares;                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Section\u00a0246(c) of the Code, which, among other things, disallows the        \n      dividends-received deduction in respect                                     \n      of any dividend on a share of stock that is held for less than the minimum  \n      holding period (generally, for common stock, at least 46 days during the    \n      91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before                 \n      the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such       \n      dividend); and                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Section\u00a01059 of the Code, which, under certain circumstances, reduces the   \n      basis of stock for purposes of                                              \n      calculating gain or loss in a subsequent disposition by the portion of any  \n      \u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094 (as defined below) that is eligible for the          \n      dividends-received deduction.                                               \n                                                                                  \nExtraordinary Dividends. A corporate U.S. Holder will be required to reduce its\ntax basis (but not below zero) in our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary\nshares by the nontaxed portion of any \u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094 if the stock was\nnot held for more than two years before the earliest of the date such dividend is\ndeclared, announced, or agreed. Generally, the nontaxed portion of an\nextraordinary dividend is the amount excluded from income by operation of the\ndividends-received deduction. An extraordinary dividend generally would be a\ndividend that:\n                                                                                  \n      in the case of common stock, equals or exceeds 10% of the corporate U.S.    \n      Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the                                           \n      common stock, treating all dividends having ex-dividend dates within an     \n      85-day period as one dividend; or                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      in the case of preferred stock, equals or exceeds 5% of the corporate U.S.  \n      Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in                                               \n      the preferred stock, treating all dividends having ex-dividend dates        \n      within an 85-day period as one dividend; or                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      exceeds 20% of the corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the stock,  \n      treating all dividends having ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period as  \n      one dividend.                                                               \n                                                                                  \n125\n\nIn determining whether a dividend paid on stock is an extraordinary dividend, a\ncorporate U.S. Holder may elect to substitute the fair market value of the stock\nfor its tax basis for purposes of applying these tests if the fair market value as\nof the day before the ex-dividenddate is established to the satisfaction of the\nSecretary of the Treasury. An extraordinary dividend also includes any amount\ntreated as a dividend in the case of a redemption that is either non-prorata as to\nall stockholders or in partial liquidation of the corporation, regardless of the\nstockholder\u0092s holding period and regardless of the size of the dividend. Any part\nof the nontaxed portion of an extraordinary dividend that is not applied to reduce\nthe corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis as a result of the limitation on reducing\nits basis below zero would be treated as gain from the disposition of such stock\nand would be recognized in the taxable year in which the extraordinary dividend is\nreceived. A non-corporateU.S. Holder that receives any extraordinary dividends\nwill be required to treat any losses on a taxable disposition of our common stock,\npreferred stock, or depositary shares as long-term capital losses to the extent\nthat such extraordinary dividends qualify for taxation at special rates as\nqualified dividend income. U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors\nwith respect to the possible application of the extraordinary dividend provisions\nof the Code to the ownership or disposition of common stock, preferred stock, or\ndepositary shares in their particular circumstances. Sale, Exchange, or other\nTaxable Disposition.Upon a taxable disposition of our common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares (other than by redemption or repurchase by us), a U.S.\nHolder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the\namount realized upon the taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares. The amount realized by the U.S. Holder will include the\namount of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received upon\nthe taxable disposition of the shares. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in a share\ngenerally will be equal to the cost of the share to such U.S. Holder, which may be\nadjusted for certain subsequent events (for example, if the U.S. Holder receives a\nnon-dividenddistribution, as described above). Gain or loss realized upon a\ntaxable disposition of our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares\ngenerally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss\nif the shares have been held for more than one year. Net long-term capital gain\nrecognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates.\nThe ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations\nunder the Code. If the U.S. Holder recognizes a loss above certain thresholds, the\nU.S. Holder may be required to file a Form 8886 with the IRS, as discussed under\n\u0093Reportable Transactions\u0094 below. Redemption or Repurchase of Common Stock,\nPreferred Stock, or Depositary Shares. If we are permitted to and redeem or\nrepurchase a U.S. Holder\u0092s common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares,\nthe redemption or repurchase generally would be a taxable event for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. A U.S. Holder would be treated as if it had sold its shares\nif the redemption or repurchase:\n                                                                                  \n      results in a complete termination of the U.S. Holder\u0092s stock interest in     \n      us;                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      is substantially disproportionate with respect to the U.S. Holder, in the   \n      case of voting shares; or                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the U.S.        \n      Holder, in each case as determined under the                                \n      Code and applicable treasury regulations.                                   \n                                                                                  \nIn determining whether any of these tests has been met, shares of stock considered\nto be owned by a U.S. Holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set\nforth in Section 318 of the Code, as well as shares actually owned, must be taken\ninto account. 126\n\nIf we redeem or repurchase a U.S. Holder\u0092s shares in a redemption or repurchase\nthat\nmeets one of the tests described above, the U.S. Holder generally would recognize\ntaxable gain or loss equal to the sum of the amount of cash and fair market value\nof property (other than our stock or the stock of a successor to us) received less\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the shares redeemed or repurchased. This gain or\nloss generally would be long-term capital gain or capital loss if the shares have\nbeen held for more than one year.\n\nIf a redemption or repurchase does not meet any of the tests described above, a\nU.S. Holder generally will be taxed on the cash and fair\nmarket value of the property received as a dividend to the extent paid out of our\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount in excess of our current\nand accumulated earnings and profits would first reduce the U.S. Holder\u0092s tax\nbasis in the shares and thereafter would be treated as capital gain. If a\nredemption or repurchase is treated as a distribution that is taxable as a\ndividend, the U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares would\nbe\ntransferred to the remaining shares of our stock that the U.S. Holder owns, if\nany.\n\nSpecial rules apply if we exchange our common stock,\npreferred stock, or depositary shares for our debt securities. We will discuss any\nspecial U.S. federal income tax considerations in the applicable supplement if we\nhave the option to redeem our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares\nfor our debt securities.\n\nConsequences to Non-U.S.Holders\n\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat will apply to\nNon-U.S. Holders of our common stock, preferred stock, and depositary shares.\n\nDistributions on Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and Depositary\nShares.Distributions made to Non-U.S. Holders out of our current or accumulated\nearnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and\nthat are not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a\ntrade or business within the United States, or a permanent establishment\nmaintained in the United States if certain tax treaties\napply, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income and withholding tax at a\nrate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable treaty, if any). Subject to the\ndiscussions below concerning backup withholding and FATCA, payments subject to\nwithholding of U.S. federal income tax may nevertheless be exempt from withholding\n(or subject to withholding at a reduced rate) if the Non-U.S. Holder provides us\nwith a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming\nan exemption from, or reduction in, withholding under the benefit of a tax treaty,\nor\nIRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that a dividend paid on our\nshares is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nUnited States, as discussed below.\n\nTo claim benefits under an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S.\nHolder must certify to us or the applicable withholding agent, under penalties of\nperjury, that it is a non-U.S. person and provide its name and address (which\ncertification may generally be made on an IRS\nForm W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, or a successor form), obtain and provide a taxpayer\nidentification number, and certify as to its\neligibility under the appropriate treaty\u0092s limitations on benefits article. In\naddition, special rules may apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S.\nHolders that are entities rather than\nindividuals. A Non-U.S. Holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal\nwithholding tax under an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess\namounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim\nfor refund with the IRS.\n\n127\n\nSale, Exchange, or other Taxable Disposition.Subject to the discussions below\nconcerning backup withholding and FATCA, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any capital gain realized\nupon a taxable disposition of our common stock,\npreferred stock, or depositary shares, provided that: (a) the gain is not\neffectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United\nStates, or a permanent establishment maintained in the United States if certain\ntax\ntreaties apply, (b) in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is an individual, the\nNon-U.S. Holder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the taxable disposition of the shares, (c) the Non-U.S. Holder is\nnot subject to tax pursuant to certain provisions of U.S. federal income tax law\napplicable to certain expatriates, and\n(d) we are not nor have we been a \u0093United States real property holding\ncorporation\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An individual Non-U.S. Holder\nwho is present in the United States for\n183 days or more in the taxable year of the taxable disposition of our common\nstock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, provided that certain other\nconditions are met, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on\nthe gains\nrealized upon the taxable disposition of such shares.\n\nWe believe that we are not currently, and do not anticipate becoming, a\n\u0093United States real property holding corporation\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n\nIncome Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business within the United States. If\na Non-U.S. Holder of our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares is\nengaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and if\ndividends on the shares, or gain realized upon a taxable disposition of the\nshares, are effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and,\nif certain tax treaties apply, are attributable to a permanent establishment\nmaintained by\nthe Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt\nfrom U.S. federal withholding tax (provided that the certification requirements\ndiscussed\nabove are satisfied), generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ndividends or gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S.\nHolder. Non-U.S. Holders should read the\nmaterial under the heading \u0093\u0097Consequences to U.S. Holders\u0094 above for a description\nof the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of\nour common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares. In\naddition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject\nto a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower rate under an applicable treaty, if\nany) of a portion of its earnings and\nprofits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a\ntrade or business in the United States, subject to certain adjustments.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than certain exempt holders, we\nand other payors are required to report to the IRS all\npayments of dividends on our common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares.\nIn addition, we and other payors generally are required to report to the IRS any\npayment of proceeds of the sale of common stock, preferred stock, or depositary\nshares. Additionally, backup withholding generally will apply to any dividend\npayment and to proceeds received upon a taxable disposition if a U.S. Holder fails\nto provide an accurate taxpayer identification number and certify that the\ntaxpayer\nidentification number is correct, the U.S. Holder is notified by the IRS that it\nhas failed to report all dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income\ntax returns, or the U.S. Holder does not certify that it has not underreported its\ninterest and dividend income.\n\nIn the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, backup withholding and\ninformation reporting will not apply to payments made if the Non-U.S. Holder\nprovides the required certification that it is not a U.S. person, as described\nabove, or the\nNon-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the payor or\nwithholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder\nis a U.S. person, or that the conditions of any\nexemption are not satisfied.\n\n128\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a\nrefund or a\ncredit against a holder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required\ninformation is furnished to the IRS.\n\nConvertible Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities\n\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to certain other of our\nequity securities, including preferred stock convertible into or\nexercisable or exchangeable for our common stock or other securities. The material\nU.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to these securities will be\ndiscussed in the applicable supplement. Investors should consult with their own\ntax\nadvisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to these securities.\n\nTaxation of Warrants\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of any special U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations with respect to\nthe acquisition, ownership and disposition of warrants offered in this prospectus,\nincluding any tax considerations relating to the specific terms of the warrants.\nInvestors considering the purchase of warrants we are offering should carefully\nexamine the applicable supplement regarding the special U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations, if any, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the\nwarrants.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences and the tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of warrants we are offering in light of\ntheir investment or tax circumstances.\n\nTaxation of Purchase Contracts\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of any special U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations with respect to the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of purchase contracts offered in this prospectus,\nincluding any tax considerations relating to the specific terms of the purchase\ncontracts. Investors considering the purchase of purchase contracts we are\noffering should\ncarefully examine the applicable supplement regarding the special U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations, if any, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition\nof the purchase contracts.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences and the tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of the purchase contracts in light of\ntheir investment or tax circumstances.\n\nTaxation of Units\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of any special U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations with\nrespect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of units that we are\noffering, including any tax considerations relating to the specific terms of the\nunits. Investors considering the purchase of units that we are offering should\ncarefully\nexamine the applicable supplement regarding the special U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences, if any, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the units.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences and the tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of units comprised of one or more of the\nsecurities we are offering in light of their investment or tax circumstances.\n\n129\n\nReportable Transactions\n\nApplicable Treasury regulations require taxpayers that participate in \u0093reportable\ntransactions\u0094 to disclose their participation to\nthe IRS by attaching Form 8886 to their U.S. federal tax returns and to retain a\ncopy of all documents and records related to the transaction. In addition,\n\u0093material advisors\u0094 with respect to such a transaction may be required to file\nreturns and maintain records, including lists identifying investors in the\ntransactions, and to furnish those records to the IRS upon demand. A transaction\nmay be a \u0093reportable transaction\u0094 based on any of several criteria, one or more of\nwhich may be present with respect to an investment in the securities that we are\noffering. Whether an investment in these securities constitutes a \u0093reportable\ntransaction\u0094 for any investor may depend on the investor\u0092s particular\ncircumstances. The Treasury regulations provide that, in addition to certain other\ntransactions, a \u0093loss transaction\u0094 constitutes a \u0093reportable transaction.\u0094 A \u0093loss\ntransaction\u0094 is any transaction resulting in the\ntaxpayer claiming a loss under Section 165 of the Code, in an amount equal to or\nin excess of certain threshold amounts, subject to certain exceptions. The\nTreasury regulations specifically provide that a loss resulting from a\n\u0093Section 988 transaction\u0094 will constitute a Section 165 loss, and certain\nexceptions will not be available if the loss from a taxable disposition is treated\nas ordinary under Section 988. In general, certain securities\nissued in a foreign currency will be subject to the rules governing foreign\ncurrency exchange gain or loss. Therefore, losses realized with respect to such a\nsecurity may constitute a Section 988 transaction, and a holder of such a security\nthat recognizes exchange loss in an amount that exceeds the loss threshold amount\napplicable to that holder may be required to file Form 8886. Investors should\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation they\nmay\nhave with respect to their investment in the securities that we are offering and\nshould be aware that, should any \u0093material advisor\u0094 determine that the return\nfiling or investor list maintenance requirements apply to such a transaction,\nthey would be required to comply with these requirements.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\n\nLegislation commonly known as \u0093FATCA\u0094 (sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code)\nimposes a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain\nU.S.-source payments, including interest (and OID), dividends, other fixed or\ndeterminable annual or periodical gain, profits, and income, and on the gross\nproceeds from a disposition of property of a type which can produce U.S.-source\ninterest or\ndividends (\u0093Withholdable Payments\u0094), if paid to a foreign financial institution\n(including amounts paid to a foreign financial institution on behalf of a holder),\nunless such institution enters into an agreement with the Treasury to\ncollect and provide to the Treasury certain information regarding U.S. financial\naccount holders, including certain account holders that are foreign entities with\nU.S. owners, with such institution or otherwise complies with FATCA. FATCA also\ngenerally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on Withholdable Payments made to a non-\nfinancial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a\ncertification that it does not have any\nsubstantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect\nsubstantial U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a holder may\nbe eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\n\nThese withholding and reporting requirements generally apply to U.S.-source\nperiodic payments and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or\nredemption. However, under proposed Treasury regulations (the preamble to which\nspecifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization), no\nwithholding under FATCA will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or\nredemption (other than income treated as U.S.-source \u0093fixed or determinable annual\nor periodical\u0094 income). If we (or an applicable withholding agent) determine\nwithholding under FATCA is appropriate, we (or such agent) will withhold tax at\nthe applicable statutory rate, without being required to pay any additional\namounts in respect of such withholding. Foreign financial institutions and non-\nfinancial foreign entities located in jurisdictions\nthat have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA\nmay be subject to different\n\n130\n\nrules. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the\npossible implications of FATCA on their investment in the debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares, or\ncommon stock.\n\n131\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST) We may sell the securities offered\nusing this prospectus:\n                             \n      through underwriters;  \n                             \n                        \n      through dealers;  \n                        \n                          \n      through agents;\u00a0or  \n                          \n                               \n      directly to purchasers.  \n                               \nIn addition, we may issue the securities as a dividend or distribution or in a\nsubscription rights offering to our existing security holders. The underwriters,\ndealers, or agents may include BofA Securities, Inc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094), or any of our\nother broker-dealer affiliates. Each supplement relating to an offering of\nsecurities will state the terms of the offering, including:\n                                                          \n      the names of any underwriters, dealers, or agents;  \n                                                          \n                                                                                  \n      the public offering or purchase price of the offered securities and the     \n      net proceeds that we will receive from                                      \n      the sale;                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any underwriting discounts and commissions or other items constituting      \n      underwriters\u0092 compensation;                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any discounts, commissions, or fees allowed or paid to dealers or agents;\u00a0  \n      and                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                              \n      any securities exchange on which the offered securities may be listed.  \n                                                                              \nDistribution Through Underwriters We may offer and sell securities from time to\ntime to one or more underwriters who would purchase the securities as principal\nfor resale to the public, either on a firm commitment or best efforts basis. If we\nsell securities to underwriters, we will execute an underwriting agreement with\nthem at the time of the sale and will name them in the applicable supplement. In\nconnection with these sales, the underwriters may be deemed to have received\ncompensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts and commissions. The\nunderwriters also may receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom\nthey may act as agent. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe underwriters will not be obligated to purchase the securities unless the\nconditions set forth in the underwriting agreement are satisfied, and if the\nunderwriters purchase any of the securities, they will be required to purchase all\nof the offered securities. The underwriters may acquire the securities for their\nown account and may resell the securities from time to time in one or more\ntransactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price\nor varying prices determined at the time of sale. The underwriters may sell the\noffered securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive discounts,\nconcessions, or commissions from the underwriters as well as from the purchasers\nfor whom they may act as agent. Any initial public offering price and any\ndiscounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be changed\nfrom time to time. 132\n\nDistribution Through Dealers\n\nWe may offer and sell securities from time to time to one or more dealers who\nwould purchase the securities as principal. The dealers then may\nresell the offered securities to the public at fixed or varying prices to be\ndetermined by those dealers at the time of resale. We will set forth the names of\nthe dealers and the terms of the transaction in the applicable supplement.\n\nDistribution Through Agents\n\nWe may offer and sell securities on a continuous basis through agents that become\nparties to an underwriting or distribution agreement. We\nwill name any agent involved in the offer and sale, and describe any commissions\npayable by us in the applicable supplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the agent will be acting on a best efforts basis during the\nappointment period.\n\nDirect Sales\n\nWe may sell directly to, and solicit offers from, institutional investors or\nothers who may be deemed to be underwriters, as defined in the\nSecurities Act, for any resale of the securities. We will describe the terms of\nany sales of this kind in the applicable supplement.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nUnderwriters, dealers, or agents participating in an offering of securities may be\ndeemed to be underwriters,\nand any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them\non resale of the offered securities for whom they act as agent, may be deemed to\nbe underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act.\n\nWe may offer to sell securities either at a fixed price or at prices that may\nvary, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices\nrelated to prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices. Securities may be\nsold in connection with a remarketing after their purchase by one or more firms\nincluding our affiliates, acting as principal for their own accounts or as our\nagent.\n\nIn connection with an underwritten offering of the securities, the underwriters\nmay engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and\nsyndicate covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange\nAct. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a\nshort position for the underwriters. The underwriters may enter bids for, and\npurchase, securities in the open market in order to stabilize the price of the\nsecurities. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in\nthe open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short\npositions. In addition, the underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions\nallowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the securities in the\noffering if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed securities in\ntransactions\nto cover syndicate short positions, in stabilization transactions, or otherwise.\nThese activities may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would\notherwise be. Those activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.\n\nOrdinarily, each issue of securities will be a new issue, and there will be no\nestablished trading market for any security other than our\ncommon stock prior to its original issue date. We may not list any particular\nseries of securities on a securities exchange or quotation system. Any\nunderwriters to whom or agents through whom the offered securities are sold for\noffering and sale\nmay make a market in the offered securities. However, any underwriters or agents\nthat make a market will not be obligated to do so and may stop doing so at any\ntime without notice. We cannot assure you that there will be a liquid trading\nmarket for\nthe offered securities.\n\n133\n\nIf we offer securities in a subscription rights offering to our existing security\nholders,\nwe may enter into a standby underwriting agreement with dealers, acting as standby\nunderwriters. We may pay the standby underwriters a commitment fee for the\nsecurities they commit to purchase on a standby basis. If we do not enter into a\nstandby\nunderwriting arrangement, we may retain a dealer-manager to manage a subscription\nrights offering for us.\n\nUnder agreements entered into\nwith us, underwriters and agents may be entitled to indemnification by us against\ncertain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to\ncontribution for payments the underwriters or agents may be required to make.\n\nDelivery of the securities will be made against payment therefor on or about the\nissue date specified in the applicable pricing supplement.\nUnder Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act trades in the secondary market generally are\nrequired to settle in two business days after the date the securities are priced,\nunless the parties to any such trade\nexpressly agree otherwise. Effective on May 28, 2024 (the \u0093settlement cycle\neffective date\u0094), the standard settlement cycle under Rule 15c6-1 will be\nshortened from two business days to one\nbusiness day. Accordingly, if the applicable pricing supplement specifies that the\nissue date is more than two business days (or, on or after the settlement cycle\neffective date, one business day) after the date on which the securities are\npriced,\npurchasers who wish to trade such securities at any time prior to the second\nbusiness day (or, on or after the settlement cycle effective date, the first\nbusiness day) preceding the issue date will be required, by virtue of the fact\nthat the\nsecurities will not settle in T+2 (or, on or after the settlement cycle effective\ndate, T+1), to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such\ntrade to prevent a failed settlement; such purchasers should also consult their\nown\nadvisors in this regard.\n\nMarket-Making Transactions by Affiliates\n\nFollowing the initial distribution of securities, our broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofAS, may buy and sell the securities in secondary\nmarket transactions as part of their business as broker-dealers. Resales of this\nkind may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated, at prevailing\nmarket prices at the time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. This\nprospectus\nand any related supplements may be used by one or more of our affiliates in\nconnection with these market-making transactions to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. Our affiliates may act as principal or agent in these\ntransactions.\n\nThe aggregate initial offering price specified on the cover of the applicable\nsupplement will relate to the initial offering of securities not\nyet issued as of the date of this prospectus. This amount does not include any\nsecurities to be sold in market-making transactions. The securities to be sold in\nmarket-making transactions include securities issued after the date of this\nprospectus.\n\nInformation about the trade and settlement dates, as well as the purchase price,\nfor a market-making transaction will be provided to the\npurchaser in a separate confirmation of sale.\n\nUnless we or our agent informs you in your confirmation of sale that the security\nis being purchased in its original offering and sale, you may assume that you are\npurchasing the security in a market-making transaction.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nBofAS is our wholly-owned subsidiary, and unless otherwise set forth in the\napplicable supplement, we will\nreceive the net proceeds of any offering in which BofAS participates as an\nunderwriter, dealer or agent. The offer and sale of any securities by BofAS, or\nany of our other\n\n134\n\nbroker-dealer affiliates that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc., or \u0093FINRA,\u0094 will comply with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121\nregarding a FINRA member\nfirm\u0092s offer and sale of securities of an affiliate. As required by FINRA Rule\n5121, any such offer and sale will not be made to any discretionary account\nwithout the prior approval of the customer.\n\nThe maximum commission or discount to be received by any FINRA member or\nindependent broker-dealer will not be greater than 8% of the initial\ngross proceeds from the sale of any security being sold.\n\nThe underwriters, agents and their affiliates may engage in financial or other\nbusiness transactions with us and our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of their\nbusiness activities, one or more of the underwriters, dealers or agents and/or\ntheir respective affiliates, may make or hold a broad array of investments and\nactively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and\nfinancial\ninstruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of\ntheir customers. These investments and securities activities may involve\nsecurities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. These underwriters,\ndealers or agents,\nor their affiliates, that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge\ntheir credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management\npolicies. Typically, these parties would hedge such exposure to us by entering\ninto\ntransactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the\ncreation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the\nsecurities offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future\ntrading\nprices of the securities offered hereby. These broker-dealers or their affiliates\nmay also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent\nresearch views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may\nhold, or\nrecommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such\nsecurities and instruments.\n\n135\n\nERISA CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\namended (\u0093ERISA\u0094), should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context\nof the ERISA plan\u0092s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in\nthe offered securities of Bank of America. Among other factors, the\nfiduciary should consider whether such an investment is in accordance with the\ndocuments governing the ERISA plan and whether the investment is appropriate for\nthe ERISA plan in view of its overall investment policy and diversification of its\nportfolio. A fiduciary should also consider whether an investment in the offered\nsecurities may constitute a \u0093prohibited transaction,\u0094 as described below.\n\nCertain provisions of ERISA and the Code, prohibit employee benefit plans (as\ndefined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to\nTitle I of ERISA, plans described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (including,\nwithout limitation, individual retirement accounts and retirement plans covering\nself-employed persons) that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and\nentities whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of such employee\nbenefit plan\u0092s or plan\u0092s investment in such entities (including, without\nlimitation, as applicable, insurance company general accounts) (each, a\n\u0093Plan\u0094 and collectively, \u0093Plans\u0094) from engaging in certain transactions involving\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 with persons that are \u0093parties in interest\u0094 under ERISA or\n\u0093disqualified persons\u0094 under the Code with\nrespect to the Plan (referred to as \u0093prohibited transactions\u0094).\n\nBecause of its businesses, each of Bank of America Corporation\nand certain of its affiliates may be considered a \u0093party in interest\u0094 or a\n\u0093disqualified person\u0094 with respect to many Plans on account of being a service\nprovider to such Plans. As a result, a prohibited transaction may arise if\nthe securities are acquired or held by or on behalf of a Plan unless those\nsecurities are acquired and held pursuant to an available exemption.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited transaction class\nexemptions (\u0093PTCEs\u0094) that may provide exemptive relief for\ndirect or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from or occurring in\nconnection with the purchase or holding of these securities by or on behalf of a\nPlan. Those class exemptions are PTCE 96-23 (for\ncertain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for\ncertain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 91-38\n(for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds), PTCE 90-1\n(for certain transactions involving insurance company separate accounts)\nand PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified\nprofessional asset managers). In addition, ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section\n4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an\nexemption for the purchase and sale of securities and related lending\ntransactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its\naffiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any\ninvestment advice\nwith respect to the assets of any plan involved in the transaction and provided\nfurther that the plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate\nconsideration in connection with the transaction (the\nso-called \u0093Service Provider Exemption\u0094). There can be no assurance that any of\nthese class or statutory exemptions or any other exemption will be available with\nrespect to transactions involving\nthese securities.\n\nGovernmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans (collectively, \u0093Non-\nERISA Arrangements\u0094), while not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the\nCode, may be subject to similar restrictions under state, federal, local or\nnon-U.S. laws or regulations (\u0093Similar Laws\u0094).\n\nAccordingly, unless otherwise provided\nin connection with a particular offering of securities, the offered securities may\nnot be purchased, held or disposed of by any Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement or any\nother person investing \u0093plan\nassets\u0094 of any Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement, unless one of the following\nexemptions (or a similar exemption or exception acceptable to us) applies to such\npurchase, holding, and disposition: the Service\nProvider Exemption, PTCE 96-23,\n\n136\n\nPTCE 95-60, PTCE 91-38, PTCE 90-1,or PTCE 84-14.Therefore, unless otherwise\nprovided in connection with a particular offering of securities, any purchaser of\nthe offered securities or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented\nand warranted to us on each day including the date of its purchase of the offered\nsecurities through and including the date of disposition of such offered\nsecurities that:\n                                                                                  \n       it is not a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement and is not purchasing such       \n  (a)  securities or interest therein on behalf of, or with \u0093plan assets\u0094 of, any   \n       Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement;                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       if it is a Plan or is purchasing such securities or interest therein on    \n       behalf of, or with \u0093plan                                                    \n  (b)  assets\u0094 of, a Plan, its purchase, holding, and disposition of such          \n       securities will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited        \n       transaction under ERISA or the Code; or                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       if it is a Non-ERISA Arrangement or is purchasing such securities or       \n       interest therein on behalf of, or with \u0093plan assets\u0094 of, a Non-ERISA         \n  (c)  Arrangement, its purchase, holding, and disposition of such securities     \n       will not violate any Similar Law and are not otherwise                     \n       prohibited.                                                                \n                                                                                  \nMoreover, any purchaser that is a Plan or is acquiring the offered securities on\nbehalf of a Plan, including any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of a Plan, will be\ndeemed to have represented, in its corporate and its fiduciary capacity, by its\npurchase and holding of the offered securities that (a) neither we, any of the\nunderwriters nor any of our or their respective affiliates (collectively, the\n\u0093Sellers\u0094) is a \u0093fiduciary\u0094 (under Section 3(21) of ERISA, or under any final or\nproposed regulations thereunder, or with respect to a Non-ERISAArrangement, under\nany Similar Laws) with respect to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the\noffered securities, or as a result of any exercise by any Seller of any rights in\nconnection with the offered securities, (b) no advice provided by any Seller has\nformed a primary basis for any investment decision by or on behalf of such\npurchaser in connection with the offered securities and the transactions\ncontemplated with respect to the securities, and (c) such purchaser recognizes and\nagrees that any communication from the Sellers to the purchaser with respect to\nthe offered securities is not intended by the Sellers to be impartial investment\nadvice and is rendered in its capacity as a seller of such offered securities and\nnot as a fiduciary to such purchaser, in each case, in connection with the initial\noffering of the Securities. This discussion is a general summary of some of the\nrules which apply to Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement and their related investment\nvehicles as of the date of this prospectus. The rules governing investments by\nPlan or Non-ERISAArrangement change frequently, and we have no duty to, nor will\nwe, inform you about any changes to such rules if and when they occur. This\nsummary does not describe all of the rules or other considerations that may be\nrelevant to the investment in the offered securities by such plans or\narrangements. The description above is not, and should not be construed as, legal\nadvice or a legal opinion. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties\nimposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions, it is important that any\nperson considering the purchase of the offered securities with plan assets consult\nwith its counsel regarding the consequences under ERISA and the Code, or any\nSimilar Law, of the acquisition and holding of offered securities and the\navailability of exemptive relief under the class or statutory exemptions listed\nabove or under any other exemption. The sale of the securities of Bank of America\nto a Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement is in no respect a representation by any Seller\nthat such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to\ninvestments by Plans or Non-ERISAArrangements generally or any particular Plan or\nNon-ERISAArrangement, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans or Non-\nERISAArrangements generally or any particular Plan or Non-ERISAArrangements. 137\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We have filed a registration statement on Form\nS-3with the SEC covering the securities to be offered and sold using this\nprospectus.

notes involves significant risks. Your decision to purchase\nthe notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an\ninvestment in the notes, including those discussed below in this prospectus\nsupplement relating to floating-rate notes, floating rates of interest, fixed-rate\nreset notes and fixed-rate reset rates of interest, and in the applicable\nsupplement for the specific notes, with your advisors in light of your particular\ncircumstances. The notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not\nknowledgeable about significant elements of the notes or financial matters in\ngeneral. For information regarding risks and uncertainties that may materially\naffect our business and results, please refer to the information under the\ncaptions \u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in our annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year\nended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed in the accompanying\nprospectus and our subsequent filings that are incorporated by reference in the\naccompanying prospectus. You also should review the risk factors that will be set\nforth in other documents that we will file after the date of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nThis discussion of risks uses a number of capitalized and other defined terms that\nare defined elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. A listing of the pages on\nwhich certain of such terms are defined can be found under the Index of Certain\nDefined Terms at the end of this prospectus supplement.\n\nRisks Relating to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and SOFR Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u0093SOFR\u0094) and SOFR notes generally.In this discussion, references to\u0093SOFR\nnotes\u0094mean a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes. You\nshould carefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing in\nSOFR notes.\n\nAny failure of SOFR to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the SOFR notes and result in a limited secondary trading\nmarket for the SOFR notes.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork\u0092s Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u0093ARRC\u0094), SOFR was developed for\nuse in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts as an\nalternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars\n(\u0093U.S. Dollar LIBOR\u0094) in part because it is considered a good representation of\ngeneral funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement\nmarket. However, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is\nless likely to correlate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of banks.\nThis may mean that market participants would not consider SOFR a suitable\nsubstitute,\nreplacement or successor for U.S. Dollar LIBOR, which may, in turn, lead to\nlessened market acceptance of SOFR.\n\nTo the extent market\nacceptance for SOFR as a benchmark for floating-rate notes declines, the return on\nand value of the SOFR notes and the price at which investors can sell the SOFR\nnotes in the secondary market could be adversely affected. In addition, investors\nin\nthe SOFR notes may not be able to sell the SOFR notes at all or may not be able to\nsell the SOFR notes at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to\nsimilar investments that continue to have a developed secondary market, and may\nconsequently suffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk. Further,\ninvestors wishing to sell any securities linked to SOFR in the secondary market\nwill have to make assumptions as to the future performance of SOFR during the\ninterest\npayment period in which they intend the sale to take place. As a result, investors\nmay suffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nS-9\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus supplement, there are multiple market\nconventions with\nrespect to the implementation of SOFR as a base rate for floating-rate notes or\nother securities. The manner of calculation and related conventions with respect\nto the determination of interest rates based on SOFR in floating-rate notes\nmarkets may\ndiffer materially within floating-rate notes markets and compared with the manner\nof calculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of\ninterest rates based on SOFR in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan\nmarkets.\nInvestors should carefully consider how any potential inconsistencies between the\nmanner of calculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of\ninterest or other payment rates based on SOFR across these markets may impact any\nhedging or other financial arrangements that they may put in place in connection\nwith any acquisition, holding or disposition of the SOFR notes.\n\nSOFR may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the \u0093FRBNY\u0094) (or a successor), as\nadministrator of SOFR, may make methodological or other\nchanges that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to the\nmethod by which SOFR is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the\ntransactions used to calculate SOFR, or timing related to the publication of SOFR.\nThe\nadministrator of SOFR may withdraw, modify, amend, suspend or discontinue the\ncalculation or dissemination of SOFR in its sole discretion and without notice and\nhas no obligation to consider the interests of investors in the SOFR notes in\ncalculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending, suspending or discontinuing SOFR.\nFor purposes of the formula used to calculate interest with respect to a series of\nSOFR notes, SOFR in respect of a particular date will not be adjusted for any\nmodifications or amendments to SOFR data that the administrator of SOFR may\npublish after the interest rate on SOFR notes for that day has been determined in\naccordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement\nand the\napplicable supplement.\n\nRisks Relating to the Sterling Overnight Index Average and Compounded SONIA Notes\nGenerally\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to the Sterling Overnight\nIndex Average rate (\u0093SONIA\u0094) and compounded SONIA notes generally. You should\ncarefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing in\ncompounded SONIA notes.\n\nSONIA may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected compounded SONIA notes.\n\nThe Bank of England (the \u0093BoE\u0094) (or a successor), as administrator of SONIA, may\nmake methodological or other changes that could\nchange the value of SONIA, including changes related to the method by which SONIA\nis calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to\ncalculate SONIA, or timing related to the publication of SONIA (which may include\nwithdrawing, suspending or discontinuing the calculation or dissemination of\nSONIA). In addition, the BoE may make any or all of these changes in its sole\ndiscretion and without notice, and it has no obligation to consider the interests\nof investors\nin any compounded SONIA notes in calculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending,\nsuspending or discontinuing SONIA. We have no control over the methods of\ncalculation, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of\nSONIA or the\nSONIA Index at any time.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that SONIA will not be modified or discontinued in a\nmanner that is materially adverse\nto an investor in a series of compounded SONIA notes. If the manner in which SONIA\nis calculated is changed or if SONIA is discontinued, that change or\ndiscontinuance could reduce or otherwise negatively impact the amount of interest\nthat accrues on\na series of compounded SONIA notes, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of and market for such series of compounded SONIA notes.\n\nS-10\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a base rate for floating-\nrate notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a base rate as an\nalternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate for\npounds sterling. In particular, market participants and relevant working groups\nstill are exploring alternative reference rates based on the risk free rates,\nincluding, for example, term SONIA reference rates which seek to measure the\nmarket\u0092s\nforward expectation of an average SONIA rate over a designated term.\n\nThe market or a significant part thereof may adopt an application of\nSONIA that differs significantly from that set out and used in the terms and\nprovisions relating to a particular series of compounded SONIA notes. If the\nmarket adopts a different calculation method, that would likely adversely affect\nthe market\nprice of the applicable series of compounded SONIA notes.\n\nIn the future, we may also issue notes referencing SONIA that differ materially\nin terms of interest determination when compared with any previous notes\nreferencing SONIA. The development of SONIA as an interest base rate for the\nEurobond markets, as well as continued development of the market infrastructure\nfor adopting such\nrates, could result in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or could\notherwise affect the market price of any compounded SONIA notes.\n\nThe manner of adoption or application of SONIA in the Eurobond markets may differ\nmaterially compared with the application and adoption of\nSONIA in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets. Investors should\ncarefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption of SONIA in the bond,\nloan and derivatives markets may impact any hedging or other financial arrangement\nwhich they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or\ndisposal of compounded SONIA notes.\n\nRisks Relating to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average and Compounded CORRA\nNotes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate\nAverage (\u0093CORRA\u0094) and compounded CORRA notes generally. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before investing in compounded CORRA\nnotes.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of CORRA are not the same as those of CDOR,\nand CORRA is not expected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for CDOR.\n\nIn October 2020, the mandate of the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working\ngroup (\u0093CARR\u0094) of the\nBank of Canada was expanded to contemplate a primary objective of supporting the\nadoption of, and transition to, CORRA as a key financial benchmark for Canadian\nderivatives and securities, and to analyze the current status of the Canadian\nDollar\nOffered Rate (\u0093CDOR\u0094). The composition and characteristics of CORRA are not the\nsame as those of CDOR. CORRA measures the cost of overnight general collateral\nfunding in Canadian dollars using Government of Canada treasury bills and bonds\nas collateral for repurchase transactions. CORRA is not the economic equivalent of\nCDOR. While CORRA is a secured rate, CDOR is an unsecured rate. And, while CORRA\nis an overnight rate, CDOR is a committed bank lending rate or \u0093executable\nrate\u0094 at which contributing banks are obligated to lend funds to corporate\nborrowers with existing committed credit facilities referencing CDOR, and which is\ncalculated using submitted rates from a panel of contributor banks. As a result,\nthere\ncan be no assurance that CORRA will perform in the same way as CDOR would have at\nany time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and\nyield rates in the market, bank credit risk, market volatility or global or\nregional\neconomic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. For the same\nreasons, CORRA is not expected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for\nCDOR. For example, daily changes in\n\nS-11\n\nCORRA have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in other benchmark\nor market rates, such as CDOR, during corresponding periods. See also \u0093\u0097Any\nfailure of CORRA to\nmaintain market acceptance could adversely affect the return on or value of the\ncompounded CORRA notes and result in a limited secondary trading market for the\ncompounded CORRA notes\u0094 below.\n\nThe Applicable Fallback Rate for compounded CORRA notes may not be a suitable\nreplacement for CORRA.\n\nThe terms of the compounded CORRA notes provide for a waterfall of alternative\nrates to be used to determine the rate of interest on the\ncompounded CORRA notes if an Index Cessation Event and a related Index Cessation\nEffective Date occur with respect to CORRA. The first alternative rate to CORRA in\nthe waterfall is the CAD Recommended Rate, which is the rate recommended as the\nreplacement for CORRA by a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Bank\nof Canada for the purpose of recommending a replacement for CORRA. If the CAD\nRecommended Rate is not available at the time of an Index Cessation Effective Date\nwith\nrespect to CORRA, or if a CAD Recommended Rate is available at such time and an\nIndex Cessation Effective Date subsequently occurs with respect to it, the next\nalternative rate in the waterfall is the BOC Target Rate, which is the Bank of\nCanada\u0092s target for the overnight rate as set by the Bank of Canada and published\non the Bank of Canada\u0092s website. Uncertainty with respect to market conventions\nrelated to the calculation of these CORRA fallback rates and whether either\nalternative reference rate is a suitable replacement or successor for CORRA may\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for the compounded CORRA\nnotes.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the characteristics of any of the alternative rates\nfor CORRA will be similar to those of CORRA, or that any\nsuch alternative rate will produce the economic equivalent of the applicable CORRA\nrate as a reference rate for interest on an applicable series of compounded CORRA\nnotes. Although the CORRA fallback provisions provide for us or our designee\n(after\nconsulting with us) to make certain term and spread adjustments to the Applicable\nFallback Rate in order to attempt to make the resulting rate comparable to CORRA,\nsuch adjustments will not necessarily make the alternative rate equivalent to the\napplicable CORRA rate.\n\nIn addition to the term and spread adjustments that we or our designee (after\nconsulting with us) may make to an\nApplicable Fallback Rate, the terms of the compounded CORRA notes expressly\nauthorize us or our designee, after consulting with us, in connection with\nimplementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate to make certain changes to the terms\nand provisions\nof the applicable series of compounded CORRA notes with respect to, among other\nthings, the determination of interest periods and the timing and frequency of\ndetermining rates and making payments of interest and other administrative\nmatters. The\napplication of an Applicable Fallback Rate, including any term and/or spread\nadjustments that may be made to such rate by us or our designee (after consulting\nwith us), and any implementation by us or our designee (after consulting with us)\nof any\nother applicable changes to the terms and provisions of a series of compounded\nCORRA notes in connection with the implementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate,\ncould result in adverse consequences to the interest rate or the amount of\ninterest\npayable on the notes, which could adversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for such notes and the price at which investors may be able to sell such\nnotes.\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections with respect to the\nApplicable Fallback Rate, any term or spread adjustments to the\nApplicable Fallback Rate, and any other changes to the terms and provisions of an\napplicable series of compounded CORRA notes in connection with the implementation\nof an Applicable Fallback Rate, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of an Index\nCessation Event, may require the exercise of discretion and the making of\nsubjective judgments by us or our designee (after consulting with us). Any\ndetermination, decision\n\nS-12\n\nor election made by us or our designee pursuant to the fallback provisions with\nrespect to CORRA set forth in this prospectus supplement will, if made by us, be\nmade in our sole discretion and,\nif made by our designee, be made after consultation with us and, in each case,\nwill become effective without consent from the investors in the affected\ncompounded CORRA notes or any other party. We may designate an entity to make any\ndetermination,\ndecision or election that we have the right to make in connection with the CORRA\nfallback provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement. Any designee that we\nmay appoint in connection with these determinations, decisions or elections may be\nour\naffiliate. When performing such functions, potential conflicts of interest may\nexist between us, our designee and investors in the compounded CORRA notes and\nmaking such potentially subjective determinations may adversely affect the return\non, value\nof and market for the compounded CORRA notes. All determinations by us or our\ndesignee in our or its discretion will be conclusive for all purposes and binding\non us and investors in the applicable compounded CORRA notes absent manifest\nerror.\n\nAny failure of CORRA to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the compounded CORRA notes and result in a limited secondary\ntrading market for the compounded CORRA notes.\n\nAs a rate based on transactions secured by Government of Canada\ntreasury bills and bonds, CORRA does not measure unsecured corporate credit risk\nand, as a result, is less likely to correlate with the unsecured short-term\nfunding costs of corporations. This may mean that market participants would not\nconsider\nCORRA a suitable substitute or successor for CDOR, which may, in turn, lead to\nlessened market acceptance of CORRA.\n\nTo the extent market\nacceptance for CORRA as a benchmark for floating-rate notes declines, the return\non and value of the compounded CORRA notes and the price at which investors can\nsell the compounded CORRA notes in the secondary market could be adversely\naffected. In\naddition, investors in the compounded CORRA notes may not be able to sell the\ncompounded CORRA notes at all or may not be able to sell the compounded CORRA\nnotes at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar\ninvestments that\ncontinue to have a developed secondary market, and may consequently suffer from\nincreased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nThe\nmethodology for calculating compounded CORRA for other compounded CORRA notes that\nwe may issue may change, and we may in the future issue other compounded CORRA\nnotes that differ materially in terms of interest determination when compared with\nany\nprevious compounded CORRA notes. The continued development of CORRA as a reference\nrate for the capital markets, as well as continued development of CORRA-based\nrates for such market and the market infrastructure for adopting such rates, could\nresult in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or could otherwise affect the\nmarket price of any compounded CORRA notes from time to time.\n\nCORRA may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected compounded CORRA notes.\n\nThe Bank of Canada, which has been the administrator of CORRA since June 2020 and\nwhich commenced publishing the CORRA compounded\nindex in April 2021, may make methodological or other changes that could change\nthe value of CORRA or the CORRA compounded index, including changes related to the\nmethod by which CORRA or the CORRA compounded index are calculated, eligibility\ncriteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate CORRA, or timing related\nto the publication of CORRA or the CORRA compounded index. If the manner in which\nCORRA or the CORRA compounded index are calculated is changed, such change may\nresult in a reduction of the amount of interest payable on compounded CORRA notes,\nwhich may adversely affect the trading prices of compounded CORRA notes. The\nadministrator of CORRA and the CORRA compounded\n\nS-13\n\nindex may withdraw, modify, amend, suspend or discontinue the calculation or\ndissemination of CORRA or the CORRA compounded index in its sole discretion and\nwithout notice and has no obligation\nto consider the interests of investors in compounded CORRA notes in calculating,\nwithdrawing, modifying, amending, suspending or discontinuing CORRA or the CORRA\ncompounded index. For purposes of the formula used to calculate interest with\nrespect\nto a series of compounded CORRA notes, neither CORRA nor the CORRA compounded\nindex, as applicable, in respect of a particular date will be adjusted for any\nmodifications or amendments to CORRA or the CORRA compounded index data that the\nadministrator of CORRA or the CORRA compounded index may publish after the\ninterest rate on compounded CORRA notes for that day has been determined in\naccordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement\nand the\napplicable supplement.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that either CORRA or the CORRA compounded index will not\nbe modified or discontinued in\na manner that is materially adverse to an investor in compounded CORRA notes. If\nthe manner in which CORRA or the CORRA compounded index is calculated is changed,\nor if CORRA or the CORRA compounded index are discontinued, such change or\ndiscontinuance could reduce or otherwise negatively impact the amount of interest\nthat accrues on a series of compounded CORRA notes, which could adversely affect\nthe return on, value of and market for such series of compounded CORRA notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to CORRA as a base rate for floating-\nrate notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to CORRA as a base rate for floating-\nrate notes.\n\nThe market or a significant part thereof may adopt an application of CORRA that\ndiffers significantly from that set out and used in the terms\nand provisions relating to the compounded CORRA notes. The use of the specific\nformula used to calculate compounded CORRA with respect to a series of notes may\nnot be widely adopted by other market participants, if at all. If the market\nadopts a\ndifferent calculation method, that would likely adversely affect the market price\nof the applicable series of compounded CORRA notes.\n\nIn\nthe future, we may also issue notes referencing compounded CORRA that differ\nmaterially in terms of interest determination when compared with any previous\nnotes referencing compounded CORRA. The development of compounded CORRA as a base\nrate for the\nCanadian bond markets, as well as continued development of the market\ninfrastructure for adopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or\nincreased volatility or could otherwise affect the market price of any compounded\nCORRA notes.\n\nThe manner of adoption or application of CORRA in the Canadian bond market may\ndiffer materially compared with the application and adoption of\nCORRA in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets. Investors should\ncarefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption of CORRA in the bond,\nloan and derivatives markets may impact any hedging or other financial arrangement\nwhich they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or\ndisposal of compounded CORRA notes.\n\nRisks Relating to the Australian Overnight Index Average Rate and Compounded AONIA\nNotes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the Australian Overnight Index\nAverage (\u0093AONIA\u0094) rate and compounded AONIA notes generally. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before investing in compounded AONIA\nnotes.\n\nS-14\n\nThe composition and characteristics of AONIA are not the same as those of BBSW,\nand AONIA is not expected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for BBSW.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of AONIA are not the same\nas those of BBSW. While BBSW is a forward-looking term rate based on observed bid\nand offer rates for Australian prime bank eligible securities (which rates may\nincorporate a premium for credit risk), AONIA is an overnight, risk free cash rate\nand\nis not the economic equivalent of BBSW. As a result, there can be no assurance\nthat AONIA will perform in the same way as BBSW would have at any time, including,\nwithout limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the\nmarket,\nbank credit risk, market volatility or global or regional economic, financial,\npolitical, regulatory, judicial or other events. For the same reasons, AONIA is\nnot expected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for BBSW. See also\n\u0093\u0097Any failure of AONIA to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the compounded AONIA notes and result in a limited secondary\ntrading market for the compounded AONIA notes\u0094 below.\n\nThe Applicable Fallback Rate for compounded AONIA notes may not be a suitable\nreplacement for AONIA.\n\nThe terms of the compounded AONIA notes provide for a waterfall of alternative\nrates to be used to determine the rate of interest on the\ncompounded AONIA notes if a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger and a related\nPermanent Fallback Effective Date occur with respect to AONIA. The first\nalternative rate to AONIA in the waterfall is the RBA Recommended Rate, which is\nthe rate (inclusive\nof any spreads or adjustments) recommended as the replacement for AONIA by the\nReserve Bank of Australia. If the RBA Recommended Rate is not available at the\ntime of a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger with respect to AONIA and related\nPermanent\nFallback Effective Date, or if an RBA Recommended Rate is available at such time\nand a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger and related Permanent Fallback Effective\nDate subsequently occur with respect to it, the next alternative rate in the\nwaterfall\nis the Final Fallback Rate, which is the rate determined by us or our designee\n(after consulting with us) as a commercially reasonable alternative for the\nApplicable Benchmark Rate taking into account all available information that, in\ngood faith,\nwe or our designee (after consulting with us) considers relevant, together with\n(without double counting) such spread adjustment (which may be a positive or\nnegative value or zero) that is customarily applied to the relevant successor rate\nor\nalternative rate (as the case may be) in international debt capital markets\ntransactions to produce an industry-accepted replacement rate for AONIA-linked\nfloating rate notes at such time. Uncertainty with respect to market conventions\nrelated to\nthe calculation of these AONIA fallback rates and whether either alternative\nreference rate is a suitable replacement or successor for AONIA may adversely\naffect the return on, value of and market for the compounded AONIA notes.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the characteristics of any of the alternative rates\nfor AONIA will be similar to those of AONIA, or that any\nsuch alternative rate will produce the economic equivalent of the applicable AONIA\nrate as a reference rate for interest on an applicable series of compounded AONIA\nnotes. Although the AONIA fallback provisions provide for us or our designee\n(after\nconsulting with us) to make certain term and spread adjustments to the Applicable\nFallback Rate in order to attempt to make the resulting rate comparable to AONIA,\nsuch adjustments will not necessarily make the alternative rate equivalent to the\napplicable AONIA rate.\n\nIn addition to the spread adjustments that we or our designee (after consulting\nwith us) may make to an Applicable\nFallback Rate, the terms of the compounded AONIA notes expressly authorize us or\nour designee, after consulting with us, in connection with implementation of an\nApplicable Fallback Rate to make certain changes to the terms and provisions of\nthe\napplicable series of compounded AONIA notes with respect to, among other things,\nthe determination of\n\nS-15\n\ninterest periods and the timing and frequency of determining rates and making\npayments of interest and other administrative matters. The application of an\nApplicable Benchmark Rate, including any\nspread adjustment that may be made to such rate by us or our designee (after\nconsulting with us), and any implementation by us or our designee (after\nconsulting with us) of any other applicable changes to the terms and provisions of\na series of\ncompounded AONIA notes in connection with the implementation of an Applicable\nFallback Rate, could result in adverse consequences to the interest rate or the\namount of interest payable on the notes, which could adversely affect the return\non, value\nof and market for such notes and the price at which investors may be able to sell\nsuch notes.\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions\nand elections with respect to the Applicable Fallback Rate, any spread adjustments\nto the Applicable Fallback Rate, and any other changes to the terms and provisions\nof an applicable series of compounded AONIA notes in connection with the\nimplementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate, or the occurrence or non-occurrence\nof a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger, may require the exercise of discretion and\nthe making of subjective judgments by us or\nour designee (after consulting with us). Any determination, decision or election\nmade by us or our designee pursuant to the fallback provisions with respect to\nAONIA set forth in this prospectus supplement will, if made by us, be made in our\nsole\ndiscretion and, if made by our designee, be made after consultation with us and,\nin each case, will become effective without consent from the investors in the\naffected compounded AONIA notes or any other party. We may designate an entity to\nmake any\ndetermination, decision or election that we have the right to make in connection\nwith the AONIA fallback provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement. Any\ndesignee that we may appoint in connection with these determinations, decisions or\nelections may be our affiliate. When performing such functions, potential\nconflicts of interest may exist between us, our designee and investors in the\ncompounded AONIA notes and making such potentially subjective determinations may\nadversely affect\nthe return on, value of and market for the compounded AONIA notes. All\ndeterminations by us or our designee in our or its discretion will be conclusive\nfor all purposes and binding on us and investors in the applicable compounded\nAONIA notes absent\nmanifest error.\n\nAny failure of AONIA to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the compounded AONIA notes and result in a limited secondary\ntrading market for the compounded AONIA notes.\n\nAs an overnight, risk free cash rate,\nAONIA does not measure unsecured corporate credit risk and, as a result, is less\nlikely to correlate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of corporations.\nThis may mean that market participants would not consider AONIA a suitable\nsubstitute\nor successor for BBSW, which may, in turn, lead to lessened market acceptance of\nAONIA.\n\nTo the extent market acceptance for AONIA as a\nbenchmark for floating-rate notes declines, the return on and value of the\ncompounded AONIA notes and the price at which investors can sell the compounded\nAONIA notes in the secondary market could be adversely affected. In addition,\ninvestors in the\ncompounded AONIA notes may not be able to sell the compounded AONIA notes at all\nor may not be able to sell the compounded AONIA notes at prices that will provide\nthem with a yield comparable to similar investments that continue to have a\ndeveloped\nsecondary market, and may consequently suffer from increased pricing volatility\nand market risk.\n\nThe market or a significant part thereof\nmay adopt an application of AONIA that differs significantly from that used in\nrelation to the compounded AONIA notes, which could result in reduced liquidity or\notherwise affect the market price of the notes. Furthermore, the methodology for\ncalculating compounded AONIA for other compounded AONIA notes that we may issue\nmay change, and we may in the future issue other compounded AONIA notes that\ndiffer materially in\n\nS-16\n\nterms of interest determination when compared with any previous compounded AONIA\nnotes. The continued development of AONIA as an interest reference rate for the\ncapital markets, as well as\ncontinued development of AONIA-based rates for such market and the market\ninfrastructure for adopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or\nincreased volatility or could otherwise affect the market price of any compounded\nAONIA notes from\ntime to time.\n\nAONIA may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected compounded AONIA notes.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia, as the administrator of AONIA, may make\nmethodological or other changes that\ncould change the value of AONIA, including changes related to the method by which\nAONIA is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to\ncalculate AONIA, or timing related to the publication of AONIA. If the manner in\nwhich\nAONIA is calculated is changed, such change may result in a reduction of the\namount of interest payable on compounded AONIA notes, which may adversely affect\nthe trading prices of compounded AONIA notes. The administrator of AONIA may\nwithdraw,\nmodify, amend, suspend or discontinue the calculation or dissemination of AONIA in\nits sole discretion and without notice and has no obligation to consider the\ninterests of investors in compounded AONIA notes in calculating, withdrawing,\nmodifying,\namending, suspending or discontinuing AONIA. For purposes of the formula used to\ncalculate interest with respect to a series of compounded AONIA notes, AONIA in\nrespect of a particular date will be adjusted for any modifications or amendments\nto\nAONIA data that the administrator of AONIA may publish after the interest rate on\ncompounded AONIA notes for that day has been determined in accordance with the\nterms and provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement and the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that AONIA will not be modified or discontinued in a\nmanner that is materially adverse to an\ninvestor in compounded AONIA notes. If the manner in which AONIA is calculated is\nchanged, or if AONIA is discontinued, such change or discontinuance could reduce\nor otherwise negatively impact the amount of interest that accrues on a series of\ncompounded AONIA notes, which could adversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for such series of compounded AONIA notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to AONIA as a base rate for floating-\nrate notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation\nto AONIA as a base rate for floating-rate notes.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus supplement, there are limited floating-rate\nnotes in\nthe market using AONIA as a benchmark. Therefore, the return on and value of the\ncompounded AONIA notes and the price at which investors can sell the compounded\nAONIA notes in the secondary market could be limited.\n\nIn the future, we may also issue notes referencing compounded AONIA that differ\nmaterially in terms of interest determination when compared\nwith any previous notes referencing compounded AONIA. The development of\ncompounded AONIA as interest base rates for the Australian bond markets, as well\nas continued development of the market infrastructure for adopting such rates,\ncould result in\nreduced liquidity or increased volatility or could otherwise affect the market\nprice of any compounded AONIA notes.\n\nThere currently is no\nuniform market convention with respect to the implementation of risk free rates as\na base rate for floating-rate notes or other securities. The manner of adoption or\napplication of AONIA in the Australian bond market may differ materially compared\nwith the\n\nS-17\n\napplication and adoption of AONIA in other markets, such as the derivatives and\nloan markets. Investors should carefully consider how any mismatch between the\nadoption of AONIA in the bond, loan\nand derivatives markets may impact any hedging or other financial arrangement\nwhich they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or\ndisposal of compounded AONIA notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Compounded SOFR Notes, Compounded SONIA Notes, Compounded CORRA\nNotes, Compounded AONIA Notes and Simple Average SOFR Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to compounded SOFR notes,\ncompounded SONIA notes, compounded CORRA notes, compounded AONIA notes and simple\naverage SOFR notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, compounded SOFR notes\nusing the SOFR Index convention and compounded SONIA notes using the SONIA\nCompounded Index convention). In this discussion, references to \u0093compounded notes\u0094\nmean a series of compounded SOFR notes, compounded SONIA notes, compounded CORRA\nnotes or compounded AONIA notes, as applicable, references to \u0093daily rate\u0094 mean\nSOFR, SONIA or CORRA, as applicable, andreferences to \u0093compounded index\u0094 mean the\nSOFR Index or the SONIA Compounded Index, as applicable. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before investing in compounded notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes\nwill be based on a compounded or simple average, respectively, of the applicable\ndaily rate. Such compounded and simple average rates are relatively new in the\nmarketplace.\n\nFor each\ninterest period, the interest rate on a series of compounded notes or simple\naverage SOFR notes will be based on a compounded or simple average, respectively,\nof the applicable daily rate calculated as described under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes,\u0094 in this prospectus supplement. For this and other\nreasons, the interest rate on a series of compounded notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes during any interest period may not be the same as the interest rate on\nother instruments bearing interest at a rate based on SOFR, SONIA or CORRA, as\napplicable, that use an alternative method to determine the applicable interest\nrate. Further, if a daily rate in respect of a particular date during an interest\nperiod\nor observation period, if applicable, for a series of compounded notes or simple\naverage SOFR notes is negative, the inclusion of such daily rate in the\ncalculation of compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes for the applicable\ninterest period\nwill reduce the interest rate and the interest payable on such series of\ncompounded notes or simple average SOFR notes, as applicable, for such interest\nperiod.\n\nThe method for calculating an interest rate based upon compounded SOFR, compounded\nSONIA, compounded CORRA, compounded AONIA or simple average\nSOFR (for example, payment delays, observation periods/lookbacks and/or\nlockout/suspension periods) in market precedents varies. This variation in the\nmarket could adversely affect the return on, value of and market for the\ncompounded notes. In\naddition, the specific formula for the compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA,\ncompounded CORRA, compounded AONIA or simple average SOFR used in the notes may\nnot continue to be utilized by other market participants. If the market\ntransitions to a\ndifferent calculation method, that would likely adversely affect the market value\nof such notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes\nwill be determined only at the end of the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments\ndue on a series of compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes will be\ndetermined only at the end of the relevant interest period. Therefore, investors\nin any series of compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes will not know the\namount of\ninterest payable with respect to each interest period until shortly prior to the\nrelated interest payment date, and it may be difficult for investors in such\ncompounded notes or simple average SOFR notes to estimate\n\nS-18\n\nreliably the amounts of interest that will be payable on each such interest\npayment date at the beginning of or during the relevant interest period. In\naddition, some investors may be unwilling\nor unable to trade such compounded notes or simple average SOFR notes without\nchanges to their information technology systems, which could adversely impact the\nliquidity and trading price of any series of compounded notes or simple average\nSOFR\nnotes.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the payment delay convention,\nor simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate lookback, it will not be\npossible to calculate accrued interest with respect to any period until after the\nend of such period.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the payment delay convention,\nor simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate lookback,\nthe applicable daily rate in respect of a given day is not published until the\nU.S. government securities business day, London banking day or Toronto banking\nday, as applicable, immediately following such day. As a result, it will not be\npossible to\ncalculate accrued interest with respect to any period for such notes until after\nthe end of such period, which may adversely affect your ability to trade such\nnotes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the rate cut-offconvention or\npayment delay convention, or a series of simple average SOFR notes that employs a\nrate cut-offdate, pursuant to the formula used to determine compounded SOFR,\ncompounded SONIA, compounded CORRA, compounded AONIA or simple average SOFR, as\napplicable, for such notes for an applicable interest period, the applicable daily\nrate used in such calculation for any day from, and including, the rate cut-\noffdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment date (or maturity or\nredemption date, if applicable) will be such daily rate in respect of the relevant\nrate cut-offdate.\n\nThe formula used to determine the base rate for compounded notes using the payment\ndelay convention employs a rate cut-off date for the final interest period with\nrespect to any series of notes. In addition, the formula used to determine the\nbase rate for (i) any series of compounded notes for which the applicable\nsupplement specifies that the rate cut-off convention applies and (ii) any series\nof simple average SOFR notes for which the applicable supplement specifies that a\nrate\ncut-off date applies, may employ a rate cut-off date for each interest period with\nrespect to such series.\n\nFor the final interest period with respect to a series of compounded notes using\nthe payment delay convention, the applicable daily rate used\nin the calculation of compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, compounded CORRA or\ncompounded AONIA, as applicable, for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off\ndate to, but excluding, the maturity date or the\nredemption date, if applicable, will be the applicable daily rate in respect of\nthe rate cut-off date. The rate cut-off date will be (1) for compounded SOFR, two\nU.S. government securities business days (or such other number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement), (2) for\ncompounded SONIA, five London banking days (or such other number of London banking\ndays as we may specify in the applicable supplement), (3) for compounded CORRA,\ntwo Toronto banking days (or such other number of Toronto banking days as we may\nspecify in the applicable supplement), prior to the applicable maturity date (or\nredemption date, if applicable) or (4) for compounded AONIA, two Sydney banking\ndays (or such other number of Sydney banking days as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement), prior to the applicable maturity date (or redemption date,\nif\napplicable).\n\nFor each interest period with respect to (i) any series of compounded SOFR notes\nusing the rate cut-off convention and (ii) any series of simple average SOFR notes\nusing a rate cut-off date, the applicable daily rate used in the calculation of\ncompounded SOFR or\nsimple average SOFR, as\n\nS-19\n\napplicable, for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but\nexcluding, the relevant interest payment date or the maturity or redemption\ndate, if applicable, will be the applicable daily rate in respect of the rate cut-\noff date. The rate cut-off date will be (1) for compounded SOFR, five U.S.\ngovernment securities business days (or such other number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) or (2)\nfor simple average SOFR, two U.S. government securities business days (or such\nother\nnumber of U.S. government securities business days as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement), prior to each interest payment date or the maturity date\n(or redemption date, if applicable).\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, a holder of a series of compounded notes using the\npayment delay convention will not receive the benefit of any\nincrease in the level of SOFR, SONIA, CORRA or AONIA, as applicable, on any date\nsubsequent to the applicable rate cut-off date in connection with the\ndetermination of the interest payable with respect to the\nfinal interest period for such series of compounded notes using the payment delay\nconvention. A holder of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off convention or\nsimple average SOFR notes using a rate-cut off date will not receive the benefit\nof any increase in the level of SOFR on any date subsequent to the applicable rate\ncut-off date in connection with the\ndetermination of the interest payable with respect to each interest period for a\nseries of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off convention or simple\naverage SOFR notes using a rate cut-off date, which could reduce the amount of\ninterest that may be payable on the applicable series of notes.\n\nInvestors in a series of compounded notes using the payment delay convention will\nreceive payments of interest on a delayed basis.\n\nThe interest payment dates for any series of compounded notes using the payment\ndelay convention with respect to interest rate\ndetermination and interest payments will be two business days (or such other\nnumber of business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) after the\ninterest period demarcation date at the end of each interest period for such\nseries. This\nconvention differs from the interest payment convention that has been used\nhistorically for floating-rate notes with interest rates based on other benchmark\nor market rates, where interest typically has been paid on a fixed day that\nimmediately\nfollows the final day of the applicable interest period. As a result, investors in\na series of compounded notes using the payment delay convention will receive\npayments of interest on a delayed basis as compared to traditional floating-rate\nnotes\nwithout payment delay in which they previously may have invested.\n\nRisks Relating to USD Benchmark Transition Provisions\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to USD benchmark transition\nprovisions. You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks\nrelating to USD benchmark transition provisions before investing in any SOFR\nnotes. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR notes\u0094 mean a series of compounded\nSOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nThe selection of a USD Benchmark Replacement could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and related USD Benchmark Replacement Date\nhave occurred with respect to a series of SOFR notes, the applicable USD Benchmark\nReplacement will replace the then-current USD Benchmark (which will be a rate\nbased on SOFR at the original issue date of the relevant SOFR notes) for all\npurposes\nrelating to such SOFR notes. If a particular USD Benchmark Replacement or USD\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment cannot be determined, then the next-available USD\nBenchmark Replacement or USD Benchmark Replacement Adjustment will apply. These\nreplacement rates and adjustments may be selected or formulated by (i) the USD\nRelevant\n\nS-20\n\nGovernmental Body (such as the ARRC), (ii) the International Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation, Inc. (\u0093ISDA\u0094) or any successor thereto or (iii) in certain\ncircumstances, us or our\ndesignee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting with us.\n\nIn addition, the terms of the SOFR notes expressly authorize us or our\ndesignee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting with us, in connection\nwith a USD Benchmark Replacement to make USD Benchmark Replacement Conforming\nChanges with respect to, among other things, the determination of interest periods\nand the\ntiming and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and\nother administrative matters. The application of a USD Benchmark Replacement and\nUSD Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation of USD Benchmark\nReplacement\nConforming Changes, could result in adverse consequences to the interest rate or\namount of interest payable on the SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the\nreturn on, value of and market for such SOFR notes and the price at which\ninvestors may\nbe able to sell such SOFR notes.\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections with respect to the USD\nBenchmark Replacement\nand any USD Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, or the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of a USD Benchmark Transition Event, may require the exercise of\ndiscretion and the making of subjective judgments by\nus or our designee (after consulting with us). Any determination, decision or\nelection made by us or our designee pursuant to the USD benchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in this prospectus supplement will, if made by us, be made in\nour sole\ndiscretion and, if made by our designee, be made after consultation with us and,\nin each case, will become effective without consent from the investors in the\naffected SOFR notes or any other party.

For more\ninformation, see the\nNon-USD benchmark transition provisions set forth under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097Effect of a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and\nRelated Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or SONIA\u0094\nbelow.\n\nRisks Relating to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate and EURIBOR Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to the Euro Interbank\nOffered Rate (\u0093EURIBOR\u0094) and EURIBOR notes generally.You should carefully consider\nthe following discussion of risks before investing in EURIBOR notes.\n\nRegulation, reform and the actual or potential discontinuation of EURIBOR may\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for affected EURIBOR notes.\n\nPreviously, certain interest rates which are deemed to be \u0093benchmark\u0094 rates have\nbeen the subject\nof national, international and other regulatory guidance, reform and other\nactions. This has resulted in regulatory reform and changes to existing\nbenchmarks. Such reform of benchmarks includes the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (as\namended, the\n\u0093EU Benchmarks Regulation\u0094) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8\nJune 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial\ncontracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and\namending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, and\nthe EU Benchmarks Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the\nUK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the \u0093UK Benchmarks Regulation\u0094\nand, together with the EU Benchmarks Regulation, the \u0093Benchmarks Regulations\u0094),\nwhich apply to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a\nbenchmark and the use of a benchmark within the European Union (the\n\u0093EU\u0094) and the United Kingdom (the \u0093UK\u0094), respectively.\n\nAmong other things, the Benchmarks Regulations\n(i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-\nEU-based or non-UK based, to be subject to\nan equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain\nuses by EU and UK supervised entities, as applicable, of benchmarks of\nadministrators that are not authorized or registered (or if non EU-based or UK-\nbased, as applicable, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).\n\nThe Benchmarks Regulations could have a material impact on EURIBOR notes, in\nparticular, if the methodology or other terms of EURIBOR are\nchanged in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulations.\nSuch changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or\notherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of EURIBOR.\n\nS-23\n\nOn September 21, 2017, the European Central Bank announced that it would be part\nof a\nnew working group tasked with the identification and adoption of a \u0093risk free\novernight rate\u0094 to serve as a basis for an alternative to benchmarks used in a\nvariety of financial instruments and contracts used in the euro area. On\nSeptember 13, 2018, the working group on euro risk-free rates recommended the new\neuro short-term rate (\u0093\u0080STR\u0094) as the new risk free rate for the euro area. \u0080STR\nwas published for the first time on October 2, 2019. In\naddition, in response to regulatory scrutiny and applicable legal requirements,\nthe European Money Markets Institute (the \u0093EMMI\u0094), as administrator of EURIBOR,\nconducted a series of consultations on a proposed reformed hybrid methodology\nfor EURIBOR. In July 2019, EMMI published its EURIBOR Benchmark Statement setting\nforth its reformed hybrid methodology and received regulatory authorization for\nthe continued administration of EURIBOR. Although EURIBOR has been reformed in\norder to\ncomply with the terms of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, its future remains\nuncertain. It is not known how long EURIBOR will continue in its current form. Any\nof these developments could have a material adverse effect on the value and the\nreturn on\nEURIBOR notes.\n\nThe euro risk-free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of\nguiding principles and high level\nrecommendations for the fallback provisions in, among other things, new euro\ndenominated cash products (including floating-rate notes) referencing EURIBOR. The\nguiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference\nEURIBOR in\nrelevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to\nthe euro area financial system. On May 11, 2021, the euro risk-free rate working\ngroup published its recommendations on EURIBOR fallback trigger events and \u0080STR-\nbased fallback rates. \u0080STR has a different methodology and other important\ndifferences from EURIBOR and has little historical track record and may be subject\nto changes in its methodology.\n\nIn order to address the effect of any discontinuance of EURIBOR, EURIBOR notes\ninclude certain fallback provisions. With respect to any series\nof EURIBOR notes, if we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that\na Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and related Non-USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate\nhave occurred with respect to EURIBOR, the applicable Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement will replace EURIBOR for all purposes relating to such notes. See\n\u0093Risks Relating to\nNon-USD Benchmark Transition Provisions\u0094 above. This may, among other things,\nresult in the application of backward-looking \u0080STR compounded in arrears, whereas\nEURIBOR is expressed on the basis of a\nforward-looking term and includes a risk element based on interbank lending.\n\nIn the future, EURIBOR could be subject to further\nregulatory scrutiny, reform efforts and/or other actions. Any such regulatory\nscrutiny, reform efforts and/or other actions could increase the costs and risks\nof administering or otherwise participating in the setting of EURIBOR and\ncomplying with\napplicable regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of\ndiscouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to\nEURIBOR, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in EURIBOR or lead to\nthe\nelimination, discontinuance or obsolescence of EURIBOR. Following the\nimplementation of reforms, the manner of administration of EURIBOR may change,\nwith the result that EURIBOR may perform differently than in the past, or could be\neliminated or\ndiscontinued entirely, or there could be other consequences that cannot be\npredicted. Even prior to the implementation of any changes, uncertainty as to the\nnature of potential alternative reference rates and as to the nature and effect of\npotential\nchanges to EURIBOR may adversely affect EURIBOR during the term of a series of\nEURIBOR notes, as well as the value of, the return on and/or trading market for\nsuch series. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse\neffect on the\ninterest rate on, value of, return on and trading market for any EURIBOR notes.\n\nFurthermore, if EURIBOR is discontinued or ceases to be\npublished, there can be no assurances that we and other market participants will\nbe adequately prepared for such\n\nS-24\n\ndiscontinuance or cessation, which may have an unpredictable impact on contractual\nmechanics (including, but not limited to, the interest rate with respect to\nparticular series of EURIBOR notes),\namong other adverse consequences.\n\nRisks Relating to the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate and BBSW Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to the Bank Bill Swap\nReference Rate (\u0093BBSW\u0094) and BBSW notes generally. You should carefully consider\nthe following discussion of risks before investing in BBSW notes.\n\nRegulation, reform and the actual or potential discontinuation of BBSW may\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for affected BBSW notes.\n\nInterest rate\nbenchmarks, including BBSW, have been and continue to be the subject of regulatory\nguidance and proposals for reform in Australia and internationally. These reforms\nmay cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear\nentirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such\nconsequence as it relates to BBSW could have a material adverse effect on BBSW\nnotes. In Australia, examples of reforms that are already effective include the\nreplacement of\nthe Australian Financial Markets Association (\u0093AFMA\u0094) as BBSW administrator with\nthe Australian Securities Exchange, changes to the methodology for calculation of\nBBSW, and amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) made by the Treasury\nLaws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Act 2018 (Cth) which, among other things,\nenable the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (\u0093ASIC\u0094) to make rules\nrelating to the generation and administration of financial benchmarks. On\nJune 6, 2018, ASIC designated BBSW as a \u0093significant financial benchmark\u0094 and made\nthe ASIC Financial Benchmark (Administration) Rules 2018 and the ASIC Financial\nBenchmarks (Compelled) Rules 2018.\n\nAlthough many of the Australian reforms were designed to support the reliability\nand robustness of BBSW, it is not possible to predict with\ncertainty whether, and to what extent, BBSW will continue to be supported or the\nextent to which related regulations, rules, practices or methodologies may be\namended going forward. This may cause BBSW to perform differently than it has in\nthe past,\nand may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, it is\npossible that these changes could cause BBSW to cease to exist, to become\ncommercially or practically unworkable, or to become more or less volatile or\nliquid. Any such\nchanges could have a material adverse effect on the BBSW notes.\n\nIf a Temporary Disruption Event occurs with respect to BBSW, BBSW will be\ndetermined in accordance with alternative methods, and if a Permanent\nDiscontinuation Trigger and related Permanent Fallback Effective Date occur with\nrespect to BBSW, the Applicable Fallback Rate for BBSW may not be a suitable\nreplacement for BBSW.\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Reserve Bank of Australia (\u0093RBA\u0094) announced its\nrequirement that floating rate notes\nissued after December 1, 2022 referencing BBSW must contain at least one \u0093robust\u0094\nand \u0093reasonable and fair\u0094 fallback rate for BBSW if it permanently ceases to\nexist. The AFMA published the \u0093AFMA Fallback Language\nTemplate for Floating Rate Notes\u0094 on November 1, 2022 (the \u0093AFMA Market\nGuidelines\u0094) for voluntary use in contracts that reference BBSW to assist market\nparticipants to meet the requirements of the RBA\u0092s updated criteria.\nThe fallback provisions relating to BBSW included herein under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Floating Rate Notes\u0097Floating Rate Notes without Payment Delay\u0097Determination\nof Base Rates\u0097BBSW Notes\u0097BBSW Fallback\nProvisions\u0094 are based on the AFMA Market Guidelines (the \u0093BBSW Fallback\nProvisions\u0094). The BBSW Fallback Provisions distinguish between temporary and\npermanent triggers affecting BBSW. If a Temporary Disruption Trigger occurs in\nrespect of the\n\nS-25\n\nBBSW, the interest rate for any day on which that Temporary Disruption Trigger is\ncontinuing will be the interest rate determined, in the first instance, with\npreference given to the\nAdministrator Recommended Rate (which is a rate formally recommended for use as\nthe replacement for BBSW by the administrator of such rate). The second preference\nwill be given to the Supervisor Recommended Rate (which is a rate formally\nrecommended\nfor use as the replacement for BBSW by the supervisor of the administrator for\nBBSW). Finally, preference will be given to the Final Fallback Rate.\n\nThe terms of the BBSW notes provide for a waterfall of alternative rates to be\nused to determine the rate of interest on the BBSW notes if a\nPermanent Discontinuation Trigger and a related Permanent Fallback Effective Date\noccur with respect to BBSW. The first alternative rate to BBSW in the waterfall is\nthe AONIA Rate, which is equal to Compounded Daily AONIA plus the Adjustment\nSpread\n(each as defined in the BBSW Fallback Provisions). Investors should be aware that,\nwhile BBSW is a forward-looking term rate based on observed bid and offer rates\nfor Australian prime bank eligible securities (which rates may incorporate a\npremium\nfor credit risk), AONIA is an overnight, risk free cash rate and, if the AONIA\nRate is the Applicable Fallback Rate, will be applied to calculate interest by\ncompounding observed rates in arrear at or near the end of the applicable interest\nperiod\nand adding the Adjustment Spread (which may be positive or negative or zero). The\nsecond alternative rate to BBSW in the waterfall is the RBA Recommended Fallback\nRate, which is the rate (inclusive of any spreads or adjustments) recommended as\nthe\nreplacement for AONIA by the Reserve Bank of Australia and is applicable when a\npermanent Fallback Effective Date occurs with respect to AONIA. If the RBA\nRecommended Rate is not available at the time of a Permanent Discontinuation\nTrigger with\nrespect to AONIA and related Permanent Fallback Effective Date, or if an RBA\nRecommended Rate is available at such time and a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger\nand related Permanent Fallback Effective Date subsequently occur with respect to\nit, the\nnext alternative rate in the waterfall is the Final Fallback Rate, which is the\nrate determined by us or our designee (after consulting with us) as a commercially\nreasonable alternative for the Applicable Benchmark Rate taking into account all\navailable information that, in good faith, we or our designee (after consulting\nwith us) considers relevant, together with (without double counting) such spread\nadjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that is customarily\napplied to the relevant successor rate or alternative rate (as the case may be) in\ninternational debt capital markets transactions to produce an industry-accepted\nreplacement rate for AONIA-linked floating rate notes at such time. Uncertainty\nwith\nrespect to market conventions related to the calculation of these BBSW fallback\nrates and whether any alternative reference rate is a suitable replacement or\nsuccessor for BBSW may adversely affect the return on, value of and market for the\nBBSW\nnotes.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the characteristics of any of the alternative rates\nfor AONIA will be similar to those of BBSW, or\nthat any such alternative rate will produce the economic equivalent of BBSW as a\nreference rate for interest on an applicable series of BBSW notes. Although the\nBBSW Fallback Provisions provide for us or our designee (after consulting with us)\nto\nmake certain term and spread adjustments to the Applicable Fallback Rate in order\nto produce an industry-accepted replacement rate for BBSW, such adjustments will\nnot necessarily make the alternative rate equivalent to BBSW.\n\nIn addition to the spread adjustments that we or our designee (after consulting\nwith us) may make to an Applicable Fallback Rate, the terms of\nthe BBSW notes expressly authorize us or our designee, after consulting with us,\nin connection with implementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate to make certain\nchanges to the terms and provisions of the applicable series of BBSW notes with\nrespect\nto, among other things, the determination of interest periods and the timing and\nfrequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and other\nadministrative matters. The application of an Applicable Benchmark Rate, including\nany spread\nadjustment that may be\n\nS-26\n\nmade to such rate by us or our designee (after consulting with us), and any\nimplementation by us or our designee (after consulting with us) of any other\napplicable changes to the terms and\nprovisions of a series of BBSW notes in connection with the implementation of an\nApplicable Fallback Rate, could result in adverse consequences to the interest\nrate or the amount of interest payable on the notes, which could adversely affect\nthe\nreturn on, value of and market for such notes and the price at which investors may\nbe able to sell such notes.\n\nMoreover, certain\ndeterminations, decisions and elections with respect to the Applicable Fallback\nRate, any term or spread adjustments to the Applicable Fallback Rate, and any\nother changes to the terms and provisions of an applicable series of BBSW notes in\nconnection with the implementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate, or the\noccurrence or non-occurrence of a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger, may require\nthe exercise of discretion and the making of\nsubjective judgments by us or our designee (after consulting with us). Any\ndetermination, decision or election made by us or our designee pursuant to the\nBBSW Fallback Provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement will, if made by\nus, be made\nin our sole discretion and, if made by our designee, be made after consultation\nwith us and, in each case, will become effective without consent from the\ninvestors in the affected BBSW notes or any other party. We may designate an\nentity to make any\ndetermination, decision or election that we have the right to make in connection\nwith the BBSW Fallback Provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement. Any\ndesignee that we may appoint in connection with these determinations, decisions or\nelections may be our affiliate. When performing such functions, potential\nconflicts of interest may exist between us, our designee and investors in the BBSW\nnotes and making such potentially subjective determinations may adversely affect\nthe return\non, value of and market for the BBSW notes. All determinations by us or our\ndesignee in our or its discretion will be conclusive for all purposes and binding\non us and investors in the applicable BBSW notes absent manifest error.\n\nInvestors should consult their own independent advisors and make their own\nassessment about the potential risks imposed by BBSW reforms and\nthe potential for BBSW to be discontinued in making any investment decision with\nrespect to any BBSW notes.\n\nRisks Relating to the Floating-Rate Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the floating-rate notes generally.\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing\nin floating-rate notes.\n\nFloating-rate notes bear additional risks.\n\nFor notes that bear interest at a floating-rate, there will be additional\nsignificant risks not associated with a conventional fixed-rate debt\nsecurity. These risks include fluctuation of the interest rates and the\npossibility that investors will receive an amount of interest that is lower than\nexpected. We have no control over a number of matters, including economic,\nfinancial, and\npolitical events, that are important in determining the existence, magnitude, and\nlongevity of market volatility and other risks and their impact on the value of,\nor payments made on, floating-rate notes. Volatility of rates may adversely impact\nthe\nreturn on or market value of such floating-rate notes.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research reports that could affect the market\nvalue of the floating-rate notes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates, at present or in the future, may publish\nresearch reports with\nrespect to movements in interest rates generally or any base rate that may be used\nfor the floating-rate notes. This research may be modified from time to time\nwithout notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are\ninconsistent\nwith purchasing or holding the notes. Any of these activities could affect the\nmarket value of the floating-rate notes.\n\nS-27\n\nThe unavailability of certain base rates may result in the effective application\nof a fixed rate of interest for the applicable floating-rate notes.\n\nIn the event that any base rate described in this prospectus\nsupplement is unavailable on any date of determination, but the applicable\nprovisions for a replacement rate (if any) have not been triggered, the last\npublished level of the base rate or, the base rate for the previous interest\nperiod (depending on\nthe terms and conditions for the relevant base rate) will be used as the base rate\nfor such date of determination. In addition, because the federal funds (effective)\nrate, prime rate and treasury (auction) rate do not have provisions for a\nreplacement rate, the use of the final fallback provision will result in the\neffective application of a fixed rate of interest for the applicable floating-rate\nnotes. Furthermore, if AONIA, BBSW or EURIBOR is unavailable and the applicable\nprovisions for a replacement rate have been triggered, but a replacement rate\ncannot be determined under such provisions, then the last available rate will be\nused as the base rate under the final fallback provisions, which may result in the\neffective application of a fixed rate of interest for the applicable floating-rate\nnotes based on such last available rate.\n\nHistorical rates are not an indication of future rates.\n\nIn the past, the certain base rates that may be used for the floating-rate notes\nhave\nexperienced significant fluctuations. You should note that historical levels,\nfluctuations and trends of the base rates are not necessarily indicative of future\nlevels. Any historical upward or downward trend in the applicable base rate is not\nan\nindication that such base rate is more or less likely to increase or decrease at\nany time. Future levels of a base rate may bear little or no relation to the\nhistorical actual or historical indicative base rate data. Prior observed\npatterns, if any,\nin the behavior of market variables and their relation to the base rate, such as\ncorrelations, may change in the future. In addition, to the extent that any pre-\npublication historical data is published with\nrespect to a base rate, production of such historical indicative data inherently\ninvolves assumptions, estimates and approximations. No future performance of any\nbase rate may be inferred from any of the historical actual or historical\nindicative\nbase rate data.\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes with U.S. Treasury Rate as the Reset\nReference Rate\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-rate reset notes with the\nU.S. Treasury Rate as the reset reference rate. You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in fixed-rate reset notes with the\nU.S. Treasury Rate as the reset reference rate.\n\nThe value of and return on any fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset\nreference rate is the U.S. Treasury Rate may be adversely affected if the interest\nrate is determined using an alternative method or a replacement rate is used.\n\nUnder the circumstances\ndescribed herein under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset\nNotes\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate,\u0094 the interest\nrate for a series of fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset reference rate\nis the U.S. Treasury Rate will be determined using an alternative method to\ndetermine the applicable U.S. Treasury Rate or, if a rate substitution event has\noccurred with respect to the applicable U.S. Treasury Rate, using a replacement\nrate. If the\ninterest rate on such a series of notes is determined by using such an alternative\nmethod or replacement rate, such alternative method or replacement rate may result\nin an interest rate and interest payments that are lower than or that do not\notherwise correlate over time with the interest rate and interest payments that\nwould have been made on such notes if the reset reference rate had been determined\nusing the first method for determining the applicable U.S. Treasury Rate specified\nunder \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate.\u0094 If a rate substitution event has\n\nS-28\n\noccurred and it is determined there is no industry-accepted successor rate to the\napplicable U.S. Treasury Rate (or then-applicable replacement rate), the interest\nrate for the applicable reset\nperiod will be: (a) if the first reset interest rate is to be determined, the\ninitial interest rate or (b) if a subsequent reset interest rate is to be\ndetermined, the interest rate that was applicable for the preceding reset period.\n\nWe or our designee (after consulting with us) may make determinations with respect\nto the U.S. Treasury Rate that could affect the market value of your fixed-rate\nreset notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that the applicable\nU.S. Treasury\nRate cannot be determined in the manner set forth under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury\nRate,\u0094 the terms of the applicable fixed-rate reset notes\nexpressly authorize us or our designee, after consulting with us, to determine\nwhether there is an industry-accepted successor rate to the applicable U.S.\nTreasury Rate and, if applicable, to determine and make certain adjustments with\nrespect to\nsuch industry-accepted successor rate and the use thereof as the rate used to\ndetermine the interest rate on such fixed-rate reset notes. If we or our designee,\nafter consulting with us, determines that there is no such industry-accepted\nsuccessor\nrate, then the interest rate for the applicable reset period will be (a) if the\nfirst reset interest rate is to be determined, the initial interest rate or (b) if\na subsequent reset interest rate is to be determined, the interest rate that\nwas applicable for the preceding reset period, and such rate could remain in\neffect for so long as such fixed-rate reset notes are outstanding.\n\nCertain of these determinations, and other related determinations described in\nthis prospectus supplement, may require the exercise of\ndiscretion and the making of subjective judgments by us or our designee, after\nconsulting with us. In making these potentially subjective determinations, we or\nour designee may have economic interests that are adverse to interests of\ninvestors in\nfixed-rate reset notes, and such determinations may adversely affect the return\non, value of and market for the fixed-rate reset notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes with UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate as\nthe Reset Reference Rate\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-rate reset notes with the\nUK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate as the reset reference rate. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before investing in fixed-rate reset\nnotes with the UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate as the reset reference rate.\n\nThe selection of a Gilt Benchmark Replacement could adversely affect the return\non, value of or market for affected notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that a Gilt Benchmark\nTransition Event and\nrelated Gilt Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to a series of\nfixed-rate reset notes for which the reset reference rate is specified in the\napplicable supplement to be the UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate, the applicable\nGilt\nBenchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Gilt Benchmark for all\npurposes relating to such notes. If a particular Gilt Benchmark Replacement or\nGilt Benchmark Replacement Adjustment cannot be determined, then the next-\navailable Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement or Gilt Benchmark Replacement Adjustment will apply. These\nreplacement rates and adjustments may be selected or formulated by the Gilt\nRelevant Governmental Body or, in certain circumstances, us or our designee, after\nconsulting with us.\n\nS-29\n\nIn addition, the terms of fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset reference\nrate is\nspecified in the applicable supplement to be the UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate\nexpressly authorize us or our designee, after consulting with us, in connection\nwith implementation of a Gilt Benchmark Replacement to make Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement\nConforming Changes with respect to, among other things, the determination of\ninterest periods and the timing and frequency of determining rates and making\npayments of interest and other administrative matters. The application of a Gilt\nBenchmark\nReplacement and Gilt Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation of\nGilt Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, could result in adverse\nconsequences to the amount of interest payable on such notes, which could\nadversely affect the\ninterest rate, the return on, value of and market for such notes and the price at\nwhich investors may be able to sell such notes.\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections with respect to the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement and any Gilt Benchmark Replacement\nConforming Changes, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a Gilt Benchmark\nTransition Event, may require the exercise of discretion and the making of\nsubjective judgments by us or our designee, after\nconsulting with us. Any determination, decision or election made by us or our\ndesignee pursuant to the Gilt benchmark transition provisions set forth in this\nprospectus supplement under the heading \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate\nReset Notes\u0097Effect of a Gilt Transition Event and Related Gilt Replacement Date\u0094\nwill, if made by us, be made in our sole discretion and, if made by our designee,\nbe made after consultation with us and, in each case, will become effective\nwithout consent from the investors in the affected notes or any other party. We\nmay designate an entity to make any determination, decision or election that we\nhave the right to make in connection with the Gilt benchmark transition provisions\nset\nforth in this prospectus supplement. Any designee that we may appoint in\nconnection with these determinations, decisions or elections may be our affiliate.\nWhen performing such functions, potential conflicts of interest may exist between\nus or our\ndesignee and investors in the affected notes. All determinations by us or our\ndesignee in our or its discretion will be conclusive for all purposes and binding\non us and investors in the applicable notes absent manifest error. In making these\npotentially subjective determinations, we, or our designee may have economic\ninterests that are adverse to your interests, and such determinations may\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for the applicable notes.\n\nFurther, (i) the composition and characteristics of any Gilt Benchmark Replacement\nin respect of a series of affected notes will not be\nthe same as those of the applicable UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate, as applicable,\nthe Gilt Benchmark Replacement will not be the economic equivalent of the\napplicable UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate, there can be no assurance that the Gilt\nBenchmark\nReplacement will perform in the same way as the applicable UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate would have at any time and there is no guarantee that the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement will be a comparable substitute for the applicable UK\nGovernment Bond\n(Gilt) Rate (each of which means that a Gilt Benchmark Transition Event could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for the applicable series of\nnotes), (ii) any failure of the Gilt Benchmark Replacement to gain market\nacceptance could\nadversely affect the relevant series of notes, (iii) the Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement may have a very limited history and the future performance of the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement may not be able to be predicted based on historical\nperformance,\n(iv) the secondary trading market for debt securities linked to the Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement may be limited and (v) the administrator of the Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement, if applicable, may make changes that could change the value of the\nGilt Benchmark Replacement or discontinue the Gilt Benchmark Replacement and would\nnot have any obligation to consider the interests of investors in the relevant\nseries of notes in doing so. For more information, see the Gilt benchmark\ntransition\nprovisions set forth under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Effect\nof a Gilt Transition Event and Related Gilt Replacement Date\u0094 below in this\nprospectus supplement.\n\nS-30\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-rate reset notes generally.\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing\nin fixed-rate reset notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of fixed-rate reset notes will reset periodically\nand the subsequent interest rate may be lower than the interest rate for prior\ninterest periods.\n\nThe interest on a\nseries of fixed-rate reset notes will reset periodically and the interest or rate\nfor each interest period will equal the reset reference rate specified in the\napplicable supplement plus a spread, as applicable. Therefore, after the interest\nrate\nresets, the interest rate could be less than the fixed rate for the initial\ninterest period and any subsequent interest rate, if applicable, may be less than\na prior rate. We have no control over the factors that may affect interest rates,\nincluding\ngeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial\nor other events that may affect the market generally and interest rates\nspecifically.\n\nHistorical rates are not an indication of future rates.\n\nIn the past, certain reset reference rates that may be used for the fixed-rate\nreset notes have experienced significant fluctuations. You\nshould note that historical levels, fluctuations and trends of the reset reference\nrates are not necessarily indicative of future levels. Any historical upward or\ndownward trend in the applicable reset reference rate is not an indication that\nsuch\nreset reference rate is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time,\nand you should not take the historical reset reference rate levels as an\nindication of future levels.\n\nRisks Relating to Notes Denominated in a Currency Other than the Investor\u0092s Home\nCurrency\n\nWe may issue notes denominated in, or with respect to which principal, interest\nand/or other amounts payable are payable in, a currency other than the currency of\nthe country in which you reside or the currency in which you conduct your business\nor activities (the \u0093home currency\u0094). If you intend to invest in notes denominated\nor payable in a currency other than your home currency, you should consult your\nown financial and legal advisors as to the currency risks related to your\ninvestment. Such notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not\nknowledgeable about the significant terms and conditions of such notes, foreign\ncurrency transactions or financial matters in general.\n\nAn investment in a note denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency involves currency-related risks.\n\nAn investment in a note denominated or payable in a currency\nother than your home currency entails significant risks that are not associated\nwith a similar investment in a note that is payable solely in your home currency.\nThese risks include possible significant changes in rates of exchange between your\nhome\ncurrency and the applicable specified currency of the notes, and the imposition or\nmodification of foreign exchange controls or other conditions by applicable\ngovernmental entities. These risks generally depend on factors over which we have\nno\ncontrol, such as economic and political events and the supply of and demand for\nthe relevant currencies in the global markets.\n\nChanges in currency exchange rates can be volatile and may adversely affect an\ninvestment in a note denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency.\n\nIn recent years, exchange rates between certain foreign currencies have been\nhighly volatile. This volatility may continue and could spread to\nother currencies in the future. Fluctuations in\n\nS-31\n\ncurrency exchange rates could affect adversely an investment in a note denominated\nor payable in a currency other than your home currency, and such changes in\nexchange rates may vary considerably\nduring the life of that note. Depreciation of the applicable specified currency\nfor a series of notes against your home currency could result in a decrease in\nyour home currency equivalent value of payments on such notes, including the\nprincipal or\nother amounts payable at maturity or the redemption amount payable upon those\nnotes. That in turn could cause the market value such notes to fall.\n\nWe will not adjust notes denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency to compensate for changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nExcept as described below or in the applicable supplement, we will not make any\nadjustment in or change to the terms\nof notes denominated or payable in currencies other than your home currency for\nchanges in the foreign currency exchange rate for the relevant specified currency\nfor a series of notes, including any devaluation, revaluation, or imposition of\nexchange or other regulatory controls or taxes, or for other developments\naffecting that currency or any other currency. Consequently, you will bear the\nrisk that your investment may be affected adversely by these types of events.\n\nGovernment policy can adversely affect foreign currency exchange rates and an\ninvestment in a note denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates either can float or be fixed by sovereign\ngovernments. Governments or\ngovernmental bodies, including the European Central Bank, may intervene from time\nto time in their economies to alter the exchange rate or exchange characteristics\nof their currencies. For example, a central bank may intervene to devalue or\nrevalue\na currency or to replace an existing currency. In addition, a government may\nimpose regulatory controls or taxes to affect the exchange rate of its currency or\nmay issue a new currency or replace an existing currency. As a result, the amounts\npayable on and rate of return of a note denominated or payable in a currency other\nthan your home currency could be affected significantly and unpredictably by\ngovernmental actions. Even in the absence of governmental action directly\naffecting\ncurrency exchange rates, political or economic developments in the country or\nregion issuing the specified currency for an applicable series of notes or\nelsewhere could result in significant and sudden changes in the exchange rate\nbetween your home\ncurrency and specified currency. Changes in exchange rates could affect the value\nof notes denominated or payable in a currency other than your home currency as\nparticipants in the global currency markets move to buy or sell the specified\ncurrency\nor your home currency in reaction to these developments.\n\nIf a governmental authority imposes exchange controls or other conditions, such\nas taxes on the exchange or transfer of the specified currency, there may be\nlimited availability of the specified currency for payment on notes denominated or\npayable in a currency other than your home currency at their maturity or on any\nother\npayment date. In addition, the ability of a holder to move currency freely out of\nthe country in which payment in the currency is received or to convert the\ncurrency at a freely determined market rate could be limited by governmental\nactions.\n\nNotes denominated or payable in currencies other than U.S. dollars permit us to\nmake payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain the specified currency.\n\nThe terms of any series of notes denominated or payable in a currency other than\nU.S. dollars provide that we\nhave the right to make a payment in U.S. dollars instead of the specified\ncurrency, if at or about the time when the payment on such notes comes due, the\nspecified currency is subject to convertibility, transferability, market\ndisruption, or other\nconditions affecting its availability\n\nS-32\n\nbecause of circumstances beyond our control. These circumstances could include the\nimposition of exchange controls, our inability to obtain the specified currency\nbecause of a disruption in the\ncurrency markets for the specified currency, or unavailability because the\nspecified currency is no longer used by the government of the relevant country or\nfor settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the\ninternational banking\ncommunity. In addition, if the specified currency for a note has been replaced by\na new currency, we will have the option to choose whether we make payments on such\nnote in the replacement currency or in U.S. dollars. In either case, the exchange\nrate used to make payment in U.S. dollars or the replacement currency, if any, may\nbe based on limited information and would involve significant discretion on the\npart of the exchange rate agent, which may be one of our affiliates, to be\nappointed\nby us. As a result, the value of the payment in our home currency may be less than\nthe value of the payment you would have received in the specified currency if the\nspecified currency had been available. The exchange rate agent generally will not\nhave any liability for its determinations.\n\nSee \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other\nAmounts Payable\u0097Payments Due in Other Currencies\u0097Unavailability of Currencies and\nReplacement Currencies\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus. Any payment in respect of\nthe notes so made in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in an\nunavailable specified currency will not constitute an event of default under the\nrelevant indenture or the notes. If your home currency is not U.S. dollars, any\nsuch payment will expose you to the significant risks described above in this\nsection\n\u0093\u0097Risks Relating to Notes Denominated in a Currency Other Than an Investor\u0092s Home\nCurrency.\u0094\n\nAn investor may bear currency exchange risk in a lawsuit for payment on a note\ndenominated or payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars.\n\nAny notes\nissued under the Senior Indenture or the Subordinated Indenture will be governed\nby New York law. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in\nthe State of New York rendering a judgment on notes denominated or payable in a\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars and governed by New York law would be required to\nrender the judgment in such non-U.S. currency. In turn, the judgment would be\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for\npayment on notes denominated or payable in a non-U.S. currency and governed by New\nYork law, you would bear currency exchange\nrisk until judgment is entered, which could be a long time.\n\nIn courts outside of New York, you may not be able to obtain judgment in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in\nan action based on notes denominated or payable in a non-U.S. currency in many\nother U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily\nwould be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date and method\nused to determine the rate of conversion of the specified currency into U.S.\ndollars will depend on various factors, including which court renders the\njudgment.\n\nInformation about currency exchange rates may not be indicative of future\nperformance.\n\nIf we issue a note denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency, we may include in the applicable supplement information\nabout historical exchange rates for the relevant currency or currencies. Any\ninformation about exchange rates that we may provide will be furnished as a matter\nof information only, and you should not regard the information as indicative of\nthe range\nof, or trends in, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the\nfuture.\n\nS-33\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\n\nThis section describes general terms and provisions of the notes, which may be\nsenior or subordinated medium-term notes. This section supplements, and should be\nread together with, the general description of our debt securities, and the terms\nand provisions thereof, included in \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in\nthis prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, the information in\nthis prospectus supplement will supersede the information in the accompanying\nprospectus.\n\nThe terms and provisions of the notes set forth in this prospectus supplement will\napply to a series of notes, to the extent applicable as set forth below, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. If the applicable supplement for\na series of notes includes terms and provisions that modify, conflict with or\notherwise are inconsistent with the applicable terms and provisions set forth\nbelow, then, regardless of whether the applicable terms and provisions set forth\nbelow are stated to apply \u0093unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement,\u0094 such terms and provisions set forth in the applicable supplement\nshall govern and control with respect to such series of notes.\n\nCertain capitalized or other defined terms that are used in this section\n\u0093Description of the Notes\u0094 have the specific meanings set forth herein. A listing\nof the pages on which certain of such terms are defined can be found under the\n\u0093Index of Certain Defined Terms\u0094 beginning on page S-133 of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe will issue the notes as part of a series of debt securities under the Senior\nIndenture or the Subordinated Indenture, as applicable, which\nare contracts between us, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A., as trustee. In this prospectus supplement, we refer to The Bank of\nNew York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and any successor trustee under the Senior\nIndenture or the Subordinated Indenture, as applicable, as the \u0093trustee,\u0094 and we\nrefer to the Senior Indenture and the Subordinated Indenture, each as may be\nsupplemented from time to time, individually as an \u0093Indenture\u0094 and\ntogether as the \u0093Indentures.\u0094 In addition to the following summary of general\nterms of the notes and the Indentures, you should review the forms of the global\nnote certificates and the specific provisions of the Senior Indenture and the\nSubordinated Indenture, as applicable, which we have filed with the SEC.\n\nThe Indentures are subject to, and governed by, the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939.\n\nOur senior debt securities, which we refer to in this prospectus supplement as our\n\u0093senior notes,\u0094 will\nbe issued under the Senior Indenture and will rank equally in right of payment\nwith our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Our subordinated debt\nsecurities, which we refer to in this prospectus supplement as our \u0093subordinated\nnotes,\u0094 will be issued under the Subordinated Indenture and will be subordinate\nand junior in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness from time to time\noutstanding as provided in the Subordinated Indenture.\n\nWe and the selling agents, in the ordinary course of our respective businesses,\nhave conducted and may conduct business with the trustee or\nits affiliates. See \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097The Indentures\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus for more information about the Indentures and the\nfunctions of the trustee.\n\nThe notes are our direct unsecured obligations and are not obligations of our\nsubsidiaries. The Indentures do not limit the amount of\nindebtedness that we may incur. We may issue other debt securities under the\nIndentures from time to time in one or more series up to the aggregate principal\namount of the then-existing grant of authority by our board of directors.\n\nS-34\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable supplement, the minimum denomination\nof the\nnotes will be $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $1,000 (or the\nequivalent in other currencies).\n\nWe may issue the\nfollowing types of notes: fixed-rate notes, floating-rate notes, fixed/floating\nrate notes and fixed-rate reset notes. For more information on these types of\nnotes, see below under \u0093\u0097Fixed-Rate Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Fixed/Floating Rate Notes\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes.\u0094 In addition,\nwe may issue notes that do not bear interest.\n\nRanking\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to participate in any distribution of\nassets of any subsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of\ncreditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent we may ourselves be recognized\nas a creditor of that subsidiary. Accordingly, our obligations under senior notes\nor\nsubordinated notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future\nliabilities of our subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to our assets for\npayments on the notes. Further, creditors of our subsidiaries recapitalized\npursuant to\nour resolution plan generally would be entitled to payments of their claims from\nthe assets of the subsidiaries, including our contributed assets. In addition, any\nof our obligations under the senior notes and the subordinated notes will be\nunsecured and therefore in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding will effectively\nrank junior to our secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets\nsecuring such obligations. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Risks Relating to Regulatory\nResolution Strategies and Long-Term Debt Requirements,\u0094 \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Risks\nRelating to Debt Securities Generally\u0094 and \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Financial Consequences to the Unsecured Debtholders of Single Point\nof Enty Resolution Strategy\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nSenior Notes\n\nThe senior notes will be unsecured and will rank equally in right of payment with\nall our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations from\ntime to time outstanding, except obligations that are subject to any priorities or\npreferences by law.\n\nThe Senior Indenture and the\nsenior notes do not contain any limitation on the amount of obligations that we\nmay incur in the future.\n\nSubordinated Notes\n\nOur indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated notes, including the principal and\nany premium, interest, and other amounts\npayable, will be unsecured and will be subordinate and junior in right of payment\nto all of our senior indebtedness from time to time outstanding to the extent and\nin the manner provided in the Subordinated Indenture. The subordinated notes will\nrank equally in right of payment with all our other unsecured and subordinated\nindebtedness, other than unsecured and subordinated indebtedness that by its terms\nis subordinated to the subordinated notes. Due to differing subordination\nprovisions in\nvarious series of subordinated debt securities issued by us and our predecessors,\nin the event of a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization,\ninsolvency, receivership or other proceeding, investors in subordinated notes may\nreceive more\nor less, ratably, than investors in some other series of our outstanding\nsubordinated debt securities. Payment of principal of our subordinated\nindebtedness, including any subordinated notes, may not be accelerated if there is\na default in the\npayment of amounts payable under, or a default in any of our other covenants\napplicable to, our subordinated indebtedness.\n\nS-35\n\nThe Subordinated Indenture and the subordinated notes do not contain any\nlimitation on the\namount of obligations ranking senior to the subordinated notes, or the amount of\nobligations ranking equally with the subordinated notes, that we may incur in the\nfuture.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the subordinated notes\nwill not be guaranteed by us or any of our affiliates and\nwill not be subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances\nthe ranking of the subordinated notes. For more information about our subordinated\nnotes, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Subordination\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nFixed-Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that bear interest at a fixed rate as set forth in the\napplicable supplement, which we refer to as \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each fixed-rate\nnote will bear interest from its original issue date or from the most recent date\nto which interest on the note has been paid or made available for payment.\nInterest will accrue on the principal of a fixed-rate note at the fixed annual\nrate stated in the applicable supplement, until the principal is paid or made\navailable for payment.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will pay interest on\nany fixed-rate note quarterly, semiannually, or annually, as\napplicable, in arrears, on the days set forth in the applicable supplement (each\nsuch day being an \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for a fixed-rate note) and at the\nmaturity date or earlier redemption date, as applicable. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, each interest payment due on an interest\npayment date, the maturity date or earlier redemption date, as the case may be,\nwill include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent interest\npayment date\nto which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the\noriginal issue date, to, but excluding, the next interest payment date, the\nmaturity date or earlier redemption date, as the case may be (each such period, an\n\u0093interest\nperiod\u0094). The amount of accrued interest on a fixed-rate note for an interest\nperiod is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of such note by an\naccrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be determined by\nmultiplying\nthe per annum fixed interest rate by a factor resulting from the day count\nconvention that applies with respect to such determination. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, the factor resulting from the day count\nconvention will\nbe (a) with respect to fixed-rate notes denominated in U.S. dollars, computed on\nthe basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, which we may refer\nto as the \u009330/360\u0094 day count convention, (b) with respect to fixed-rate notes\ndenominated in Australian dollars, computed and paid on the basis of the actual\nnumber of days in the relevant period divided by 365, or if any portion of\nthe relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of (i) the actual number of days\nin that portion of the relevant period falling in a leap year divided by 366 and\n(ii) the actual number of days in that portion of the relevant period\nfalling in a non-leap year divided by 365, which we may refer to as the\n\u0093Actual/Actual\u0094 day count convention, (c) with respect to fixed-rate notes\ndenominated in pounds sterling or euro,\ncomputed on the basis of an Actual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of\nthe International Capital Markets Association) day count convention, which we may\nrefer to as the \u0093Actual/Actual (ICMA)\u0094 day count convention and (d) with\nrespect to fixed-rate notes denominated in Canadian dollars, computed on the basis\nof (i) the 30/360 day count convention when calculating interest for a full semi-\nannual interest period and (ii) the actual number of days in the relevant\nperiod divided by 365, when calculating interest for any period that is shorter\nthan a full semi-annual interest period, which we may refer to together as the\n\u0093Actual/Actual (Canadian Compound Method)\u0094 day count convention. We will make\npayments on fixed-rate notes as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0094 and in the accompanying prospectus under the\nheading \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\n\nS-36\n\nWe also may issue amortizing notes, which are fixed-rate notes for which combined\nprincipal and interest payments are made in installments over the life of the\nnote. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, payments on\namortizing notes are applied first to interest due and then to the reduction of\nthe unpaid principal amount, and the applicable supplement for an amortizing note\nwill include a table setting forth repayment information. Fixed/Floating Rate\nNotes We may issue notes with elements of each of the fixed-rate notes described\nabove and floating-rate notes described below. For example, a note may bear\ninterest at a fixed rate for some interest periods and at a floating rate for\nother interest periods. We will describe the determination of interest for any of\nthese notes in the applicable supplement. Floating-Rate Notes We may issue notes\nthat will bear interest at a floating interest rate determined in accordance with\nthe applicable terms and provisions set forth in this section and the applicable\nsupplement. We refer to these notes as \u0093floating-rate notes.\u0094 The terms and\nprovisions of floating-rate notes set forth in this prospectus supplement will\napply, to the extent applicable as set forth below, unless otherwise specified in\nthe applicable supplement. Overview of Base Rates and Floating-Rate Note\nProvisions The interest rate for each series of floating-rate notes will be\ndetermined by reference to a \u0093base rate\u0094 specified in the applicable supplement.\nThe \u0093base rate\u0094 for a floating-rate note will, if so specified in the applicable\nsupplement, be one or more of the following, or may be any other base rate as may\nbe specified in the applicable supplement:\n                                                                                  \n      the Australian dollar Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, in which case the      \n      note will be a \u0093BBSW note\u0094;                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the euro interbank offered rate, in which case the note will be a \u0093EURIBOR   \n      note\u0094;                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the federal funds (effective) rate, in which case the note will be a        \n      \u0093federal funds (effective) rate                                              \n      note\u0094;                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      the prime rate, in which case the note will be a \u0093prime rate note\u0094;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n      the treasury (auction) rate, in which case the note will be a \u0093treasury      \n      (auction) rate note\u0094;                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      compounded SOFR, calculated by reference to the Secured Overnight           \n      Financing Rate, in which case the note will be                              \n      a \u0093compounded SOFR note\u0094;                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      compounded SONIA, calculated by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index   \n      Average, in which case the note will be                                     \n      a \u0093compounded SONIA note\u0094;                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      compounded CORRA, calculated by reference to the Canadian Overnight Repo    \n      Rate Average, in which case the note                                        \n      will be a \u0093compounded CORRA note\u0094;                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      compounded AONIA, calculated by reference to the Australian dollar          \n      interbank overnight cash rate, in which case                                \n      the note will be a \u0093compounded AONIA note\u0094; and                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      simple average SOFR, calculated by reference to the Secured Overnight       \n      Financing Rate, in which case the note will                                 \n      be a \u0093simple average SOFR note.\u0094                                              \n                                                                                  \nS-37\n\nThe description of the terms and provisions of floating-rate notes in this\nprospectus supplement generally is divided into (i) a description of floating-rate\nnotes that use a \u0093payment delay convention\u0094 with respect to interest accrual and\npayment and (ii) a description of floating-rate notes that do not use such\nconvention, and is summarized as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      Floating-Rate Notes with Payment Delay.

The\n\u0093spread\u0094 is the number of basis points we may specify to be added to or subtracted\nfrom the applicable base rate. The \u0093spread multiplier\u0094 is the percentage (or\nnumber) we may specify by which the specified base rate is multiplied in order to\ncalculate the applicable interest rate. S-39\n\nThe interest rate for a series of notes also may be subject to (i) a maximum\ninterest\nrate limit, or ceiling, on the interest that may accrue during any interest or\nother applicable period; and/or (ii) a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on\nthe interest that may accrue during any interest or other applicable period.\n\nThe interest rate for a series of notes will be determined by reference to\ncompounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, compounded CORRA or compounded\nAONIA, calculated in respect of each interest period in accordance with the\nformula set forth under \u0093\u0097Determination of Compounded SOFR (Payment Delay),\u0094\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Compounded SONIA (Payment Delay),\u0094\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Compounded CORRA (Payment Delay)\u0094 or \u0093\u0097Determination of\nCompounded AONIA (Payment Delay)\u0094 below, and the terms and provisions of the notes\nset forth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect to SOFR\u0094\nor \u0093\u0097Effect of a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and Related Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or SONIA.\u0094\n\nWe will pay interest on a series of notes on each interest payment\ndate with respect to such series of notes. Each interest payment due on an\ninterest payment date, the maturity date or the redemption date, as applicable,\nwill include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent interest period\ndemarcation\ndate to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the\noriginal issue date, to, but excluding, the next interest period demarcation date\n(or, in the case of the final interest period, the maturity date or, if such notes\nare\nredeemed earlier, the redemption date) (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094 for\nsuch series of notes). The applicable supplement for a series of notes will\nspecify, among other terms and provisions, the \u0093interest period demarcation\ndates\u0094 with respect to such series.\n\nWe will pay interest on each series of notes in arrears, on the second business\nday (or such\nother number of business days we may specify in the applicable supplement)\nfollowing each interest period demarcation date (each such day being an \u0093interest\npayment date\u0094 for such notes); provided that the interest payment date with\nrespect to the final interest period for a series of notes will be the maturity\ndate for such series or, if the notes are redeemed earlier, the redemption date.\nOn each interest payment date, we will pay accrued interest for the most recently\ncompleted interest period.\n\nIf an interest period demarcation date other than the final interest period\ndemarcation date otherwise would\nfall on a day that is not a business day, then such interest period demarcation\ndate will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, except that, if the\nnext succeeding business day falls in the next calendar month, then such interest\nperiod demarcation date will be advanced to the immediately preceding day that is\na business day. If the scheduled final interest period demarcation date (which\nwill be the maturity date or, if we elect to redeem the notes earlier, the\nredemption\ndate) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal and\ninterest will be made on the next succeeding business day, and such final interest\nperiod demarcation date (and the related maturity date or redemption date falling\non\nsuch final interest period demarcation date) will be postponed to such succeeding\nbusiness day. In each case, the related interest periods also will be adjusted for\nnon-business days.\n\nWith respect to any series of fixed/floating rate notes for which compounded SOFR,\ncompounded SONIA, compounded CORRA or compounded AONIA is\nspecified to be the base rate for the applicable floating-rate period and for\nwhich the payment delay convention is specified to be applicable, notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in the applicable terms and provisions of the notes, and\nprovided that such series of notes is not redeemed prior to the commencement of\nthe floating-rate period, if the final interest payment date falling in the fixed-\nrate period otherwise would fall on a day that is not a business day, then such\ninterest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day,\nand the related interest period also will be adjusted for\n\nS-40\n\nnon-business days. If such final interest payment date during the fixed-rate\nperiod is so postponed, the first day of the initial interest period during\nthe floating-rate period will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, compounded\nCORRA or compounded AONIA, as applicable, the interest rate and accrued interest\nfor each interest period in arrears as soon as reasonably practicable on or after\nthe interest period demarcation date at the end of such interest period (or, in\nthe\ncase of the final interest period, the rate cut-off date) and prior to the\nrelevant interest payment date and will notify us of compounded SOFR, compounded\nSONIA, compounded CORRA or compounded AONIA, as\napplicable, and such interest rate and accrued interest for each interest period\nas soon as reasonably practicable after such determination, but in any event by\nthe business day immediately prior to the interest payment date.\n\nAll amounts resulting from any calculation on a note will be rounded to the\nnearest cent, in the case of U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, or\nto the nearest pence, in the case of pounds sterling, with one-half cent or pence,\nas applicable, being rounded upward. All percentages resulting from any\ncalculation with respect to a note will be rounded, if\nnecessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with five one-\nmillionths of a percentage point rounded upwards, e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545)\nbeing rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).\n\nDetermination of Compounded SOFR (Payment Delay)\n\nThe calculation agent will determine \u0093compounded SOFR\u0094 for a series of notes for\neach interest period in accordance with the formula\nset forth below. For purposes of calculating compounded SOFR in accordance with\nsuch formula with respect to the final interest period, SOFR for each U.S.\ngovernment securities business day in the period from, and including, the rate\ncut-off date to, but excluding, the maturity date or redemption date, as\napplicable, will be SOFR in respect of such rate cut-off date. The \u0093rate cut-off\ndate\u0094 will be the second U.S. government securities business day (or such other\nnumber of U.S. government securities business days as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement) prior to the maturity\ndate or the redemption date, as applicable.\n\nwhere:\n\n\u0093d\u0094, for any interest period, is the number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days in such interest period;\n\n\u0093i\u0094, for such interest period, is a series of whole numbers from one\nto d, each representing the relevant U.S. government securities business days in\nchronological order from, and including, the first U.S. government securities\nbusiness day in such\ninterest period;\n\n\u0093SOFRi\u0094 for any U.S. government\nsecurities business day \u0093i\u0094 in such interest period, is equal to SOFR in respect\nof that day, determined by the calculation agent; provided that, for purposes of\ncalculating compounded SOFR with respect to the final interest period,\nSOFR for each U.S. government securities business day in the period from, and\nincluding, the rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the maturity date or\nredemption date, as applicable, will be SOFR in respect of\nsuch rate cut-off date;\n\nS-41\n\n\u0093 n i\u0094 for U.S. government securities business day \u0093 i\u0094 in such interest period,\nis the number of calendar days from, and including, such U.S. government\nsecurities business day \u0093 i\u0094 to, but excluding, the following U.S. government\nsecurities business day; and \u0093 d\u0094 , for such interest period, is the number of\ncalendar days in such interest period. For purposes of the foregoing terms and\nprovisions, the following terms have the meanings set forth below: \u0093SOFR\u0094 means,\nwith respect to any U.S. government securities business day prior to a USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date:\n                                                                                  \n       the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published for such U.S. government    \n       securities business day as such rate                                       \n  (1)  appears on the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website at 3:00 p.m. (New York City     \n       time) on the immediately following U.S. government securities business     \n       day; or                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       if the rate specified in (1)\u00a0above does not so appear, the Secured         \n       Overnight Financing Rate as published                                      \n  (2)  in respect of the first preceding U.S. government securities business day  \n       for which the Secured Overnight Financing Rate was published on the SOFR   \n       Administrator\u0092s Website.                                                    \n                                                                                  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee, after consulting with us,\ndetermines that a USD Benchmark Transition Event and related USD Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred prior to the applicable USD Benchmark Reference\nTime in respect of any determination of SOFR on any date as described under\n\u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark Transition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to SOFR\u0094 below, then the USD benchmark transition provisions set\nforth under such heading will thereafter apply to all determinations of the\ninterest rate payable on the relevant notes. In accordance with the USD benchmark\ntransition provisions, after a USD Benchmark Transition Event and related USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred, the amount of interest that will be\npayable for each applicable interest period will be determined by reference to a\nper annum rate equal to the USD Benchmark Replacement plus or minus the spread, or\nmultiplied by the spread multiplier, as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Certain capitalized terms used in this paragraph have the meanings set\nforth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark Transition Event and Related USD Benchmark\nReplacement Date with Respect to SOFR.\u0094 \u0093SOFR Administrator\u0094 means the FRBNY (or a\nsuccessor administrator of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). \u0093SOFR\nAdministrator\u0092s Website\u0094 means the website of the FRBNY, or any successor source.\nThe information contained on such website is not part of this prospectus\nsupplement and is not incorporated in this prospectus supplement by reference.\nDetermination of Compounded SONIA (Payment Delay) The calculation agent will\ndetermine \u0093compounded SONIA\u0094 for a series of notes for each interest period in\naccordance with the formula set forth below. For purposes of calculating\ncompounded SONIA in accordance with such formula with respect to the final\ninterest period, SONIA for each London banking day in the period from, and\nincluding, the rate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the maturity date or redemption\ndate, as applicable, will be SONIA in respect of such rate cut-offdate. The \u0093rate\ncut-offdate\u0094 will be the fifth London banking day (or such other number S-42\n\nof London banking days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to\nthe maturity date or the redemption date, as applicable. where: \u0093 d 0\u0094, for any\ninterest period, is the number of London banking days in such interest period; \u0093\ni\u0094, for such interest period, is a series of whole numbers from one to d 0, each\nrepresenting the relevant London banking days in chronological order from, and\nincluding, the first London banking day in such interest period; \u0093 SONIA i\u0094 means,\nin relation to any London banking day \u0093 i\u0094 in such interest period, SONIA in\nrespect of that day, determined by the calculation agent; provided that, for\npurposes of calculating compounded SONIA with respect to the final interest\nperiod, SONIA for each London banking day in the period from, and including, the\nrate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the maturity date or redemption date, as\napplicable, will be SONIA in respect of such rate cut-offdate; \u0093 n i\u0094 means, in\nrelation to any London banking day \u0093 i\u0094 in such interest period, the number of\ncalendar days from, and including, such London banking day \u0093 i\u0094 to, but excluding,\nthe next following London banking day; and \u0093 d\u0094, for such interest period, is the\nnumber of calendar days in such interest period. For purposes of the foregoing\nterms and provisions, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:\n\u0093SONIA\u0093 means, in relation to any London banking day, the daily Sterling Overnight\nIndex Average rate for such London banking day as provided by the administrator of\nSONIA to authorized distributors and as then published on the SONIA Screen Page\nor, if the SONIA Screen Page is unavailable, as otherwise published by such\nauthorized distributors in each case at 12:00 p.m., London time, on the London\nbanking day immediately following such London banking day; provided that if, in\nrespect of any London banking day, the calculation agent determines that the SONIA\nrate is not available on the SONIA Screen Page or has not otherwise been published\nby the relevant authorized distributors, such SONIA rate shall be:\n                                                                                  \n       (i) the BoE\u0092s Bank Rate (the \u0093Bank Rate\u0094) prevailing at 5:00 p.m., London     \n       time (or, if earlier,                                                      \n       close of business) on the relevant London banking day; plus (ii)\u00a0the mean  \n       of the spread of the SONIA rate to the Bank Rate over the previous five    \n  (1)  days on which a SONIA rate has been published, excluding the highest       \n       spread (or, if there is more                                               \n       than one highest spread, one only of those highest spreads) and lowest     \n       spread (or, if there is more than one lowest spread, one only of those     \n       lowest spreads); or                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       if the Bank Rate is not published by the BoE at 5:00 p.m., London time     \n       (or, if earlier, close of business) on                                     \n       the relevant London banking day, the SONIA rate published on the SONIA     \n  (2)  Screen Page (or otherwise published by the relevant authorized             \n       distributors) for the first preceding London banking day on which the      \n       SONIA rate was published on the SONIA Screen                               \n       Page (or otherwise published by the relevant authorized distributors).     \n                                                                                  \nS-43\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee, after consulting with us,\ndetermines\nthat a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and related Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred prior to the applicable\nNon-USD Benchmark Reference Time in respect of any determination of SONIA on any\ndate as described under \u0093\u0097Effect of a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and\nRelated Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or SONIA\u0094\nbelow, then the Non-USD benchmark transition provisions set forth under such\nheading\nwill thereafter apply to all determinations of the interest rate payable on the\nrelevant notes. In accordance with the Non-USD benchmark transition provisions,\nafter a\nNon-USD Benchmark Transition Event and related Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Date\nhave occurred, the amount of interest that will be payable for each applicable\ninterest\nperiod will be determined by reference to a per annum rate equal to the Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement plus or minus the spread, or multiplied by the spread\nmultiplier, as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Certain capitalized terms used in this paragraph have the meanings set\nforth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and Related\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or SONIA.\u0094\n\nNotwithstanding the\nforegoing provisions, in the event the BoE publishes guidance as to (i) how SONIA\nis to be determined or (ii) any rate of interest that is to replace the SONIA\nrate, the calculation agent shall, in consultation with us, follow such\nguidance in order to determine the SONIA rate for so long as the SONIA rate is not\navailable or has not been published by the authorized distributors.\n\n\u0093SONIA Screen Page\u0094 means Reuters Screen SONIA Page or such other page, section or\nother part as may replace it as may be nominated\nby the person providing or sponsoring the information appearing there for the\npurpose of displaying rates or prices comparable to SONIA.\n\nDetermination of Compounded CORRA (Payment Delay)\n\nThe calculation agent will determine \u0093compounded CORRA\u0094 for a series of notes for\neach interest period in accordance with the\nformula set forth below. For purposes of calculating compounded CORRA in\naccordance with such formula with respect to the final interest period, CORRA for\neach Toronto banking day in the period from, and including, the rate cut-off date\nto, but excluding, the maturity date or redemption date, as applicable, will be\nCORRA in respect of such rate cut-off date.

General\nTerms and Provisions Applicable to the Notes Determination of Interest Rates The\ninterest rate for a floating-rate note will be determined by reference to:\n                                                                                  \n      the specified base rate (based on the specified index maturity, if          \n      applicable) for each interest or other                                      \n      applicable period determined in accordance with the applicable provisions   \n      set forth in this prospectus supplement and/or the applicable supplement;   \n                                                                                  \n                                                \n      plus or minus the spread, if any; and/or  \n                                                \n                                                    \n      multiplied by the spread multiplier, if any.  \n                                                    \nThe \u0093index maturity,\u0094 if applicable, is the period to maturity of the instrument\nfor which the base rate is calculated and will be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. The \u0093spread\u0094 is the number of basis points we may specify in the\napplicable supplement to be added to or subtracted from the applicable base rate.\nThe \u0093spread multiplier\u0094 is the percentage (or number) we may specify in the\napplicable supplement by which the specified base rate is multiplied in order to\ncalculate the applicable interest rate. Interest rates for a floating-rate note\nalso may be subject to:\n                                                                                  \n      a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, on the interest that may accrue  \n      during any interest or other                                                \n      applicable period; and/or                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on the interest that may accrue    \n      during any interest or other applicable                                     \n      period.                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAccrual of Interest, Interest Payment Dates and Interest Periods Each floating-\nrate note will accrue interest from its original issue date or from the most\nrecent date to which interest on the floating-rate note has been paid or made\navailable for payment. Interest will accrue on the principal amount of a floating-\nrate note at the applicable per annum floating interest rate until the principal\namount is paid or made available for payment. We will pay accrued interest on any\nfloating-rate note monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually (or for such other\nperiod as we may specify in the applicable supplement), as applicable, in arrears,\non the dates set forth in the applicable supplement (each such day being an\n\u0093interest payment date\u0094 for such floating-rate note) and at the maturity date or\nearlier redemption date, as applicable. Each S-52\n\ninterest payment due on an interest payment date, the maturity date or earlier\nredemption date, as the case may be, will include interest accrued from, and\nincluding, the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid,\nor, if no interest has been paid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding,\nthe next interest payment date or the maturity date or earlier redemption date, as\nthe case may be (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094). Interest payment dates\nand interest periods for floating-rate notes may be adjusted in accordance with\nthe business day convention (as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094) specified in the\napplicable supplement. Interest Reset Dates and Interest Determination Dates for\nIn Advance Base Rates The terms and provisions set forth below in this section\nwill apply to any series of notes for which the base rate is specified in the\napplicable supplement to be BBSW, EURIBOR, federal funds (effective) rate, prime\nrate, the treasury (auction) rate or any other base rate as may be specified in\nthe applicable supplement as an In Advance Base Rate, but will not apply to series\nof notes for which the base rate is specified in the applicable supplement to be\ncompounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, compounded CORRA, compounded AONIA or simple\naverage SOFR. The interest rate in effect from, and including, the original issue\ndate of a series of floating-rate notes to, but excluding, the first interest\nreset date for such notes will be the initial interest rate set forth in the\napplicable supplement or determined as set forth in the applicable supplement. The\ninterest rate of a series of floating-rate notes may be reset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, or at any other interval, as we\nspecify in the applicable supplement. If so specified in the applicable\nsupplement, a single interest period may contain multiple interest reset dates, in\nwhich case the interest rate with respect to the applicable series of notes will\nreset on each such interest reset date in accordance with the terms and provisions\nset forth in this section or as otherwise set forth in the applicable supplement,\nand interest will accrue on such series of notes at the interest rate in effect\nfrom time to time during such interest period. We refer to each date on which the\ninterest rate for a floating-rate note will reset as an \u0093interest reset date.\u0094 We\nwill specify the interest reset dates in the applicable supplement. Interest reset\ndates may be adjusted in accordance with the applicable business day convention\n(as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts\nPayable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094) specified in the applicable supplement. The\ncalculation agent will determine the interest rate for an interest period on the\ncorresponding interest determination date. The \u0093interest determination date\u0094 in\nrespect of any interest reset date is the day to which the calculation agent will\nrefer when determining the interest rate at which the applicable floating interest\nrate will reset. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\ninterest determination date for an interest reset date will be:\n                                                                       \n      for a BBSW note, the first day of the relevant interest period;  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n      for a EURIBOR note, the second TARGET Settlement Date preceding the         \n      interest reset date;                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for a federal funds (effective) rate note or a prime rate note, the         \n      business day immediately preceding the                                      \n      interest reset date;                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for a treasury (auction) rate note, the day of the week in which the        \n      interest reset date falls on which Treasury                                 \n      bills (as described below) would normally be auctioned; and                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for a floating-rate note with two or more base rates, the most recent       \n      business day that is at least two business                                  \n      days prior to the applicable interest reset date on which each applicable   \n      base rate is determinable.                                                  \n                                                                                  \nS-53\n\nWith respect to treasury (auction) rate notes, Treasury bills usually are sold at\nauction on\nMonday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction\nusually is held on the following Tuesday, except that the auction may be held on\nthe preceding Friday. If, as a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on\nthe\npreceding Friday, that preceding Friday will be the interest determination date\npertaining to the interest reset date occurring in the next succeeding week. The\ntreasury (auction) rate will be determined as of that date, and the applicable\ninterest\nrate will take effect on the applicable interest reset date. If Treasury bills are\nsold at an auction that falls on a day that is an interest reset date, that\ninterest reset date will be the next following business day unless we specify\notherwise in\nthe applicable supplement.\n\nIn determining the base rate that applies to a EURIBOR note or a treasury\n(auction) rate note during a\nparticular interest period, the calculation agent may obtain rate quotes from\nvarious banks or dealers active in the relevant market, as described below under\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Base Rates\u0094 and/or in the applicable supplement. Those\nreference banks and dealers may include the calculation agent itself and its\naffiliates, as well as any underwriter, dealer or agent participating in the\ndistribution of the relevant notes, and its affiliates, and they may include our\naffiliates.\n\nDetermination of Base Rates\n\nThe terms and provisions set forth below with respect to the determination of the\nbase rate for BBSW notes, EURIBOR notes, federal funds\n(effective) rate notes, prime rate notes, treasury (auction) rate notes,\ncompounded SOFR notes (other than compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention), compounded SONIA notes (other than compounded SONIA notes using the\npayment delay\nconvention), compounded CORRA notes (other than compounded CORRA notes using the\npayment delay convention), compounded AONIA notes (other than compounded AONIA\nnotes using the payment delay convention) and simple average SOFR notes will apply\nto\napplicable series of floating-rate notes.\n\nBBSW Notes\n\nBBSW, for any interest determination date, will mean the rate for prime bank\neligible securities having a tenor closest to the index maturity\nspecified in the applicable supplement which is designated as the \u0093AVG MID\u0094 on the\nRefinitiv Screen ASX29 Page or Bloomberg Screen BBSW Page (or any designation\nwhich replaces that designation on that page, or any replacement page, as\napplicable), or such other Relevant Screen Page as may be specified in the\napplicable supplement, at 12:00 Noon (Sydney time) (or any amended publication\ntime for the final intraday refix of such rate specified by the Administrator for\nBBSW in its\nbenchmark methodology) on the interest determination date.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the calculation agent determines that a\nTemporary Disruption Trigger has occurred with respect to BBSW as of any interest\ndetermination date, or if we or our designee (after consulting with us) determines\nthat a Permanent Discontinuation Trigger has occurred with respect to BBSW as of\nany\ninterest determination date, the provisions set forth below under \u0093\u0097BBSW Fallback\nProvisions\u0094 (the \u0093BBSW Fallback Provisions\u0094) will apply, in the order set forth\nbelow, with respect to an applicable series of BBSW notes. In\naddition, in connection with the implementation of an Applicable Fallback Rate\nfollowing a Permanent Fallback Effective Date, we or our designee (after\nconsulting with us) may make such changes or adjustments to (1) the Applicable\nFallback Rate\nor the spread thereon, (2) any interest determination date, interest payment date,\nother relevant date, business day convention or interest period, (3) the manner,\ntiming and frequency of determining rates and amounts of interest that are\npayable on the BBSW notes and the conventions relating to such determination, (4)\nthe timing and frequency of making payments of interest, (5) rounding conventions,\n(6) tenors, and (7) any other terms or provisions of the\nrelevant series of BBSW notes and related definitions, in each case that we or our\ndesignee\n\nS-54\n\n(after consulting with us) determines, from time to time, and notifies to the\ncalculation agent, to be reasonable to reflect the implementation of such\nApplicable Fallback Rate giving due consideration to any industry-accepted market\npractice for Australian-dollar denominated floating-rate notes.

This\naccrued interest factor will be determined by multiplying the per annum floating\ninterest rate determined by reference to the applicable base rate, as determined\nfor the applicable interest period, by a factor resulting from the day count\nconvention that applies with respect to such determination. The factor resulting\nfrom the day count convention will be, if so specified in the applicable\nsupplement, one of the following, or may be any other convention set forth in the\napplicable supplement:\n                                                                                  \n      a factor based on a 360-day year of twelve                                  \n      30-day months if the day count convention specified in the applicable       \n      supplement is \u009330/360\u0094;                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant interest        \n      period divided by 360 if the day count                                      \n      convention specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/360\u0094;            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant interest        \n      period divided by 365, or if any portion of                                 \n      that relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A)\u00a0the actual        \n      number of days in that portion of the relevant period falling in a leap     \n      year divided by 366 and (B)\u00a0the actual number of days in that portion of    \n      the relevant period                                                         \n      falling in a non-leap year divided by 365, if the day count convention      \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094; or                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant interest        \n      period divided by 365, if the day count                                     \n      convention specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed).\u0094    \n                                                                                  \nIf no day count convention is specified in the applicable supplement, the accrued\ninterest factor will be as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      for BBSW notes, compounded CORRA notes or compounded AONIA notes, the       \n      factor will be equal to the actual number                                   \n      of days in the relevant period divided by 365;                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for treasury (auction) rate notes and compounded SONIA notes, the factor    \n      will be equal to the actual number of                                       \n      days in the relevant period divided by 365 (or, if any portion of such      \n      relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of (a)\u00a0the actual number of   \n      days in that portion of such relevant period falling in a leap year,        \n      divided by 366 and                                                          \n      (b)\u00a0the actual number of days in that portion of such relevant period       \n      falling in a non-leap year, divided by 365); and                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for EURIBOR notes, federal funds (effective) rate notes, prime rate notes,  \n      compounded SOFR notes and simple                                            \n      average SOFR notes and any other floating-rate notes other than the types   \n      of notes specified in this bulleted list, the factor will be equal to the   \n      actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360.                \n                                                                                  \nOn or before the relevant \u0093calculation date,\u0094 the calculation agent will calculate\nthe amount of interest that has accrued during each interest period in accordance\nwith the provisions set forth above.

For any series of\nnotes for which S-83\n\nthe specified base rate is an In Advance Base Rate, the calculation date\npertaining to an interest payment date will be the earlier of:\n                                                                                  \n      the tenth calendar day after the applicable interest determination date     \n      for the interest period to which such                                       \n      interest payment date relates or, if that day is not a business day, the    \n      next succeeding business day; or                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the business day immediately preceding such interest payment date, the      \n      maturity date, or the date of redemption                                    \n      or prepayment, as the case may be.                                          \n                                                                                  \nAll amounts resulting from any calculation on floating-rate notes will be rounded\nto the nearest cent, in the case of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency other than U.S. dollars, with one-\nhalfcent or one-halfof a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded\nupward. All percentages resulting from any calculation with respect to a floating-\nrate note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of\na percent, with five one-millionthsof a percentage point rounded upwards, e.g.,\n9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). The interest\nrate on a note may not be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law,\nas that rate may be modified by U.S. law of general application. Under current New\nYork law, the maximum rate of interest, subject to some exceptions, for any loan\nin an amount less than $250,000 is 16% and for any loan in the amount of $250,000\nor more but less than $2,500,000 is 25% per annum on a simple interest basis.\nThese limits do not apply to loans of $2,500,000 or more to any one borrower. At\nthe request of a holder of any BBSW note, EURIBOR note, federal funds (effective)\nrate note, prime rate note or treasury (auction) rate note, the calculation agent\nwill provide the interest rate then in effect for that floating-rate note and, if\nalready determined, the interest rate that is to take effect on the next interest\nreset date. At the request of a holder of any compounded SOFR note, compounded\nSONIA note, compounded CORRA note, compounded AONIA note or simple average SOFR\nnote, the calculation agent will provide compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA,\ncompounded CORRA, compounded AONIA or simple average SOFR, as applicable, the\ninterest rate and the amount of interest accrued with respect to any interest\nperiod for such note, after compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, compounded CORRA,\ncompounded AONIA or simple average SOFR, as applicable, and such interest rate and\naccrued interest have been determined.

S-90\n\n\u0093Unadjusted Non-USD Benchmark Replacement\u0094\nmeans the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement excluding the Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement Adjustment.\n\nAdditional Information About SOFR\n\nAs further described in this prospectus supplement, the interest rate on\ncompounded SOFR notes and simple average SOFR notes will be\ndetermined by reference to a rate based on SOFR.\n\nIn general, the following discussion relating to SOFR is based on information\navailable\non the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website. SOFR is published by the FRBNY and is\nintended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. FRBNY reports that SOFR includes all\ntrades in the\nBroad General Collateral Rate, plus bilateral Treasury repurchase agreement\n(\u0093repo\u0094) transactions cleared through the delivery-versus-payment service offered\nby the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (the \u0093FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of\nThe Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). SOFR is filtered by FRBNY to\nremove a portion of the foregoing transactions considered to be \u0093specials.\u0094\nAccording to FRBNY, \u0093specials\u0094 are repos for\nspecific-issue collateral which take place at cash-lending rates below those for\ngeneral collateral repos because cash providers are willing to accept a lesser\nreturn on their cash in order to obtain a particular security.\n\nFRBNY reports that SOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-\nlevel tri-party repo\ndata collected from The Bank of New York Mellon, which currently acts as the\nclearing bank for the tri-party repo market, as well as General Collateral Finance\nRepo transaction data and data on bilateral U.S.\nTreasury repo transactions cleared through the FICC\u0092s delivery-versus-payment\nservice. FRBNY notes that it obtains information from DTCC Solutions LLC, an\naffiliate of DTCC.\n\nIf data for a given market segment were unavailable for any day, then the most\nrecently available data for that segment would be utilized,\nwith the rates on each transaction from that day adjusted to account for any\nchange in the level of market rates in that segment over the intervening period.\nSOFR would be calculated from this adjusted prior day\u0092s data for segments where\ncurrent data were unavailable, and unadjusted data for any segments where data\nwere available. To determine the change in the level of market rates over the\nintervening period for the missing market segment, the FRBNY would use information\ncollected\nthrough a daily survey conducted by its trading desk of primary dealers\u0092 repo\nborrowing activity. Such daily survey would include information reported by BofA\nSecurities, Inc., our affiliate, as a primary dealer. On June 3, 2019, FRBNY\nused this daily survey mechanism to calculate SOFR for May 31, 2019, when access\nwas disrupted to one of the three primary data sources used to calculate the SOFR.\n\nFRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on its website at\nhttps://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr. FRBNY states on its\npublication\npage for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations\nand indemnification obligations, including that FRBNY may alter the methods of\ncalculation, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR\nat any\ntime without notice.\n\nEach U.S. government securities business day, the FRBNY publishes SOFR on its\nwebsite at approximately 8:00 a.m.,\nNew York City time. If errors are discovered in the transaction data provided by\nThe Bank of New York Mellon or DTCC Solutions LLC, or in the calculation process,\nsubsequent to the initial publication of SOFR but on that same day, SOFR and the\naccompanying summary statistics may be republished at approximately 2:30 p.m., New\nYork City time. Additionally, if transaction data from The Bank of New York Mellon\nor DTCC Solutions LLC had previously not been available in time for publication,\nbut became available later in the day, the affected rate or rates may be\nrepublished at around this time. Rate revisions will only be effected\n\nS-91\n\non the same day as initial publication and will only be republished if the change\nin the rate exceeds one basis point. Any time a rate is revised, a footnote to the\nFRBNY\u0092s publication would\nindicate the revision. This revision threshold will be reviewed periodically by\nthe FRBNY and may be changed based on market conditions.\n\nSOFR is published by FRBNY based on data received from other sources, and we have\nno control over its determination, calculation or\npublication.\n\nFRBNY started publishing SOFR in April 2018. FRBNY also has published historical\nindicative Secured Overnight Financing\nRates dating back to 2014, although such historical indicative data inherently\ninvolves assumptions, estimates and approximations. Investors should not rely on\nsuch historical indicative data or on any historical changes or trends in SOFR as\nan\nindicator of the future performance of SOFR.\n\nNeither the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website, nor any of the information or materials\navailable thereon, are incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.\n\nNeither are we affiliated with FRBNY, nor does FRBNY\nsanction, endorse, or recommend any products or services offered by us.\n\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that will bear interest initially at a fixed interest rate for\na specified portion of the applicable term and then reset\nsuch fixed interest rate by reference to a \u0093reset reference rate\u0094 at one or more\nspecified intervals for the remainder of such term as determined in accordance\nwith the terms and provisions set forth in the applicable supplement and below\nin this prospectus supplement under \u0093\u0097Determination of Interest Rates for Fixed-\nRate Reset Notes\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates.\u0094 We refer to these\nnotes as \u0093fixed-rate reset notes.\u0094\n\nOverview of Interest Rates and Reset Reference Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\n\nEach fixed-rate reset note will bear interest from, and including, its original\nissue date to, but excluding, the \u0093first reset date\u0094\nspecified in the applicable supplement, at the rate per annum specified to be the\n\u0093initial interest rate\u0094 in the applicable supplement. The interest rate on any\nfixed-rate reset note will reset on the applicable first reset date and on any\napplicable subsequent reset date(s) specified in the applicable supplement, all in\naccordance with the terms and provisions of fixed-rate reset notes set forth below\nin this prospectus supplement under \u0093\u0097Determination of Interest Rates for\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes.\u0094 The interest rate to which any fixed-rate reset note\nresets on the first reset date and any applicable subsequent reset date(s) will be\ndetermined by reference to the reset reference rate plus the applicable\n\u0093spread,\u0094 if any, each as specified in the applicable supplement. The reset\nreference rate will be either the U.S. Treasury Rate or the UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate, as specified in the applicable supplement to be the reset reference\nrate and as determined in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth below\nin this prospectus supplement under \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates\u0097UK\nGovernment Bond (Gilt) Rate\u0094 or \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate,\u0094 as applicable.\n\nAccrual of Interest and Interest Payment Dates\n\nWe will pay interest on any fixed-rate reset note quarterly, semiannually, or\nannually, as applicable, in arrears, on the days set forth in\nthe applicable supplement (each such day being an \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for a\nfixed-rate reset note) and at the maturity date or earlier redemption date, as\napplicable. Each interest payment due on an interest payment date, the maturity\ndate or earlier redemption date, as applicable, will include interest accrued\nfrom, and including, the most\n\nS-92\n\nrecent interest payment date to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest\nhas been paid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding, the next interest\npayment date, the maturity date or earlier redemption date, as the case may be\n(each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094). The amount of accrued interest on any\nfixed-rate reset note for an interest period is calculated by multiplying the\nprincipal amount of such note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest\nfactor will be determined by multiplying the per annum fixed interest rate by a\nfactor resulting from the day count convention that applies with respect to such\ndetermination. The interest rate applicable with respect to any interest period\nfor any fixed-rate reset note will be the rate per annum determined in accordance\nwith the applicable terms and provisions set forth below under \u0093\u0097Determination of\nInterest Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset Reference\nRates.\u0094 If no day count convention is specified in the applicable supplement, the\naccrued interest factor will be as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      for fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset reference rate is specified  \n      in the applicable supplement to be the                                      \n      U.S. Treasury Rate, the factor will be computed on the basis of a 360-day   \n      year consisting of twelve 30-day months, which we may refer to as the       \n      \u009330/360\u0094 day                                                                  \n      count convention; and                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      for fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset reference rate is specified  \n      in the applicable supplement to be the                                      \n      UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate, the factor will be computed on the basis    \n      of an Actual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the               \n      International Capital Markets Association) day count convention, which we   \n      may refer to as the \u0093Actual/Actual                                           \n      (ICMA)\u0094 day count convention.                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe will make payments on fixed-rate reset notes as described below in this\nprospectus supplement under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts\nPayable\u0094 and in the accompanying prospectus under the heading \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\nDetermination of Interest Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset Notes Each fixed-rate reset\nnote will bear interest:\n                                                                                  \n       from, and including, the original issue date to, but excluding, the first  \n  (i)  reset date (such period, the                                               \n       \u0093initial fixed rate period\u0094) at a rate per annum equal to the initial        \n       interest rate;                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n        from, and including, the first reset date to, but excluding, the first    \n        \u0093subsequent reset date\u0093                                                     \n  (ii)  specified in the applicable supplement or, if no subsequent reset dates   \n        are specified in the applicable supplement, the maturity date or earlier  \n        redemption date, as the case may be, at a rate per annum equal to the     \n        first reset interest rate; and                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n         for each applicable subsequent reset period thereafter (if any), at a    \n  (iii)  rate per annum equal to the applicable                                   \n         subsequent reset interest rate,                                          \n                                                                                  \npayable, in each case, in arrears on each applicable interest payment date, the\nmaturity date or earlier redemption date, as the case may be.

For this purpose, a \u0093net payment\u0094 on such notes means a payment by us or\nany paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for\nany present or future tax, assessment, or other governmental charge of\ntheUnited States (other than a territory or possession).

If we may\nredeem the notes prior to their stated maturity date, the applicable supplement\nwill indicate the redemption price and method for redemption. See also\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Redemption\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.

In\naddition, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, to the extent\nthen\nrequired by applicable laws or regulations, the subordinated notes may not be\nredeemed prior to their stated maturity date without the requisite prior\napprovals, if any, from applicable regulators.\n\nS-107\n\nMake-Whole Redemption If we so specify in the applicable supplement, we may, at\nour option, redeem the notes of a series, in whole at any time, or in part from\ntime to time, on or after the date that is six months after the issue date for the\nnotes of such series as specified in the applicable supplement (or, if additional\nnotes of such series are issued after such issue date, then on or after the date\nthat is six months after the issue date of such additional notes) and prior to the\nlast day of the applicable \u0093remaining term\u0094 of the notes of such series, upon at\nleast five business days\u0092 but not more than sixty (60) calendar days\u0092 prior\nwritten notice to the holders of such notes, at the applicable \u0093make-whole\u0094\nredemption price.

The applicable supplement may set forth terms and provisions with\nrespect to a make-whole redemption applicable to notes denominated in a currency\nother than U.S. dollars, Canadian S-108\n\ndollars, Australian dollars or pounds sterling. Further, the applicable supplement\nmay set forth terms with respect to a make-whole redemption for notes denominated\nin a currency described above\nthat are different from or in addition to the terms set forth herein, in which\ncase the terms set forth in the applicable supplement will govern.\n\nUnless we default on payment of the applicable redemption price, interest will\ncease to accrue on the series of notes or portions thereof\ncalled for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If fewer than all of the\nnotes of any applicable series of notes are to be redeemed, for so long as such\nnotes are in book-entry only form, such notes to be redeemed will be selected in\naccordance

If we purchase notes in this manner, we have the discretion to\nhold, resell, or cancel any repurchased notes. The repurchase of any note that is\nour eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if after\nsuch\nrepurchase we would fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total\nloss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, to the extent then required by applicable laws or\nregulations,\nthe subordinated notes may not be repurchased prior to their stated maturity date\nwithout the requisite prior approvals, if any, from applicable regulators.\n\nForm, Exchange, Registration, and Transfer of Notes\n\nGlobal Notes\n\nWe\nwill issue each note in book-entry only form, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement. This means that we will not issue certificated notes in\ndefinitive form to each beneficial owner. Instead, the notes will be in the form\nof a\nglobal note, in fully registered form, registered and held in the name of the\napplicable depository or a nominee of that depository (or, in the case of notes\ncleared through Euroclear and Clearstream, a nominee of a common depositary or\ncommon\nsafekeeper for such depository).\n\nDepositories for Global Notes\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the depository for the\nnotes denominated in U.S. dollars will be DTC. Such notes\nwill be registered in the name of Cede & Co.\n\nS-113\n\n(DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may be requested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC and will be deposited with DTC.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the depository for notes\ndenominated in Canadian dollars will be CDS Clearing and\nDepository Services Inc. (\u0093CDS\u0094). Such notes will be issued as one or more\nregistered global notes initially registered in the name of CDS & CO., as nominee\nfor CDS, and deposited with CDS.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the depository for notes\ndenominated in Australian dollars, pounds sterling or euro\nwill be Euroclear and/or Clearstream. Such notes may be issued either under the\nNew Safekeeping Structure (the \u0093NSS\u0094) or the Classic Safekeeping Structure (the\n\u0093CSS\u0094). Notes issued under the NSS will be registered in the name of\na nominee of a common safekeeper for Euroclear and Clearstream. Notes issued under\nthe CSS will be registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for\nEuroclear and Clearstream. The notes will be deposited with such common safekeeper\nor\ncommon depositary, as applicable.\n\nIf we so specify in the applicable supplement, notes denominated in Australian\ndollars, pounds sterling\nor euro may be issued in the form of two global notes, each in fully registered\nform, one of which will be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and\ndeposited with its custodian, and one of which will be either (i) in the case of\nnotes\nissued under the NSS, registered in the name of a nominee of a common safekeeper\nfor Euroclear and Clearstream and deposited with such common safekeeper, or (ii)\nin the case of notes issued under the CSS, registered in the name of a nominee of\na common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and deposited with such common\ndepositary.\n\nDTC, CDS, Euroclear, and Clearstream, as\ndepositories for global securities, and some of their policies and procedures, are\ndescribed under \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0097Depositories for Global Securities\u0094\nin the accompanying prospectus. For more information about book-entry\nonly notes and the procedures for registration, settlement, exchange, and transfer\nof book-entry only notes, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Form and\nDenomination of Debt Securities\u0094 and \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0094 in\nthe accompanying prospectus.\n\nEurosystem Eligibility of Notes Issued Under Euroclear/Clearstream\u0092s New\nSafekeeping Structure\n\nThe European Central Bank (\u0093ECB\u0094) has announced that notes issued under the NSS\nwill be eligible as collateral for\nEurosystem credit operations (\u0093Eurosystem eligible\u0094), provided that certain other\ncriteria for such eligibility are met. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, notes issued under the NSS are intended to be Eurosystem\neligible, meaning that the notes are intended upon issuance to be deposited with\nan international central securities depository (\u0093ICSD\u0094) as common safekeeper, and\nregistered in the name of a nominee of an ICSD acting as common safekeeper\nfor Euroclear and Clearstream, and does not necessarily mean that the notes will\nbe recognized as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day\ncredit operations by the Eurosystem either\nupon issuance or at any or all times during their life. Such recognition will\ndepend upon the ECB being satisfied that Eurosystem eligibility criteria have been\nmet. The ECB has published on its webpage information on its collateral\neligibility\ncriteria. Among other criteria, the information published by the ECB indicates\nthat, effective as of February 8, 2018, unsecured debt instruments issued by\ncredit institutions, or their closely-linked entities, such as Bank of America\nCorporation, that are not established in the EU member states are not Eurosystem\neligible. Therefore, as of the date of this prospectus supplement, the notes will\nnot be recognized as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary and intra-day\ncredit operations. In addition, notes issued under the CSS will not be Eurosystem\neligible.\n\nS-114\n\nDefinitive Notes In the future, we may cancel a global note or we may issue\nsecurities initially in non-global,or definitive, form. We do not expect to\nexchange global securities for actual notes or certificates registered in the\nnames of the beneficial owners of the global securities representing the\nsecurities unless:\n                                                                                  \n      the depository notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as    \n      depository for the global securities, or                                    \n      the depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the          \n      Exchange Act or otherwise authorized under applicable law or regulation,    \n      and, in either case, we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90     \n      calendar days after receiving such                                          \n      notice or becoming aware of the foregoing;                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      after the original issue date of a series of notes, the depository and/or   \n      relevant clearing system has ceased to                                      \n      operate as such and no alternative depositary and/or clearing system        \n      approved by the applicable holders is available; or                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                    \n      we, in our sole discretion, elect to issue definitive notes.  \n                                                                    \nIf we ever issue notes in definitive form, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, those notes will be in registered form, and the exchange,\nregistration, or transfer of those notes will be governed by the applicable\nIndenture and the procedures described under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Exchange, Registration, and Transfer\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\nS-115\n\nU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nFor the material U.S. federal income tax considerations of the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of certain notes, see \u0093U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u0094 on page 108 of the accompanying prospectus and the\nsection \u0093\u0097Taxation of Debt Securities\u0094 of that section. Special U.S. federal\nincome tax rules are applicable to certain types of notes we may issue\nunder this prospectus supplement. The material U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations with respect to any notes we issue, and which are not addressed in\nthe accompanying prospectus, will be discussed in the applicable supplement.\n\nYou should consult with your own tax advisor before investing in the notes.\n\nS-116\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\n\nWe are offering the notes for sale on a continuing basis through the selling\nagents. The selling agents may act either on a principal\nbasis or on an agency basis. We may offer the notes at varying prices relating to\nprevailing market prices at the time of resale, as determined by the selling\nagents, or, if so specified in the applicable supplement, for resale at a fixed\npublic\noffering price. The applicable supplement will set forth the initial price for the\nnotes, or whether they will be sold at varying prices.\n\nIf we sell notes on an agency basis, we will pay a commission to the selling agent\nto be negotiated at the time of sale. The commission will\nbe determined at the time of sale and will be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Each selling agent will use its reasonable best efforts when we\nrequest it to solicit purchases of the notes as our agent.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed and specified in the applicable supplement, if notes are\nsold to a selling agent acting as principal, for its own\naccount, or for resale to one or more investors or other purchasers, including\nother broker-dealers, then any notes so sold will be purchased by that selling\nagent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes less a\ncommission that\nwill be a percentage of the principal amount determined as described above. Notes\nsold in this manner may be resold by the selling agent to investors and other\npurchasers from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated\ntransactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at\nthe time of sale, or the notes may be resold to other dealers for resale to\ninvestors. The selling agents may allow any portion of the discount received in\nconnection\nwith the purchase from us to the dealers, but the discount allowed to any dealer\nwill not be in excess of the discount to be received by the selling agent from us.\nAfter the initial public offering of notes, the selling agent may change the\npublic\noffering price or the discount allowed to dealers.\n\nWe also may sell notes directly to investors, without the involvement of any\nselling\nagent. In this case, we would not be obligated to pay any commission or discount\nin connection with the sale, and we would receive 100% of the principal amount of\nthe notes so sold, unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement.\n\nWe will name any selling agents or other persons through which we sell any notes,\nas well as any commissions or discounts payable to those\nselling agents or other persons, in the applicable supplement. As of the date of\nthis prospectus supplement, our selling agent is BofA Securities, Inc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094).\nWe will enter into a distribution agreement with BofAS that describes the\noffering of notes by them as our agent and as our principal. The form of\ndistribution agreement was filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of\nwhich this prospectus supplement forms a part. We also may accept offers to\npurchase notes\nthrough additional selling agents on substantially the same terms and conditions,\nincluding commissions, as would apply to purchases through BofAS under the\ndistribution agreement. BofAS may assign its rights under the distribution\nagreement to\nanother one of our broker-dealer affiliates under the circumstances set forth in\nthe distribution agreement. If a selling agent purchases notes as principal, that\nselling agent usually will be required to enter into a separate purchase agreement\nfor\nthe notes, and may be referred to in that purchase agreement and the applicable\nsupplement, along with any other selling agents, as an \u0093underwriter.\u0094\n\nWe have the right to withdraw, cancel, or modify the offer made by this prospectus\nsupplement without notice. We will have the sole right to\naccept offers to purchase notes, and we, in our absolute discretion, may reject\nany proposed purchase of notes in whole or in part. Each selling agent will have\nthe right, in its reasonable discretion, to reject in whole or in part any\nproposed\npurchase of notes through that selling agent.\n\nS-117\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the obligations of the\nselling agents under the distribution agreement, including any agreement to\npurchase notes, will be several and not joint. With respect to any offering of\nnotes, the selling agents will offer the notes subject to prior sale, when, as and\nif issued and accepted by them, subject to the satisfaction of conditions\ndescribed in the distribution agreement and any other agreement between us and the\nselling agents, including any terms agreement. Any selling agent participating in\nthe distribution of the notes may be considered to be an underwriter, as that term\nis defined in the Securities Act. We have agreed to indemnify each selling agent\nand certain other persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under\nthe Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the selling agents may be\nrequired to make. We also have agreed to reimburse the selling agents for certain\nexpenses. The notes will not have an established trading market when issued, and\nwe do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange, unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable supplement. Any selling agent may purchase and sell\nnotes in the secondary market from time to time. However, no selling agent is\nobligated to do so, and any selling agent may discontinue making a market in the\nnotes at any time without notice. There is no assurance that there will be a\nsecondary market for any of the notes. To facilitate offerings of the notes by a\nselling agent that purchases notes as principal, and in accordance with industry\npractice, selling agents may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or\notherwise affect the market price of the notes. Those transactions may include\noverallotment, entering stabilizing bids, effecting syndicate-covering\ntransactions, and imposing penalty bids to reclaim selling concessions allowed to\na member of the syndicate or to a dealer, as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      An overallotment in connection with an offering creates a short position    \n      in the offered securities for the                                           \n      selling agent\u0092s own account.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      A selling agent may place a stabilizing bid to purchase a note for the      \n      purpose of pegging, fixing, or maintaining                                  \n      the price of that note.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Selling agents may engage in syndicate-covering transactions to cover       \n      overallotments or to stabilize the price of                                 \n      the notes by bidding for, and purchasing, the notes or any other            \n      securities in the open market in order to reduce a short position created   \n      in connection with the offering.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      The selling agent that serves as syndicate manager may impose a penalty     \n      bid on a syndicate member to reclaim a                                      \n      selling concession in connection with an offering when offered securities   \n      originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in                    \n      syndicate-covering transactions, in stabilization transactions, or          \n      otherwise.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nIn connection with any offering of the notes, we may appoint a \u0093stabilizing\nmanager,\u0094 in which case the stabilizing manager will be identified in the\napplicable supplement. The stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its behalf),\nif any, may over allot notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the\nmarket price of the applicable notes during the stabilization period at a level\nhigher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilization action may\nnot necessarily occur. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on\nwhich adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the applicable\nseries of notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end\nno later than 30 days after the date on which we receive the proceeds of the\napplicable offering of notes, or no later than 60 days after the date of allotment\nof the applicable series of notes, whichever is the earlier. Any stabilization\naction or over allotment must be S-118\n\nconducted by the stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its behalf) in\naccordance with all applicable laws and rules and will be undertaken at the\noffices of the stabilizing manager (or\npersons acting on its behalf) and, if applicable, on the applicable securities\nexchange on which the applicable series of notes is listed (if any).\n\nAny of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the\nsecurities above independent market levels. The selling agents are\nnot required to engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities at\nany time. The stabilizing manager (if any) may conduct these activities in the\nover-the-counter market or otherwise. If the stabilizing manager (if any)\ncommences any of these transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.\n\nBofAS, a selling agent and one of our affiliates, is a broker-dealer and member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or\n\u0093FINRA.\u0094 Each initial offering and any remarketing of notes involving any of our\nbroker-dealer affiliates, including BofAS, will be conducted in compliance with\nthe requirements of FINRA Rule 5121 regarding a FINRA member firm\u0092s offer\nand sale of securities of an affiliate. None of our broker-dealer affiliates that\nis a FINRA member will execute a transaction in the notes in a discretionary\naccount without specific prior written approval of the customer. For more\ninformation, see\n\u0093Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)\u0097Conflicts of Interest\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nFollowing the initial\ndistribution of any notes, our broker-dealer affiliates, including BofAS, may buy\nand sell the notes in market-making transactions as part of their business as a\nbroker-dealer. Resales of this kind may occur in the open market or may be\nprivately\nnegotiated at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. Notes may be sold in\nconnection with a remarketing after their purchase by one or more firms. Any of\nour affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions.\n\nThis prospectus supplement may be used by one or more of our affiliates in\nconnection with offers and sales related to market-making\ntransactions in the notes, including block positioning and block trades, to the\nextent permitted by applicable law. Any of our affiliates may act as principal or\nagent in these transactions.\n\nNotes sold in market-making transactions include notes issued after the date of\nthis prospectus supplement as well as previously-issued\nsecurities. Information about the trade and settlement dates, as well as the\npurchase price, for a market-making transaction will be provided to the purchaser\nin a separate confirmation of sale. Unless we or one of our selling agents informs\nyou in\nthe confirmation of sale that notes are being purchased in an original offering\nand sale, you may assume that you are purchasing the notes in a market-making\ntransaction.\n\nBofAS and other selling agents that we may name in the future, or their\naffiliates, have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment\nbanking, commercial banking, and financial advisory transactions with us and our\naffiliates. These transactions are in the ordinary course of business for the\nselling agents and us and our respective affiliates. In these transactions, the\nselling\nagents or their affiliates receive customary fees and expenses.\n\nDelivery of the securities will be made against payment therefor on or\nabout the issue date specified in the applicable pricing supplement. Under Rule\n15c6-1 of the Exchange Act trades in the secondary market generally are required\nto settle in two business days after the date\nthe securities are priced, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree\notherwise. Effective on May 28, 2024 (the \u0093settlement cycle effective date\u0094), the\nstandard settlement cycle under Rule\n15c6-1 will be shortened from two business days to one business day. Accordingly,\nif the applicable pricing supplement specifies that the issue date is more than\ntwo business days (or, on or after the\nsettlement cycle effective date, one business day) after the date on which the\nsecurities are priced,\n\nS-119\n\npurchasers who wish to trade such securities at any time prior to the second\nbusiness day (or, on or after the settlement cycle effective date, the first\nbusiness day) preceding the issue date will be required, by virtue of the fact\nthat the securities will not settle in T+2 (or, on or after the settlement cycle\neffective date, T+1), to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of\nany such trade to prevent a failed settlement; such purchasers should also consult\ntheir own advisors in this regard.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the\nSecurities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of\na Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, such Registrant\nhas been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by a Registrant for expenses incurred or paid\nby a director, officer, or controlling person in the successful defense of any\naction, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling\nperson in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will,\nunless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling\nprecedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such\nindemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act\nand will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
