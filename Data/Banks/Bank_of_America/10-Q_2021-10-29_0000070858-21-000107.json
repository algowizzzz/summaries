Additionally, as\npart of this transition\nprogram, the Corporation\ncontinues to decrease\ninitiation of new U.S.\ndollar (USD) LIBOR-\nlinked consumer and\ncommercial loans that\nmature after June 30,\n2023, subject to certain\nexceptions, and\ncontinues to increase\nthe usage of ARRs in its\nUSD consumer and\ncommercial lending\nproducts and contracts.\nAs previously disclosed,\nthe Corporation has\nceased initiation of GBP\nLIBOR-linked\nderivatives, subject to\ncertain exceptions, and\nis prioritizing\ninterdealer trading in\nthe Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR)\nrather than LIBOR for\ncertain USD interest\nrate swaps in accordance\nwith recommendations by\nthe Commodity\n\nFutures Trading\nCommission (CFTC).

The increase in\nnet income was due to\nimprovement in the\nprovision for credit\nlosses and higher\nrevenue, partially\noffset by higher\nnoninterest expense.\n\nTotal assets increased\n$265.8 billion from\nDecember 31, 2020 to\n$3.1 trillion primarily\ndue to the deployment of\ncash from continued\ndeposit inflows into\ndebt securities, as well\nas higher trading\naccount assets due to an\nincrease in inventory in\nGlobal Markets.\n\nTotal liabilities\nincreased $266.3 billion\nfrom December 31, 2020\nto $2.8 trillion\nprimarily driven by an\nincrease in deposits due\nto continued government\nstimulus measures as\nwell as seasonally\nhigher deposits, an\nincrease in trading\naccount liabilities\nresulting from higher\nlevels of short\npositions in Global\nMarkets and higher\nfederal funds purchased\nand securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to\nrepurchase due to client\nactivity in Global\nMarkets .\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity\ndecreased $460 million\nfrom December 31, 2020\nprimarily due to returns\nof capital to\nshareholders\n\nthrough common stock\nrepurchases and common\nand preferred stock\ndividends, as well as\nmarket value decreases\non debt securities and\nderivatives, partially\noffset by net income.\n                                                 \n  Net Interest Income                            \n                                                 \nNet interest income\nincreased $965 million\nto $11.1 billion, and\ndecreased $1.6 billion\nto $31.5 billion for the\nthree and nine months\nended September 30, 2021\ncompared to the same\nperiods in 2020. Net\ninterest yield on a\nfully taxable-equivalent\n(FTE) basis decreased 4\nbasis points (bps) to\n1.68 percent, and 30 bps\nto 1.66 percent for the\nsame periods. The\nincrease in net interest\nincome for the three-\nmonth period was\nprimarily due to deposit\ngrowth and related\ninvestment of liquidity\nand the accelerated\nrecognition of\ncapitalized loan fees\ndue to PPP loan\nforgiveness, partially\noffset by lower loan\nbalances. The decrease\nin the nine-month period\nwas primarily driven by\nlower interest rates and\nloan balances, partially\noffset by higher\nbalances of debt\nsecurities.

Also included in\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 was\nthe impact of the 2021\nU.K. tax law change\nfurther discussed in\nthis section. Our\nrecurring tax preference\nbenefits primarily\nconsist of tax credits\nfrom ESG investments in\naffordable housing and\nrenewable energy,\naligning with our\nresponsible growth\nstrategy to address\nglobal sustainability\nchallenges. Absent these\ntax credits and the\nimpact of the U.K. tax\nlaw changes, the\neffective tax rate would\nhave been approximately\n25 percent for the three\nand nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\ncompared to 27 percent\nand 26 percent for the\nsame periods a year ago.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the\nU.K. enacted the 2021\nFinance Act, which\nincluded an increase in\nthe U.K. corporation\nincome tax rate to 25\npercent from 19 percent.\nThis change is effective\nApril 1, 2023 and\nunfavorably affects\nincome tax expense on\nfuture U.K. earnings. As\na result, during the\nnine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, the\nCorporation recorded a\nwrite-up of U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets of\napproximately $2.0\nbillion, with a\ncorresponding positive\nincome tax adjustment.\nThis write-up is a\nreversal of previously\nrecorded write-downs of\nnet deferred tax assets\nfor prior changes in the\nU.K. corporation income\ntax rate.\n                                                 \n  Bank of America6                               \n                                                 \n                                                 \n   Supplemental Financial Data                   \n                                                 \n                                                 \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                   \n                                                 \nIn this Form 10-Q, we\npresent certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Non-\nGAAP financial measures\nexclude certain items or\notherwise include\ncomponents that differ\nfrom the most directly\ncomparable measures\ncalculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are\nprovided as additional\nuseful information to\nassess our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations (including\nperiod-to-period\noperating performance)\nor compliance with\nprospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-\nGAAP financial measures\nare not intended as a\nsubstitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and\nmay not be defined or\ncalculated the same way\nas non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other\ncompanies.\n\nWe view net interest\nincome and related\nratios and analyses on\nan FTE basis, which when\npresented on a\nconsolidated basis are\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures. To derive the\nFTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to\nreflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent\nbefore-tax basis with a\ncorresponding increase\nin income tax expense.\nFor purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the\nfederal statutory tax\nrate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax\nrate. Net interest\nyield, which measures\nthe basis points we earn\nover the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest\nincome on an FTE basis.\nWe believe that\npresentation of these\nitems on an FTE basis\nallows for comparison of\namounts from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt\nsources and is\nconsistent with industry\npractices.\n\nWe may present certain\nkey performance\nindicators and ratios\nexcluding certain items\n(e.g., debit valuation\nadjustment (DVA) gains\n(losses)) which result\nin non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. We believe\nthat the presentation of\nmeasures that exclude\nthese items is useful\nbecause such measures\nprovide additional\ninformation to assess\nthe underlying\noperational performance\nand trends of our\nbusinesses and to allow\nbetter comparison of\nperiod-to-period\noperating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our\nbusiness based on\ncertain ratios that\nutilize tangible equity,\na non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. Tangible equity\nrepresents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and\nintangible assets\n(excluding mortgage\nservicing rights\n(MSRs)), net of related\ndeferred tax liabilities\n(\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or\ncommon shareholders\u2019\nequity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our\nuse of equity. In\naddition, profitability,\nrelationship and\ninvestment models use\nboth return on average\ntangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on\naverage tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as\nkey measures to support\nour overall growth\nobjectives. These ratios\nare as follows:\n\n\u25cf Return on average\ntangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nmeasures our net income\napplicable to common\nshareholders as a\npercentage of adjusted\naverage common\nshareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe tangible common\nequity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total\ntangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average\ntangible shareholders\u2019\nequity measures our net\nincome as a percentage\nof adjusted average\ntotal shareholders\u2019\nequity. The tangible\nequity ratio represents\nadjusted ending\nshareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total\ntangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value\nper common share\nrepresents adjusted\nending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by ending common\nshares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios\nutilizing tangible\nequity provide\nadditional useful\ninformation because they\npresent measures of\nthose assets that can\ngenerate income.\nTangible book value per\ncommon share provides\nadditional useful\ninformation about the\nlevel of tangible assets\nin relation to\noutstanding shares of\ncommon stock.\n\nThe aforementioned\nsupplemental data and\nperformance measures are\npresented in Table 5 on\npage 8.\n\nFor more information on\nthe reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the\ncorresponding GAAP\nfinancial measures, see\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\non page 48.\n                                                 \n  Key Performance Indicators                     \n                                                 \nWe present certain key\nfinancial and\nnonfinancial performance\nindicators (key\nperformance indicators)\nthat management uses\nwhen assessing our\nconsolidated and/or\nsegment results.

We take a\ncomprehensive approach\nto risk management with\na defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk\nAppetite Statement,\nwhich are approved\nannually by the\nEnterprise Risk\nCommittee and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework\nserves as the foundation\nfor the consistent and\neffective management of\nrisks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk\nFramework sets forth\nclear roles,\nresponsibilities and\naccountability for the\nmanagement of risk and\nprovides a blueprint for\nhow the Board, through\ndelegation of authority\nto committees and\nexecutive officers,\nestablishes risk\nappetite and associated\nlimits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur Risk Appetite\nStatement is intended to\nensure that the\nCorporation maintains an\nacceptable risk profile\nby providing a common\nframework and a\ncomparable set of\nmeasures for senior\nmanagement and the Board\nto clearly indicate the\nlevel of risk the\nCorporation is willing\nto accept. Risk appetite\nis set at least annually\nand is aligned with the\nCorporation\u2019s strategic,\ncapital and financial\noperating plans. Our\nline-of-business\nstrategies and risk\nappetite are also\nsimilarly aligned.\n\nFor more information\nabout the Corporation \u2019s\nrisks related to the\npandemic, see Item 1A.\nRisk Factors \u2013\nCoronavirus Disease of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. These pandemic-\nrelated risks are being\nmanaged within our Risk\nFramework and supporting\nrisk management\nprograms.\n\nFor more information on\nour Risk Framework, our\nrisk management\nactivities and the key\ntypes of risk faced by\nthe Corporation, see the\nManaging Risk section in\nthe MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                 \n   Capital Management                            \n                                                 \nThe Corporation manages\nits capital position so\nthat its capital is more\nthan adequate to support\nits business activities\nand aligns with risk,\nrisk appetite and\nstrategic planning.

Based on\nthe results of our 2021\nCCAR capital plan and\nrelated supervisory\nstress tests submitted\nin the second quarter of\n2021, we are subject to\na 2.5 percent SCB,\nunchanged from the prior\nlevel, effective October\n1, 2021 to September 30,\n2022. Our CET1 capital\nratio under the\nStandardized approach\nmust remain above 9.5\npercent during this\nperiod in order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments.\n\nDue to uncertainty\nresulting from the\npandemic, the Federal\nReserve imposed various\nrestrictions on share\nrepurchase programs and\ndividends. In\nconjunction with its\nrelease of 2021 CCAR\nsupervisory stress test\nresults, the Federal\nReserve announced those\nrestrictions would end\nas of July 1, 2021 for\nlarge banks, including\nthe Corporation, and\nlarge banks would be\nsubject to the normal\nrestrictions under the\nFederal Reserve's SCB\nframework. Pursuant to\nthe Board\u2019s\nauthorization on April\n15, 2021, during the\nthird quarter of 2021,\nwe repurchased $9.9\nbillion of common stock,\nincluding repurchases to\noffset shares awarded\nunder equity-based\ncompensation plans\nduring the period. On\nOctober 20, 2021, the\nCorporation announced\nthat the Board renewed\nthe Corporation\u2019s $25\nbillion common stock\nrepurchase program\npreviously announced in\nApril 2021. The Board\u2019s\nauthorization replaces\nthe previous program. As\nwith the April\nauthorization, the Board\nalso authorized common\nstock repurchases to\noffset shares awarded\nunder the Corporation\u2019s\nequity-based\ncompensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of\ncommon stock repurchases\nmade pursuant to our\nstock repurchase program\nare subject to various\nfactors, including the\nCorporation\u2019s capital\nposition, liquidity,\nfinancial performance\nand alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading\nprice, regulatory\nrequirements and general\nmarket conditions, and\nmay be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases\nmay be effected through\nopen market purchases or\nprivately negotiated\ntransactions, including\nrepurchase plans that\nsatisfy the conditions\nof Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended\n(Exchange Act).\n                                                 \n  Regulatory Capital                             \n                                                 \nAs a financial services\nholding company, we are\nsubject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including\nBasel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository\ninstitution subsidiaries\nare also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action\n(PCA) framework. The\nCorporation and its\nprimary affiliated\nbanking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel\n3 and are required to\nreport regulatory risk-\nbased capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The\napproach that yields the\nlower ratio is used to\nassess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the PCA\nframework. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, the\nCET1, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital ratios for\nthe Corporation were\nlower under the\nStandardized approach.\n                                                 \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                   \n                                                 \nIn order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments, the\nCorporation must meet\nrisk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that\ninclude a capital\nconservation buffer or\nSCB, plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital\nbuffer and a global\nsystemically important\nbank (G-SIB)\n                                                 \n  Bank of America22                              \n                                                 \nsurcharge. The buffers\nand surcharge must be\ncomprised solely of CET1\ncapital. The\nCorporation's CET1\ncapital ratio must be a\nminimum of 9.5 percent\nunder both the\nStandardized and\nAdvanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is also\nrequired to maintain a\nminimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of\n3.0 percent plus a\nleverage buffer of 2.0\npercent in order to\navoid certain\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments.

ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital rule that allows a five-year\ntransition period related to the adoption of the\ncurrent expected credit losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB\nsurcharge were 2.5 percent at both September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020. At September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, the Corporation's SCB of\n2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital\nconservation buffer under the Standardized\napproach. The countercyclical capital buffer for\nboth periods was zero. The CET1 capital\nregulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital\nratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge\nof 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital\nconservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5\npercent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches\ndiffers from the Standardized approach due to\ndifferences in the amount permitted in Tier 2\ncapital related to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for\ncertain Tier 1 capital deductions.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December\n31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S.\nTreasury securities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after\nMarch 31, 2021 and is not reflected in\nsupplementary leverage exposure at September 30,\n2021.\n                                                 \n  23Bank of America                              \n                                                 \nAt September 30, 2021,\nCET1 capital was $174.4\nbillion, a decrease of\n$2.3 billion from\nDecember 31, 2020,\ndriven by common stock\nrepurchases, dividends\nand lower net unrealized\ngains on available-for-\nsale (AFS) debt\nsecurities included in\naccumulated other\ncomprehensive income\n(OCI), partially offset\nby earnings. Tier 1\ncapital decreased $2.3\nbillion primarily driven\nby the same factors as\nCET1 capital. Total\ncapital under the\nStandardized approach\ndecreased $7.4 billion\nprimarily due to the\nsame factors driving the\ndecrease in CET1\ncapital, and a decrease\nin the adjusted\nallowance for credit\nlosses included in Tier\n2 capital. RWA under the\nStandardized approach,\nwhich yielded the lower\nCET1 capital ratio at\nSeptember 30, 2021,\n\nincreased $88.3 billion\nduring the nine months\nended September 30, 2021\nto $1,568 billion\nprimarily due to strong\nclient activity in\nGlobal Markets and an\nincrease in debt\nsecurities resulting\nfrom the deployment of\ncash received from\ndeposit inflows.\nSupplementary leverage\nexposure at September\n30, 2021 increased\n$729.9 billion during\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\nprimarily due to the\nexpiration of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\ntemporary relief to\nexclude U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks\nand an increase in debt\nsecurities resulting\nfrom the deployment of\ncash received from\ndeposit inflows.\n\nTable 9

The countercyclical buffer is zero\nfor both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage\nexposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5\npercent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer.\nThe TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be\ncomprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1\ncapital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is\ncomprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5\npercent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s\nMethod 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5\npercent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is\nused to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios,\nwhich was the Standardized approach as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December\n31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S.\nTreasury Securities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks.

In\naddition, at September\n30, 2021, $484 million,\nor seven percent, were\nnonperforming. Loans\nthat have yet to enter\nthe amortization period\nin our interest-only\nportfolio are primarily\npost-2008 vintages and\ngenerally have better\ncredit quality than the\nprevious vintages that\nhad entered the\namortization period.

For these same\npositions, we recorded\nnet losses of $18\nmillion and $86 million\nfor the three and nine\nmonths ended September\n30, 2021 compared to net\nlosses of $104 million\nand $106 million for the\nsame periods in 2020.\nThe gains and losses on\nthese instruments were\noffset by gains and\n\nlosses on the related\nexposures. The Value-at-\nRisk (VaR) results for\nthese exposures are\nincluded in the fair\nvalue option portfolio\ninformation in Table 40.\nFor more information,\nsee Trading Risk\nManagement on page 44.\nTables 35 and 36 present\nthe maturity profiles\nand the credit exposure\ndebt ratings of the net\ncredit default\nprotection portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                                 \n            Net                                  \n            Credit                               \n            Default                              \n            Protec\u2026    Septem\u2026       Decemb\u2026     \n  Table     by              30            31     \n  35        Maturi\u2026       2021          2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Less                                           \n  than                                           \n  or                        37  %         65  %  \n  equal                                          \n  to one                                         \n  year                                           \n  Great\u2026                                         \n  than                                           \n  one                                            \n  year                                           \n  and                                            \n  less                      60            34     \n  than                                           \n  or                                             \n  equal                                          \n  to                                             \n  five                                           \n  years                                          \n  Great\u2026                                         \n  than                       3             1     \n  five                                           \n  years                                          \n  Total                                          \n  net                                            \n  credit                   100  %        100  %  \n  defau\u2026                                         \n  prote\u2026                                         \n                                                 \n                                                 \n  Bank of America40                              \n                                                 \n                                                 \n       N\u2026                                        \n       C\u2026                                        \n       D\u2026                                        \n       P\u2026                                        \n  \u2026    by                                        \n  \u2026    C\u2026       N\u2026                 N\u2026            \n  \u2026    E\u2026       S\u2026    Pe\u2026          D\u2026    Pe\u2026     \n  \u2026    D\u2026       3\u2026     of          3\u2026     of     \n  \u2026    R\u2026       2\u2026    To\u2026          2\u2026    To\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026                                              \n  A          $  -\u2026    9.4  %    $  -\u2026    6.0  %  \n  \u2026             -\u2026    38\u2026          -\u2026    44\u2026     \n  \u2026             -\u2026    23\u2026          -\u2026    32\u2026     \n  B             -\u2026    17\u2026          -\u2026    11\u2026     \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026             -\u2026    3.7          -\u2026    4.4     \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026             -\u2026    8.1          -\u2026    1.2     \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026          $  -\u2026    10\u2026  %    $  -\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                              \n  \u2026                                              \n                                                 \n(1) Represents net credit default protection\npurchased.

A risk management\nframework is in place to measure, monitor and\nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition\nto the direct risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect country\nrisks (e.g., related to the collateral received\non secured financing transactions or related to\nclient clearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal course of\nbusiness through credit, market and operational\nrisk governance rather than through country risk\ngovernance.

Table 37 presents our\n20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at\nSeptember 30, 2021. These exposures accounted for\n91 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S.\nexposure at September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries\nincreased $26.1 billion during the nine months\nended September 30, 2021. The majority of the\nincrease was due to higher deposits with central\nbanks in Japan and Ireland, and increased\ncorporate exposure in Canada, Spain and Sweden.\n                                                 \n                                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \nIn light of the global\npandemic and\nconsiderations related\nto the ongoing economic\nrecovery, including\nsupply chain disruptions\nand inflationary\npressures, we continue\nto manage our non-U.S.\nexposure closely in\nimpacted regions while\nsupporting the needs of\nour clients.

During the nine\nmonths ended September\n30, 2021, the decrease\nin asset sensitivity of\nour balance sheet to Up-\nrate and Down-rate\nscenarios was primarily\ndue to ALM activity and\nan increase in long-end\nrates. We continue to be\nasset sensitive to a\nparallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the\nmajority of that impact\ncoming from the short\nend of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher\ninterest rates impact\nthe fair value of debt\nsecurities and,\naccordingly, for debt\nsecurities classified as\nAFS, may adversely\naffect accumulated OCI\nand thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward\nparallel shifts, the\nnear-term adverse impact\nto Basel 3 capital is\nreduced over time by\noffsetting positive\nimpacts to net interest\nincome.

As part of our ALM\nactivities, we use securities, certain\nresidential mortgages, and interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivatives in managing interest\nrate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposits\nportfolio in the baseline forecast and in\nalternate interest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of net\ninterest income. The sensitivity analysis in\nTable 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio\nsize or mix from the baseline forecast in\nalternate rate environments. In higher rate\nscenarios, any customer activity resulting in the\nreplacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing\ndeposits with higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding would reduce our benefit in those\nscenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts We use interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate and\nforeign exchange risks. Specifically, we use\nthose derivatives to manage both the variability\nin cash flows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising from those\nrisks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are\ngenerally non-leveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign exchange\nbasis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and\nour foreign exchange contracts include cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency forward\ncontracts and options. The derivatives used in\nour ALM activities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges and\nother risk management derivatives. Designated\naccounting hedges are primarily used to manage\nour exposure to interest rates as described in\nthe Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking\nBook section and are included in the\nsensitivities presented in Table 43. The\nCorporation also uses foreign currency\nderivatives in accounting hedges to manage\nsubstantially all of the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in this area\nis insignificant. Risk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign exchange\nrisks related to various foreign currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate\nsubstantially all foreign currency exposures in\nthe cash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-trading\nforeign currency-denominated financial\ninstruments. These foreign exchange derivatives\nare sensitive to other market risk exposures such\nas cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate\nrisk. However, as these features are not a\nsignificant component of these foreign exchange\nderivatives, the market risk related to this\nexposure is insignificant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which\nsubject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate\nrisks, among others. We determine whether loans\nwill be held for investment or held for sale at\nthe time of commitment and manage credit and\nliquidity risks by selling or securitizing a\nportion of the loans we originate.\n                                                 \n  Bank of America46                              \n                                                 \nChanges in interest\nrates impact the value\nof interest rate lock\ncommitments (IRLCs) and\nthe related residential\nfirst mortgage loans\nheld-for-sale (LHFS), as\nwell as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the\ninterest rate risks of\nthese hedged items\noffset, we combine them\ninto one overall hedged\nitem with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative\ncontracts and\nsecurities. For more\ninformation on IRLCs and\nthe related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see\nMortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nDuring the three and\nnine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, we\nrecorded gains of $13\nmillion and $35 million\nrelated to the change in\nfair value of the MSRs,\nIRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the\nhedge portfolio,\ncompared to gains of $85\nmillion and $313 million\nfor the same periods in\n2020. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see\nNote 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                 \n   Climate Risk Management                       \n                                                 \nClimate-related risks\nconsist of two major\ncategories: (1) risks\nrelated to the\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon economy, and (2)\nrisks related to the\nphysical impacts of\nclimate change. The\nfinancial effects of\ntransition risk can lead\nto and amplify credit\nrisk. Physical risk can\nalso lead to increased\ncredit risk by\ndiminishing borrowers\u2019\nrepayment capacity or\ncollateral values. As\nclimate risk is\ninterconnected with all\nkey risk types, we have\ndeveloped and continue\nto enhance processes to\nembed climate risk\nconsiderations into our\nRisk Framework and risk\nmanagement programs\nestablished for\nstrategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational\nand reputational risks.\nFor more information on\nour governance framework\nand climate risk\nprocess, see the\nManaging Risk and\nClimate Risk Management\nsections in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. For additional\ninformation on climate\nrisk, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. For information on\nour climate-related\nmetrics that align with\nStakeholder Capitalism\nMetrics published by the\nInternational Business\nCouncil of the World\nEconomic Forum, see our\nAnnual Report 2020 on\nthe Bank of America\nwebsite (the content of\nwhich is not\nincorporated by\nreference into this\nQuarterly Report on Form\n10-Q).\n\nOur Environmental and\nSocial Risk Policy\n(ESRP) Framework aligns\nwith our Risk Framework\nand provides additional\nclarity and transparency\nregarding our approach\nto environmental and\nsocial risks, inclusive\nof climate risk.\nEffective management of\n\nclimate risk requires\ncoordinated governance,\nclearly defined roles\nand responsibilities,\nand well-developed\nprocesses to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and\ncontrol that risk\nappropriately and in a\ntimely manner, all of\nwhich remain key areas\nof focus, as we continue\nto build out and enhance\nour capabilities in this\narea.\n\nAs outlined in our ESRP\nFramework, we are\nfocused on supporting\nand financing areas\ncritical to the\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon society.\nAccordingly, we have a\ngoal, publicly announced\nin early 2021, to\nachieve net-zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nin our financing\nactivities, operations\nand supply chain before\n2050. More broadly,\nachieving this goal will\nrequire technological\nadvances, clearly\ndefined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, public\npolicies, including\nthose that improve cost\nof capital for net-zero\ntransition and better\nemissions data\nreporting, as well as\nongoing, strong and\nactive engagement with\nclients, suppliers,\ninvestors, government\nofficials and other\nstakeholders. In 2021,\nwe also announced a goal\nto deploy and mobilize\n$1 trillion by 2030 to\naccelerate the\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon, sustainable\neconomy by providing\nlending, capital\nraising, advisory and\ninvestment services, and\nby developing other\nclient driven financial\nsolutions. This latter\ncommitment anchors a\nbroader $1.5 trillion\nsustainable finance goal\nto support both\nenvironmental transition\nand social inclusive\ndevelopment, which spans\nbusiness activities\nacross the globe. These\ngoals are intended to\nhelp drive business\nopportunities and\nenhance risk management\nrelated to the\ntransition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Given\nthe extended period of\nthese goals, our\ninitiatives have not\nresulted in a\nsignificant effect on\nour results of\noperations or financial\ncondition in the\nrelevant periods\npresented herein, and\nare not expected to have\na significant effect in\nthe near term.\n\nThe foregoing discussion\nregarding our goals and\ncommitments with respect\nto climate risk\nmanagement, including\nenvironmental transition\nconsiderations, includes\n\u201cforward-looking\nstatements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are not\nguarantees of future\nresults or performance\nand involve certain\nknown and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and\nassumptions that are\ndifficult to predict and\nare often beyond the\nCorporation\u2019s control.\nActual outcomes and\nresults may differ\nmaterially from those\nexpressed in, or implied\nby, any of these\nforward-looking\nstatements.\n                                                 \n  Complex Accounting Estimates                   \n                                                 \nOur significant\naccounting principles\nare essential in\nunderstanding the MD&A.\nMany of our significant\naccounting principles\nrequire complex\njudgments to estimate\nthe values of assets and\nliabilities.

bank\nholding company and a\nfinancial holding\ncompany, provides a\ndiverse range of\nfinancial services and\nproducts throughout the\nU.S. and in certain\ninternational markets.\nThe term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used\nherein may refer to Bank\nof America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of\nAmerica Corporation and\nits subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of\nAmerica Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or\naffiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\ninclude the accounts of\nthe Corporation and its\nmajority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those\nvariable interest\nentities (VIEs) where\nthe Corporation is the\nprimary beneficiary.\nIntercompany accounts\nand transactions have\nbeen eliminated. Results\nof operations of\nacquired companies are\nincluded from the dates\nof acquisition, and for\nVIEs, from the dates\nthat the Corporation\nbecame the primary\nbeneficiary. Assets held\nin an agency or\nfiduciary capacity are\nnot included in the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. The\nCorporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies\nfor which it owns a\nvoting interest and for\nwhich it has the ability\nto exercise significant\ninfluence over operating\nand financing decisions\nusing the equity method\nof accounting. These\ninvestments are included\nin other assets. Equity\nmethod investments are\nsubject to impairment\ntesting, and the\nCorporation\u2019s\nproportionate share of\nincome or loss is\nincluded in other\nincome. The preparation\nof the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in\nconformity with\naccounting principles\ngenerally accepted in\nthe United States of\nAmerica requires\nmanagement to make\nestimates and\nassumptions that affect\nreported amounts and\ndisclosures. Actual\nresults could materially\ndiffer from those\nestimates and\nassumptions.\n\nThese unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements should be\nread in conjunction with\nthe audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements,\nand related notes\nthereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business\nis such that the results\nof any interim period\nare not necessarily\nindicative of results\nfor a full year. In the\nopinion of management,\nall adjustments, which\nconsist of normal\nrecurring adjustments\nnecessary for a fair\nstatement of the interim\nperiod results, have\nbeen made. The\nCorporation evaluates\nsubsequent events\nthrough the date of\nfiling with the\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission. Certain\nprior-period amounts\nhave been reclassified\nto conform to current-\nperiod presentation.\nU.K. Tax Law Changes In\nJune 2021, the U.K.\nenacted the 2021 Finance\nAct, which increases the\nU.K. corporation income\ntax rate to 25 percent\nfrom 19 percent,\neffective April 1, 2023.\nIn addition, in July\n2020, the U.K. enacted a\nreversal of the final\ntwo percent of scheduled\ndecreases in the U.K.\ncorporation income tax\nrate.As a result, during\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation\nrecorded a write-up of\nU.K. net deferred tax\nassets of approximately\n$ 2.0billion and $\n700million with\ncorresponding positive\nincome tax adjustments.\n\nNOTE 2 Net Interest\nIncome and Noninterest\nIncome\nThe following table\npresents the\nCorporation\u2019s net\ninterest income and\nnoninterest income\ndisaggregated by revenue\nsource for the three and\nnine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\n2020.

The Corporation also uses these types of\ncontracts to protect against changes in the cash\nflows of its assets and liabilities, and other\nforecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The\nCorporation hedges its net investment in\nconsolidated non-U.S. operations determined to\nhave functional currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar using forward exchange contracts and\ncross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing\nforeign currency-denominated debt (net investment\nhedges).

In\nconnection with these transfers, the Corporation\nreceived gross cash proceeds of $ 4.9billion and\n$ 5.2billion at the transfer dates. At September\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of\nthe transferred securities was $ 5.1billion and $\n5.5billion.

It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to\ninclude these derivative instruments in its\ntrading activities, which include derivatives and\nnon-derivative cash instruments. The resulting\nrisk from these derivatives is managed on a\nportfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s\nGlobal Markets business segment.

credit\nderivatives based solely\non the notional amount\nbecause this measure\ndoes not take into\nconsideration the\nprobability of\noccurrence. As such, the\nnotional amount is not a\nreliable indicator of\nthe Corporation\u2019s\nexposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a\nrisk framework is used\nto define risk\ntolerances and establish\nlimits so that certain\ncredit risk-related\nlosses occur within\nacceptable, predefined\nlimits. Credit-related\nnotes in the table above\ninclude investments in\nsecurities issued by\ncollateralized debt\nobligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan\nobligation (CLO) and\ncredit-linked note\nvehicles. These\ninstruments are\nprimarily classified as\ntrading securities. The\ncarrying value of these\ninstruments equals the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not\nobligated to make any\npayments to the entities\nunder the terms of the\nsecurities owned.\nCredit-related\nContingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of\nthe Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts\ncontain credit risk-\nrelated contingent\nfeatures, primarily in\nthe form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and\ncredit support\ndocumentation that\nenhance the\ncreditworthiness of\nthese instruments\ncompared to other\nobligations of the\nrespective counterparty\nwith whom the\nCorporation has\ntransacted. These\ncontingent features may\nbe for the benefit of\nthe Corporation as well\nas its counterparties\nwith respect to changes\nin the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the\nmark-to-market exposure\nunder the derivative\ntransactions. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nCorporation held cash\nand securities\ncollateral of $\n87.2billion and $\n96.5billion and posted\ncash and securities\ncollateral of $\n73.7billion and $\n88.6billion in the\nnormal course of\nbusiness under\nderivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product\nmargining agreements\nwhere clients are\npermitted to margin on a\nnet basis for both\nderivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements.\nIn connection with\ncertain over-the-counter\nderivative contracts and\nother trading\nagreements, the\nCorporation can be\nrequired to provide\nadditional collateral or\nto terminate\ntransactions with\ncertain counterparties\nin the event of a\ndowngrade of the senior\ndebt ratings of the\nCorporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount\nof additional collateral\nrequired depends on the\ncontract and is usually\na fixed incremental\namount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure.\nFor more information on\ncredit-related\ncontingent features and\ncollateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. At September 30,\n2021, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated\nbased on the terms of\nthe contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be\nrequired to post to\ncounterparties but had\nnot yet posted to\ncounterparties was $\n2.4billion, including $\n1.1billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National\nAssociation. Some\ncounterparties are\ncurrently able to\nunilaterally terminate\ncertain contracts, or\nthe Corporation or\ncertain\n\nsubsidiaries may be\nrequired to take other\naction such as find a\nsuitable replacement or\nobtain a guarantee. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nliability recorded for\nthese derivative\ncontracts was not\nsignificant.\nThe table below presents the amount of additional\ncollateral that would have been contractually\nrequired by derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements at September 30, 2021 if the\nrating agencies had downgraded their long-term\nsenior debt ratings for the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and\nby an additional second incremental notch.

For more information\non the portfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWithin the Consumer Real Estate portfolio\nsegment, the primary credit quality indicators\nare refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed\nFair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed\nLTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a\npercentage of the value of the property securing\nthe loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans\nare evaluated using combined loan-to-value\n(CLTV), which measures the carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens\nagainst the property as a percentage of the value\nof the property securing the loan, refreshed\nquarterly. FICO score measures the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower based on the\nfinancial obligations of the borrower and the\nborrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are\ntypically refreshed quarterly or more frequently.\nCertain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had\ndebts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may\nnot have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores\nare also a primary credit quality indicator for\nthe Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio\nsegment and the business card portfolio within\nU.S. small business commercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated\nusing the internal classifications of pass rated\nor reservable criticized as the primary credit\nquality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that\nare internally classified or listed by the\nCorporation as Special Mention, Substandard or\nDoubtful, which are asset quality categories\ndefined by regulatory authorities. These assets\nhave an elevated level of risk and may have a\nhigh probability of default or total loss. Pass\nrated refers to all loans not considered\nreservable criticized. In addition to these\nprimary credit quality indicators, the\nCorporation uses other credit quality indicators\nfor certain types of loans. The following tables\npresent certain credit quality indicators for the\nCorporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card\nand Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by class of financing receivables and\nyear of origination for term loan balances at\nSeptember 30, 2021, including revolving loans\nthat converted to term loans without an\nadditional credit decision after origination

Commercial\nreservable criticized\nutilized exposure\ndecreased to $\n24.1billion at September\n30, 2021 from $\n38.7billion (to\n4.53percent from\n7.31percent of total\ncommercial reservable\nutilized exposure) at\nDecember 31, 2020, which\nwas broad-based across\nindustries.\nTroubled Debt\nRestructurings The\nCorporation has been\nentering into loan\nmodifications with\nborrowers in response to\nthe pandemic, most of\nwhich are not classified\nas TDRs and therefore\nare not included in the\nfollowing discussion.\nFor more information on\nthe criteria for\nclassifying loans as\nTDRs, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. Consumer Real\nEstate Modifications of\nconsumer real estate\nloans are classified as\nTDRs when the borrower\nis experiencing\nfinancial difficulties\nand a concession has\nbeen granted.\nConcessions may include\nreductions in interest\nrates, capitalization of\npast due amounts,\nprincipal and/or\ninterest forbearance,\npayment extensions,\nprincipal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or\ncombinations thereof.\nPrior to permanently\nmodifying a loan, the\nCorporation may enter\ninto trial modifications\nwith certain borrowers\nunder both government\nand proprietary\nprograms. Trial\nmodifications generally\nrepresent a three- to\nfour-month period during\nwhich the borrower makes\nmonthly payments under\nthe anticipated modified\npayment terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of\nthe trial period, the\nCorporation and the\nborrower enter into a\npermanent modification.\nBinding trial\nmodifications are\nclassified as TDRs when\nthe trial offer is made\nand continue to be\nclassified as TDRs\nregardless of whether\nthe borrower enters into\na permanent\nmodification. Consumer\nreal estate loans of $\n323million that have\nbeen discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy\nwith no change in\nrepayment terms and not\nreaffirmed by the\nborrower were included\nin TDRs at September 30,\n2021, of which $\n95million were\nclassified as\nnonperforming and $\n57million were loans\nfully insured. Consumer\nreal estate TDRs are\nmeasured primarily based\non the net present value\nof the estimated cash\nflows discounted at\n\nthe loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate.\nIf the carrying value of\na TDR exceeds this\namount, a specific\nallowance is recorded as\na component of the\nallowance for loan and\nlease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer\nreal estate TDRs that\nare considered to be\ndependent solely on the\ncollateral for repayment\n(e.g., due to the lack\nof income verification)\nare measured based on\nthe estimated fair value\nof the collateral, and a\ncharge-off is recorded\nif the carrying value\nexceeds the fair value\nof the collateral.\nConsumer real estate\nloans that reach 180\ndays past due prior to\nmodification are charged\noff to their net\nrealizable value, less\ncosts to sell, before\nthey are modified as\nTDRs in accordance with\nestablished policy.\nSubsequent declines in\nthe fair value of the\ncollateral after a loan\nhas reached 180 days\npast due are recorded as\ncharge-offs. Fully-\ninsured loans are\nprotected against\nprincipal loss, and\ntherefore, the\nCorporation does not\nrecord an allowance for\nloan and lease losses on\nthe outstanding\nprincipal balance, even\nafter they have been\nmodified in a TDR. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nremaining commitments to\nlend additional funds to\ndebtors whose terms have\nbeen modified in a\nconsumer real estate TDR\nwere not significant.\nConsumer real estate\nforeclosed properties\ntotaled $ 87million and\n$ 123million at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. The\ncarrying value of\nconsumer real estate\nloans, including fully-\ninsured loans, for which\nformal foreclosure\nproceedings were in\nprocess at September 30,\n2021 was $ 1.1billion.\nDuring the nine months\nended September 30,\n2021, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 33million\nof consumer real estate\nloans, to foreclosed\nproperties or, for\nproperties acquired upon\nforeclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed\nloans (principally FHA-\ninsured loans), to other\nassets. The\nreclassifications\nrepresent non-cash\ninvesting activities\nand, accordingly, are\nnot reflected in the\nConsolidated Statement\nof Cash Flows. The table\nbelow presents the\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\n2020 unpaid principal\nbalance, carrying value,\nand average pre- and\npost-modification\ninterest rates of\nconsumer real estate\nloans that were modified\nin TDRs during the three\nand nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\n2020.

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve reducing the\ninterest rate on the account, placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60\nmonths and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit, all of which are considered TDRs.\nThe Corporation makes loan modifications directly\nwith borrowers for debt held only by the\nCorporation (internal programs).

Payment\ndefaults are one of the\nfactors considered when\nprojecting future cash\nflows in the calculation\nof the allowance for\nloan and lease losses\nfor credit card and\nother consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience,\nthe Corporation\nestimates that 10percent\nof new credit card TDRs\nand 16percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer\nTDRs may be in payment\ndefault within 12months\nafter modification.\nCommercial Loans\nModifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers\nthat are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the\nCorporation\u2019s loss\nexposure while providing\nthe borrower with an\nopportunity to work\nthrough financial\ndifficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or\nbankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique\nand reflects the\nindividual circumstances\nof the borrower.\nModifications that\nresult in a TDR may\ninclude extensions of\nmaturity at a\nconcessionary (below\nmarket) rate of\ninterest, payment\nforbearances or other\nactions designed to\nbenefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the\nCorporation\u2019s risk\nexposure. Reductions in\ninterest rates are rare.\nInstead, the interest\nrates are typically\nincreased, although the\nincreased rate may not\nrepresent a market rate\nof interest.\nInfrequently,\nconcessions may also\ninclude principal\nforgiveness in\nconnection with\nforeclosure, short sale\nor other settlement\nagreements leading to\ntermination or sale of\nthe loan. At the time of\nrestructuring, the loans\nare remeasured to\nreflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash\nflows resulting from the\nmodified terms. If a\nportion of the loan is\ndeemed to be\nuncollectible, a charge-\noff may be recorded at\nthe time of\nrestructuring.\nAlternatively, a charge-\noff may have already\nbeen recorded in a\nprevious period such\nthat no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of\nmodification. During the\nthree and nine months\nended September 30,\n2021, the carrying value\nof the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that\nwere modified as TDRs\nwas $ 213million and $\n1.1billion compared to $\n588million and $\n1.5billion for the same\nperiods in 2020. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nCorporation had\ncommitments to lend $\n272million and $\n402million to commercial\nborrowers whose loans\nare classified as\n\nTDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in\npayment default was $\n168million and $\n218million at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. Loans Held-\nfor-sale The Corporation\nhad LHFS of $ 9.4billion\nand $ 9.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. Cash\nand non-cash proceeds\nfrom sales and paydowns\nof loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were\n$ 27.0billion and $\n16.1billion for the nine\nmonths ended September\n30, 2021 and 2020. Cash\nused for originations\nand purchases of LHFS\ntotaled approximately $\n27.0billion and $\n11.1billion for the nine\nmonths ended September\n30, 2021 and 2020.\nAccrued Interest\nReceivable Accrued\ninterest receivable for\nloans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 was $\n2.2billion and $\n2.4billion and is\nreported in customer and\nother receivables on the\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding\ncredit card loan\nbalances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and\nfees. Credit card loans\nare not classified as\nnonperforming but are\ncharged off no later\nthan the end of the\nmonth in which the\naccount becomes 180 days\npast due, within 60 days\nafter receipt of\nnotification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon\nconfirmation of fraud .\nDuring the three and\nnine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, the\nCorporation reversed $\n87million and $\n369million of interest\nand fee income against\nthe income statement\nline item in which it\nwas originally recorded\nupon charge-off of the\nprincipal balance of the\nloan . For the\noutstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity,\ndirect/indirect consumer\nand commercial loan\nbalances classified as\nnonperforming during the\nthree and nine months\nended September 30,\n2021, interest and fee\nincome reversed at the\ntime the loans were\nclassified as\nnonperforming was not\nsignificant.

These scenarios include key\nmacroeconomic variables such as gross domestic\nproduct, unemployment rate, real estate prices\nand corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that\nare chosen each quarter and the weighting given\nto each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading\neconomic indicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends. For more\ninformation on the Corporation's credit loss\naccounting policies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe September 30, 2021 estimate for allowance for\ncredit losses was based on various economic\noutlooks that included consensus estimates, a\ndownside scenario that assumed a significantly\nlonger period until economic recovery, a tail\nrisk scenario similar to the severely adverse\nscenario used in stress testing, a scenario to\naccount for inflationary risk and higher interest\nrates and an upside scenario to consider the\npotential for improvement in the consensus\noutlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes\nthat the U.S. unemployment rate will be just\nabove fivepercent by the fourth quarters of 2022\nand 2023, which includes the impacts of the\ndownside scenarios noted above. Additionally, in\nthis economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic\nproduct is forecasted to grow at 1.8percent and\n1.9percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters\nof 2022 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses\nconsidered the impact of enacted government\nstimulus measures and continued to factor in the\nuncertainty resulting from the unprecedented\nnature of the current health crisis and risks\nthat may prevent a full economic recovery. While\nthere has been improvement across the economy,\nthe Corporation continues to factor into its\nallowance for credit losses an estimated impact\nfrom higher-risk segments that included leveraged\nloans and industries such as travel and\nentertainment, which have been adversely impacted\nby the effects of the pandemic. The allowance for\ncredit losses at September 30, 2021 was $\n14.7billion, a decrease of $ 6.0billion compared\nto December 31, 2020. The decrease in the\nallowance for credit losses was primarily driven\nby improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and\ncredit quality. The change in the allowance for\ncredit losses was comprised of a net decrease of\n$ 5.6billion in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and a $ 340million decrease in the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in\nthe allowance for credit losses was attributed to\n$ 342million in the consumer real estate\nportfolio, $ 2.6billion in the credit card and\nother consumer portfolio, and $ 3.1billion in the\ncommercial portfolio. Similarly, the provision\nfor credit losses improved $ 2.0billion to a\nbenefit of $ 624million and $ 15.4billion to a\nbenefit of $ 4.1billion for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 compared to the\nsame periods in 2020. The benefit in the three-\nmonth period was primarily due to credit quality\nimprovements. The benefit in the nine-month\nperiod was primarily driven by improvements in\nthe macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans\naccounted for under the fair value option\ndecreased $ 1.0billion in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 driven by consumer loans,\nwhich decreased $ 5.2billion primarily due to a\ndecline in consumer real estate due to\nprepayments in a low rate environment. However,\noutstanding commercial loans and leases,\nexcluding small business, increased $ 17.9billion\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2021,\nprimarily driven by Global Markets. The changes\nin the allowance for credit losses, including net\ncharge-offs and provision for loan and lease\nlosses, are detailed in the following table.\n

The\ntables also present the\nCorporation's maximum\nloss exposure at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020\nresulting from its\ninvolvement with\nconsolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Corporation\nholds a variable\ninterest. For more\ninformation on the\nCorporation's use of\nVIEs and related maximum\nloss exposure, see Note\n1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples and Note 6 \u2013\nSecuritizations and\nOther Variable Interest\nEntities to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K.

These\nsecurities and loans are\nincluded in Note 4 \u2013\nSecurities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and\nLeases and Allowance for\nCredit\n                                                 \n  Bank of America76                              \n                                                 \nLosses. In addition, the Corporation has used\nVIEs in connection with its funding activities.\nThe Corporation did not provide financial support\nto consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021 or the year\nended December 31, 2020 that it was not\npreviously contractually required to provide, nor\ndoes it intend to do so. The Corporation had\nliquidity commitments, including written put\noptions and collateral value guarantees, with\ncertain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 968million and $\n929million at September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part\nof its mortgage banking activities, the\nCorporation securitizes a portion of the first-\nlien residential mortgage loans it originates or\npurchases from third parties. Except as described\nin Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the\nCorporation does not provide guarantees or\nrecourse to the securitization trusts other than\nstandard representations and warranties. The\ntable below summarizes select information related\nto first-lien mortgage securitizations for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2021\nand 2020.\n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                                                 \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential\nmortgage loans to securitizations sponsored\nprimarily by the Government-sponsored enterprise\n(GSEs) or Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (GNMA) in the normal course of\nbusiness and primarily receives RMBS in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are\nclassified as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy and are typically sold shortly after\nreceipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential\nmortgage loans securitized are initially\nclassified as LHFS and accounted for under the\nfair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS\nprior to securitization, which totaled $\n24million and $ 97million, net of hedges, during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30,\n2021 compared to $ 44million and $ 105million for\nthe same periods in 2020, are not included in the\ntable above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to\nrepurchase delinquent loans out of securitization\ntrusts, which reduces the amount of servicing\nadvances it is required to make.

Repurchased\nloans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the\nsale or securitization of consumer real estate\nloans. The unpaid principal balance of loans\nserviced for investors, including residential\nmortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n129.6billion and $ 172.5billion at September 30,\n2021 and 2020.

For both\nconsolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan\nVIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the\nreserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more\ninformation, see Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies .\n(2) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nloans and leases in the consolidated credit card\ntrust included $ 4.0billion and $ 7.6billion of\nseller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued\nusing quoted market prices or observable market\ninputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains\ninterests, primarily senior securities, in home\nequity securitization trusts to which it\ntransferred home equity loans. In addition, the\nCorporation may be obligated to provide\nsubordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid\namortization event. This obligation is included\nin the maximum loss exposure in the table above.\nThe charges that will ultimately be recorded as a\nresult of the rapid amortization events depend on\nthe undrawn portion of the home equity lines of\ncredit, performance of the loans, the amount of\nsubsequent draws and the timing of related cash\nflows.\n                                                 \n  Bank of America78                              \n                                                 \nCredit Card Securitizations The Corporation\nsecuritizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement\nwith the securitization trust includes servicing\nthe receivables, retaining an undivided interest\n(seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and\nholding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and\nfees on the securitized receivables and cash\nreserve accounts. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, there were $ 1.0billion of\nnew senior debt securities issued to third-party\ninvestors from the credit card securitization\ntrust. No new senior debt securities were issued\nto third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Corporation held\nsubordinate securities issued by the credit card\nsecuritization trust with a notional principal\namount of $ 6.5billion and $ 6.8billion. These\nsecurities serve as a form of credit enhancement\nto the senior debt securities and have a stated\ninterest rate of zeropercent. There were $\n161million of these subordinate securities issued\nby the credit card securitization trust during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2021. No\nsubordinate securities were issued by the credit\ncard securitization trust during the nine months\nended September 30, 2020. Resecuritization Trusts\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically\nMBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the\nrequest of customers seeking securities with\nspecific characteristics. Generally, there are no\nsignificant ongoing activities performed in a\nresecuritization trust, and no single investor\nhas the unilateral ability to liquidate the\ntrust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 5.9billion\nand $ 20.6billion of securities during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared\nto $ 8.3billion and $ 26.4billion for the same\nperiods in 2020. Securities transferred into\nresecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recorded in market\nmaking and similar activities prior to the\nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or\nloss on sale was recorded. During the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities\nwith an initial fair value of $ 1.0billion and $\n1.6billion compared to $ 598million and $\n5.5billion, of which substantially all of the\nsecurities in the current-year period were\nclassified as trading account assets. All of the\nsecurities received as resecuritization proceeds\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2020\nwere classified as trading account assets. Of the\nsecurities received as resecuritization proceeds\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2020,\n$ 1.8billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were\nclassified as trading account assets, debt\nsecurities carried at fair value and HTM\nsecurities, respectively. Substantially all of\nthe trading account securities carried at fair\nvalue were categorized as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The\nCorporation administers municipal bond trusts\nthat hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate\nmunicipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by\nissuing floating-rate trust certificates that\nreprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to\nthird-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s\nliquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal\nbond trusts, including those for which the\nCorporation was transferor, totaled $ 3.9billion\nand $ 3.5billion at September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. The weighted-average remaining\nlife of bonds held in the trusts at September 30,\n2021 was 6.4years. There were no significant\nwrite-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2021\nand 2020.

The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 2.8billion\nand $ 2.3billion at September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, including the notional amount\nof derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty, net of losses previously recorded,\nand the Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs.\n                                                 \n  79Bank of America                              \n                                                 \nCollateralized Debt\nObligation VIEs The\nCorporation receives\nfees for structuring CDO\nVIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of\nfixed-income securities,\ntypically corporate debt\nor ABS, which the CDO\nVIEs fund by issuing\nmultiple tranches of\ndebt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are\ngenerally managed by\nthird-party portfolio\nmanagers.

These\ncommitments expose the\nCorporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and\nmarket risk and are\nsubject to the same\ncredit and market risk\nlimitation reviews as\nthose instruments\nrecorded on the\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet. For more\ninformation on\ncommitments and\ncontingencies, see Note\n12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K. Credit Extension\nCommitments The\nCorporation enters into\ncommitments to extend\ncredit such as loan\ncommitments, standby\nletters of credit\n(SBLCs) and commercial\nletters of credit to\nmeet the financing needs\nof its customers. The\nfollowing table includes\nthe notional amount of\nunfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net\nof amounts\n\ndistributed (i.e.,\nsyndicated or\nparticipated) to other\nfinancial institutions.\nThe distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.3billion and $\n10.5billion at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. The carrying\nvalue of these\ncommitments at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, excluding\ncommitments accounted\nfor under the fair value\noption, was $ 1.5billion\nand $ 1.9billion, which\npredominantly related to\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these\ncommitments is\nclassified in accrued\nexpenses and other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet. Legally binding\ncommitments to extend\ncredit generally have\nspecified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of\nthese commitments have\nadverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the\nCorporation against\ndeterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to\npay. The following table\nincludes the notional\namount of commitments of\n$ 4.9billion and $\n4.0billion at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020 that are\naccounted for under the\nfair value option.\nHowever, the table\nexcludes the cumulative\nnet fair value for these\ncommitments of $\n95million and $\n99million at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, which is\nclassified in accrued\nexpenses and other\nliabilities.

Amounts in the\ntable include consumer SBLCs of $ 495million and\n$ 500million at September 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020.\n\n(3) Includes business card unused lines of\ncredit.\nOther Commitments At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential\nmortgage and commercial real estate) of $\n102million and $ 93million, which upon settlement\nwill be included in trading account assets, loans\nor LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 484million and $ 645million, which\nupon settlement will be included in trading\naccount assets. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase commodities, primarily\nliquefied natural gas, of $ 1.1billion and $\n582million, which upon settlement will be\nincluded in trading account assets. At September\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation\nhad commitments to enter into resale and forward-\ndated resale and securities borrowing agreements\nof $ 129.9billion and $ 66.5billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements of $\n68.9billion and $ 32.1billion. These commitments\ngenerally expire within the next 12 months. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCorporation had a commitment to originate or\npurchase up to $ 4.0billion and $ 3.9billion on a\nrolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases\nfrom a strategic partner. This commitment extends\nthrough November 2022 and can be terminated with\n12months prior notice. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Corporation had unfunded\nequity investment commitments of $ 392million and\n$ 213million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life\nInsurance Book Value Protection The Corporation\nsells products that offer book value protection\nto insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily\nbanks. At September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, the notional amount of these guarantees\ntotaled $ 6.3billion and $ 7.1billion. At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these\nguarantees totaled $ 927million and $ 1.1billion,\nwith estimated maturity dates between 2033 and\n2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its\nrole as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of\nother merchant acquirers may be held liable for\nany reversed charges that cannot be collected\nfrom the merchants, due to, among other things,\nmerchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are\nproperly reversed after a purchase and cannot be\ncollected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for\nthese reversed charges. The ability to reverse a\ncharge is primarily governed by the applicable\nregulatory and card network rules, which include,\nbut are not limited to, the type of charge, type\nof payment used and time limits. The total amount\nof transactions processed for the preceding six-\nmonth period, which was $ 450.7billion, is an\nestimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure as of September 30, 2021. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates\nto circumstances where a cardholder has purchased\ngoods or services for future delivery. The\nCorporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash\ndeposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other\ntypes of collateral from certain merchants. The\nCorporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and\nthe losses incurred related to the merchant\nprocessing activity were not significant. The\nCorporation continues to monitor its exposure in\nthis area due to the potential economic impacts\nof the pandemic. Representations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees For more\ninformation on representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12\n\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K .\n                                                 \n  Bank of America84                              \n                                                 \nThe reserve for\nrepresentations and\nwarranties obligations\nand corporate guarantees\nwas $ 1.2billion and $\n1.3billion at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020 and is included\nin accrued expenses and\nother liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance\nSheet, and the related\nprovision is included in\nother income in the\nConsolidated Statement\nof Income. The\nrepresentations and\nwarranties reserve\nrepresents the\nCorporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable\nincurred losses, is\nbased on its experience\nin previous\nnegotiations, and is\nsubject to judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions,\nand known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and\nwarranties losses may\noccur in excess of the\namounts recorded for\nthese exposures;\nhowever, the Corporation\ndoes not expect such\namounts to be material\nto the Corporation's\nfinancial condition and\nliquidity. See\nLitigation and\nRegulatory Matters below\nfor the Corporation's\ncombined range of\npossible loss in excess\nof the reserve for\nrepresentations and\nwarranties and the\naccrued liability for\nlitigation. Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\nSponsored Member Repo\nProgram The Corporation\nacts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation\nclears certain eligible\nresale and repurchase\nagreements through the\nGovernment Securities\nDivision of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing\nCorporation on behalf of\nclients that are\nsponsored members in\naccordance with the\nFixed Income Clearing\nCorporation\u2019s rules. As\npart of this program,\nthe Corporation\nguarantees the payment\nand performance of its\nsponsored members to the\nFixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. The\nCorporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by\na security interest in\ncash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral\nplaced by clients with\nthe clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential\nfor the Corporation to\nincur significant losses\nunder this arrangement\nis remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum\npotential exposure,\nwithout taking into\nconsideration the\nrelated collateral, was\n$ 34.7billion and $\n22.5billion at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. Other\nGuarantees The\nCorporation has entered\ninto additional\nguarantee agreements and\ncommitments, including\nsold risk participation\nswaps, liquidity\nfacilities, lease-end\nobligation agreements,\npartial credit\nguarantees on certain\nleases, real estate\njoint venture\nguarantees, divested\nbusiness commitments and\nsold put options that\nrequire gross\nsettlement. The maximum\npotential future\npayments under these\nagreements are\napproximately $\n10.5billion and $\n8.8billion at September\n30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. The estimated\nmaturity dates of these\nobligations extend up to\n2049. The Corporation\nhas made no material\npayments under these\nguarantees. For more\ninformation on maximum\npotential future\npayments under VIE-\nrelated liquidity\ncommitments, see Note 6\n\u2013 Securitizations and\nOther Variable Interest\nEntities . In the normal\ncourse of business, the\nCorporation periodically\nguarantees the\nobligations of its\naffiliates in a variety\nof transactions\nincluding ISDA-related\ntransactions and non-\nISDA related\ntransactions such as\ncommodities trading,\nrepurchase\n\nagreements, prime\nbrokerage agreements and\nother transactions.\nGuarantees of Certain\nLong-term Debt The\nCorporation, as the\nparent company, fully\nand unconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nBofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance\nsubsidiary of the\nCorporation, and\neffectively provides for\nthe full and\nunconditional guarantee\nof trust securities\nissued by certain\nstatutory trust\ncompanies that are\n100percent owned finance\nsubsidiaries of the\nCorporation.\n\nLitigation and\nRegulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures\nsupplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior\ncommitments and\ncontingencies\ndisclosure). In the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, the\nCorporation and its\nsubsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in\nor parties to many\npending and threatened\nlegal, regulatory and\ngovernmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of\nthe inherent difficulty\nof predicting the\noutcome of such matters,\nparticularly where the\nclaimants seek very\nlarge or indeterminate\ndamages or where the\nmatters present novel\nlegal theories or\ninvolve a large number\nof parties, the\nCorporation generally\ncannot predict the\neventual outcome of the\npending matters, timing\nof the ultimate\nresolution of these\nmatters, or eventual\nloss, fines or penalties\nrelated to each pending\nmatter. As a matter\ndevelops, the\nCorporation, in\nconjunction with any\noutside counsel handling\nthe matter, evaluates\nwhether such matter\npresents a loss\ncontingency that is\nprobable and estimable,\nand, for the matters\ndescribed below and the\nmatters disclosed in the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies\ndisclosure, whether a\nloss in excess of any\naccrued liability is\nreasonably possible in\nfuture periods. Once the\nloss contingency is\ndeemed to be both\nprobable and estimable,\nthe Corporation will\nestablish an accrued\nliability and record a\ncorresponding amount of\nlitigation-related\nexpense. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the\nmatter for further\ndevelopments that could\naffect the amount of the\naccrued liability that\nhas been previously\nestablished. Excluding\nexpenses of internal and\nexternal legal service\nproviders, litigation-\nrelated expense of $\n66million and $\n155million was\nrecognized for the three\nand nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\ncompared to $ 636million\nand $ 717million for the\nsame periods in 2020.\nFor any matter disclosed\nin this Note and in the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies\ndisclosure, for which a\nloss in future periods\nis reasonably possible\nand estimable (whether\nin excess of an accrued\nliability or where there\nis no accrued liability)\nand for representations\nand warranties\nexposures, the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss\nis $ 0to $ 1.1billion in\nexcess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021. The\naccrued liability and\nestimated range of\npossible loss are based\nupon currently available\ninformation and subject\nto significant judgment,\na variety of assumptions\nand known and\n                                                 \n  85Bank of America                              \n                                                 \nunknown uncertainties.\nThe matters underlying\nthe accrued liability\nand estimated range of\npossible loss are\nunpredictable and may\nchange from time to\ntime, and actual losses\nmay vary significantly\nfrom the current\nestimate and accrual.\nThe estimated range of\npossible loss does not\nrepresent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure.\nInformation is provided\nbelow, or in the prior\ncommitments and\ncontingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of\nthe litigation and,\nwhere specified,\nassociated claimed\ndamages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and\ntaking into account\naccrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not\nbelieve that loss\ncontingencies arising\nfrom pending matters,\nincluding the matters\ndescribed below, and in\nthe prior commitments\nand contingencies\ndisclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non the consolidated\nfinancial condition or\nliquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in\nlight of the significant\njudgment, variety of\nassumptions and\nuncertainties involved\nin those matters, some\nof which are beyond the\nCorporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or\nindeterminate damages\nsought in some of those\nmatters, an adverse\noutcome in one or more\nof these matters could\nbe material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business\nor results of operations\nfor any particular\nreporting period, or\ncause significant\nreputational harm. Ambac\nBond Insurance\nLitigation Ambac v.\nCountrywide I On May 11,\n2021, the First\nDepartment, a New York\nState appellate court,\naffirmed the dismissal\nof Ambac\u2019s fraudulent\ninducement claim. LIBOR,\nOther Reference Rates,\nForeign Exchange and\nBond Trading Matters On\nApril 28, 2021, the\nEuropean Commission\nconcluded its\ninvestigation regarding\ntrading by various\nfinancial institutions\nin sovereign,\nsupranational, and\nagency bonds by issuing\na fine in an amount not\nmaterial to the\nCorporation.
