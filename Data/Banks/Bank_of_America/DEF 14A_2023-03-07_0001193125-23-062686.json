                    \nProxy statement summary Governance objectives Our Board of Directors oversees the \ndevelopment and execution of our strategy. The Board has adopted robust governance\npractices and processes consistent with our focus on driving Responsible Growth.  \nOur Board has implemented a number of measures to enrich Board composition,       \nenhance independent oversight, and increase its effectiveness. These measures     \nalign our corporate governance structure with achieving our strategic objectives, \nand enable our Board to oversee our culture of compliance and rigorous risk       \nmanagement.

Our    \nInvestor Relations team regularly meets with investors, prospective investors, and\ninvestment analysts. These meetings often include participation by our Chair and  \nCEO, Chief Financial Officer, or line of business leaders, and they generally     \ndiscuss how we drive our strategy and deliver for shareholders by focusing on     \nResponsible Growth. In addition to the Investor Relations meetings, our Board and \nmanagement also routinely engage with our shareholders and other stakeholders.    \nThroughout 2022 and into 2023, we provided direct updates about our Board and our \ncompany to our 250 largest shareholders representing approximately 61% of our     \nshares outstanding and to key stakeholders. During that same time period, our Lead\nIndependent Director and senior management, including our Chief Human Resources   \nOfficer and Chief Administrative Officer, met with shareholders representing 2.5  \nbillion of our shares outstanding (or approximately 52% of our shares outstanding \nheld by institutional shareholders) and with other stakeholders to solicit their  \ninput on important corporate governance, executive compensation, and              \nsustainability matters, including diversity and inclusion, economic opportunity,  \nhuman capital management, and climate risk management. This ongoing exchange      \ninforms our Board\u2019s meeting agendas, and contributes to governance and disclosure \nenhancements that help us address the issues our shareholders and key stakeholders\ntell us matter most to them. This engagement process is an important part of how  \nwe drive progress on our corporate governance objectives and our human capital,   \ncompensation, environmental, and other sustainability initiatives. Importantly,   \nthis engagement process complements Responsible Growth and assists us in achieving\nour strategic objectives, creating long-term value, maintaining our culture of    \ncompliance, and contributing to our sustainability activities. Lionel Nowell, our \nLead Independent Director, is an integral part of our year-round shareholder      \nengagement process. Since being named the Lead Independent Director successor in  \nthe fall of 2020, he has participated in over 110 meetings with investors.

Our performance considerations include both  \nfinancial and non-financialmeasures\u2014including the manner in which results are     \nachieved. These considerations reinforce and promote Responsible Growth and       \nmaintain alignment with our Risk Framework. Our executive compensation program    \nprovides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align        \nexecutive officer and shareholder interests. A majority of total variable         \ncompensation granted to named executive officers is in deferred equity-based      \nawards, further encouraging long-term focus on generating sustainable growth.     \n                                                      \n  By focusing on Responsible Growth, we continued to  \n  deliver strong results in 2022                      \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                          In recognition of our overall company   \n                                          performance in delivering Responsible   \n                                          Growth, and the CEO\u2019s individual        \n                                          performance, the Compensation and       \n                                          Human Capital Committee and the         \n                                          Board\u2019s independent directors           \n                                          determined the following 2022           \n                                          compensation for our CEO:               \n  \u2022 Total compensation, inclusive of                                              \n  base                                                                            \n  salary and equity-based incentives, of                                          \n  $30.0 million, compared to 2021 total                                           \n  compensation of $32.0 million \u2022 Based                                           \n  on                                                                              \n  shareholder input and our Board\u2019s                                               \n  assessment, pay structure is unchanged                                          \n  from prior years \u2022 95% of Mr.                                                   \n  Moynihan\u2019s                                                                      \n  total compensation is variable and                                              \n  directly linked to company                                                      \n  performance.                                                                    \n  All CEO variable compensation was                                               \n  awarded in equity (as it has been                                               \n  since                                                                           \n  2010) \u2022 Half of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s                                                  \n  variable                                                                        \n  compensation is performance restricted                                          \n  stock units (PRSUs) that must be                                                \n  re-earned based on sustained                                                    \n  three-year                                                                      \n  average performance of key metrics                                              \n  (return on assets and growth in                                                 \n  adjusted                                                                        \n  tangible book value) \u2022 The remainder                                            \n  of                                                                              \n  the CEO\u2019s variable pay is 30%                                                   \n  cash-settled restricted stock units                                             \n  (CRSUs) and 20% time-based restricted                                           \n  stock units (TRSUs) settled in stock;

We deliver on this commitment by fostering a diverse and inclusive     \nworkplace so our workforce reflects the communities we serve, attracting and      \ndeveloping exceptional talent, expanding our benefits and resources to support the\nphysical, emotional, and financial wellness of our teammates and their families,  \nrecognizing and rewarding performance, and providing a competitive starting wage. \nTo promote transparency, accountability, and continued progress, we hold ourselves\naccountable each year by using third-parties to validate equal pay for equal work \nand by asking our workforce to tell us how we are doing in our Employee           \nSatisfaction Survey, which includes a diversity and inclusion component. Our focus\non being a great place to work is highlighted in the Human Capital Management     \nupdate in our 2022 Annual Report, which accompanies this proxy statement, and is  \ndescribed in further detail in \u201cBeing a great place to work,\u201d starting on page 43.\nOur commitment to sharing our success Sharing success in our communities. For     \nResponsible Growth to be sustainable, we must share our success with the          \ncommunities in which we work and live. We do this in numerous ways. We help       \nprovide economic opportunities for diverse people and communities through access  \nto lending and capital for homeowners, business owners, and entrepreneurs. Through\nour philanthropic partnerships, we focus on improving the lives of individuals and\nfamilies by investing in basic needs, such as healthcare and hunger relief,       \nworkforce development, and education, while also strengthening broader community  \nvitality by addressing needs related to affordable housing, small businesses, and \nneighborhood revitalization. Our commitment and how we share success with our     \ncommunities is dynamic and multifaceted. Read about it in more detail in our 2022 \nAnnual Report and under \u201cSharing success with our communities,\u201d starting on page  \n39. Helping reach a clean energy future. Consistent with our drive for Responsible\nGrowth, we continue to make progress on our strategy to support and finance the   \njust transition in every dimension to an environmentally sustainable, low-        \ncarboneconomy. This includes setting and disclosing milestone targets, engaging   \nwith clients to support their transition, investing in climate solutions,         \ndeveloping and reporting decision-useful metrics to drive progress, leading       \nindustry collaborations, and following guidance for transparency. We strive to be \ntransparent and accountable, reporting on our climate goals and progress,         \nincluding in our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework, our Approach to  \nZero, and our 2022 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)     \nReport.

All       \nnominees currently serve as directors on our Board. Other than Mr. Jos\u00e9 (Joe) E.  \nAlmeida, who was appointed to our Board in September 2022, all nominees were      \nelected by you at our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. Each director elected  \nat the meeting will serve until our 2024 annual meeting or until a successor is   \nduly elected and qualified. Each director nominee has consented to being named in \nthis proxy statement and to serving as a director if elected. If any nominee is   \nunable to stand for election for any reason, the shares represented at our annual \nmeeting may be voted for another candidate proposed by our Board, or our Board may\nchoose to reduce its size. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that an    \nindividual who would be age 75 as of the time of election shall not be nominated  \nfor initial election to the Board, provided that the Board may approve the        \nnomination for reelection of a director who would be age 75 at the time of the    \nelection, if, in light of all the circumstances, the Board determines that it is  \nin the best interests of our company and shareholders. Current director R. David  \nYost, who has reached the retirement age of 75, is not standing for reelection and\nwill retire at our annual meeting. In connection with Mr. Yost\u2019s retirement, the  \nsize of our Board will be reduced to 14 as of the annual meeting. We provide an   \noverview of the 14 nominees in the table below, including select skills and       \nqualifications and the self-disclosed diversity attributes for each nominee.

Our Board provides active and   \nindependent oversight of management. To carry out its responsibilities and set the\nappropriate tone at the top, our Board is keenly focused on the character,        \nintegrity, and qualifications of its members, and its leadership structure and    \ncomposition. Our Board believes our directors best serve our company and          \nshareholders by possessing high personal integrity and character, demonstrated    \nmanagement and leadership ability, extensive experience within our industry and   \nacross sectors, and the ability to exercise their sound and independent judgment  \nin a collegial manner. Our Board seeks directors whose complementary knowledge,   \nexperience, and skills provide a broad range of perspectives and leadership       \nexpertise in financial services and other global, highly complex and regulated    \nindustries, strategic planning and business development, business operations,     \nmarketing and distribution, technology, cybersecurity, risk management and        \nfinancial controls, human capital management, corporate governance, public policy,\nand other areas important to our company\u2019s strategy and oversight. Our Board      \nassesses directors\u2019 age and tenure, and Board continuity; it strives to achieve a \nbalance between the perspectives of new directors and those of longer-serving     \ndirectors with industry and institutional insights. Our Board also evaluates      \nwhether directors are able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties \nconsidering the time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its          \ncommittees. Our Board views diversity as a priority and seeks representation      \nacross a range of attributes. It regularly assesses our Board\u2019s diversity when    \nidentifying and evaluating director candidates. In addition, our Corporate        \nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee follows applicable regulations in   \nconfirming that our Board includes members who are independent, possess financial \nliteracy and expertise, an understanding of risk management principles, policies, \nand practices, and have experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk   \nexposures. Our current Board, including the 14 director nominees, reflects the    \nBoard\u2019s commitment to identify, evaluate, and nominate candidates who possess     \npersonal qualities, qualifications, skills, and diversity of backgrounds, and     \nprovide a mix of tenures that, when taken together, best serve our company and our\nshareholders. See \u201cElecting Directors\u201d on page 8 and \u201cOur director nominees\u201d on   \npage 12.                                                                          \n                             \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    9  \n                             \nProposal 1: Electing directors Succession planning and the director recruitment   \nprocess Our Board regularly reviews and renews its composition. Our Corporate     \nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee is responsible for identifying and  \nrecommending director candidates to our Board for nomination using a director     \nselection process that has been reviewed and acknowledged by our primary bank     \nregulators. The Board, in coordination with the Board committees, also regularly  \nconsiders Board leadership succession planning and committee membership           \ncomposition. Assess. The Committee regularly reviews the mix of individual        \ndirectors on our Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among other       \nfactors, the Committee considers our company\u2019s strategy and needs; our directors\u2019 \nexperiences, diversity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and qualifications our\nBoard identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria for potential        \ncandidates and assess whether these attributes and qualifications are additive to \nour overall Board composition. To maintain a vibrant mixture of viewpoints, and   \nbenefit from the fresh perspectives brought by new directors and the institutional\nknowledge and industry insights of directors having longer experience on our      \nBoard, the Committee reviews measures that enhance the Board\u2019s succession planning\nprocess, including the appropriate retirement age and related tenure limitations, \nand ability to commit the time necessary in service to our company. For additional\ninformation on the average tenure of directors serving on our Board and each      \ndirector\u2019s tenure, see \u201cOur director nominees\u201d on page 12. For additional details \non Boardoversight of our directors\u2019 time commitment, see \u201cDirector time           \ncommitment\u201d on the next page. Identify. To drive effective Board renewal and      \ndirector and Board leadership succession planning, the Committee has a regularly  \nrecurring agenda item to develop and review a diverse group of potential director \ncandidates. Based on the factors and criteria developed in the assessment phase,  \nthe Committee engages third-party search firms to identify potential candidates   \nfor review. It considers and provides feedback on the then- current pool of       \ndirector talent identified by search firms. The search firms periodically update  \nthe list of potential director candidates based on Committee and Board input. In  \n2022, the Committee continued to develop the pool of potential director candidates\nusing multiple external search firms. In its work with the external search firms, \nthe Committee emphasizes the importance of diversity by requesting the inclusion  \nof diverse candidates in its consideration of potential directors. Potential      \ndirector candidates possess professional experiences and racial, ethnic, gender,  \nnationality, and other relevant attributes aligned with Committee-specified       \ncriteria and with the qualities identified by our Board in recent self-           \nevaluations. See \u201cBoard evaluation\u201d on page 26 for additional information on our  \nBoard\u2019s self-evaluation process. The Committee also considers candidates proposed \nby management and by our shareholders. In 2022, Mr. Almeida was identified by an  \nexternal search firm for inclusion in the pool of potential director candidates,  \nand was appointed to the Board following Committee evaluation and nomination.     \n                         \n  10    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 1: Electing directors Evaluate. The Committee has an established process \nfor evaluating director candidates that it follows regardless of who recommends   \nthe candidate for consideration. During this process, the Committee reviews       \navailable or self-identified information regarding each candidate, including, but \nnot limited to, professional qualifications, experience, and expertise, as well as\nrace, ethnicity, gender, nationality, national origin, sexual orientation,        \nmilitary service, and other diverse characteristics. The Committee also reviews   \nthe candidate\u2019s independence, absence of conflicts, and any reputational risk     \nconsiderations. Our Board understands the time commitment involved in serving on  \nthe Board and its committees. The Committee assesses directors\u2019 time commitment to\nthe Board throughout the year, including through the annual formal self-evaluation\nprocess. The Committee evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able\nto devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors, taking into  \naccount primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other               \nresponsibilities. Prior to the annual renomination of currently serving directors,\nthe Committee also assesses these factors. Once elected, directors are expected to\nseek Committee approval prior to joining the board of another public company.     \nDirectors who change principal occupations must offer to resign from the Board,   \nsubject to further evaluation by the Committee and the Lead Independent Director. \nRecommend. The Board selected our 14 director nominees based on their satisfaction\nof the core attributes described on pages 9 and 10, and the belief that each can  \ncontinue making substantial contributions to our Board and company. Our Board     \nbelieves our nominees\u2019 breadth of experience and their diversity and mix of       \nattributes strengthen our Board\u2019s independent leadership and effective oversight  \nof management, in the context of our company\u2019s businesses, our industry\u2019s         \noperating environment, and our company\u2019s long-term strategy.                      \n                                                       \n  Director diversity In its work with the external     \n  search firms, the Committee emphasizes the           \n  importance of diversity by requesting the            \n  inclusion of diverse candidates in its               \n  consideration of potential directors. When           \n  evaluating director candidates, the Committee        \n  reviews available or self-identified information     \n  regarding each candidate, including, but not         \n  limited to, professional qualifications,             \n  experience, and expertise, as well as race,          \n  ethnicity, gender, nationality, national origin,     \n  sexual orientation, military service, and other      \n  diverse characteristics. Director time commitment    \n  Through the Committee, the Board regularly reviews   \n  and closely monitors shareholders\u2019 views on the      \n  appropriate number of public company boards on       \n  which directors may serve. The Committee considers:  \n  the proxy voting guidelines of our major             \n  shareholders; input from our shareholders during     \n  our engagement discussions; voting policies of the   \n  major proxy advisory firms; corporate governance     \n  guidelines adopted by other public companies;        \n  board trends at peer and other significant public    \n  companies; and advice from outside advisors. In      \n  2022, at the Committee\u2019s recommendation, our Board   \n  amended its policy on outside board service set      \n  forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The    \n  revised policy limits the maximum number of public   \n  company boards on which a director on our Board      \n  may serve to four public companies (including our    \n  Board), and specifies that any public company        \n  chief executive officer who serves as a director     \n  on our Board may not serve on the boards of more     \n  than two public companies (including our Board).     \n  In early 2023, the Committee reviewed the            \n  directors\u2019 time commitments, including their         \n  leadership roles on other public company boards as   \n  well as their private company and non-profit board   \n  service, where applicable. The Committee also        \n  reviewed the publicly available voting policies of   \n  our largest investors that address director time     \n  commitment and overboarding. All of our directors    \n  and director nominees comply with the Board\u2019s        \n  outside board service policy.                        \n                                                       \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    11  \n                              \nProposal 1: Electing directors Our director nominees Our director nominees        \nrepresent a diverse range of qualifications and skills:                           \n                                                                                  \n       They are seasoned leaders who have held an array of leadership positions   \n  \u2022    in complex, highly regulated businesses (including banks and other         \n       financial services organizations)                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    They have served as chief executives and in senior positions in the areas  \n       of risk, operations, finance, technology, and human capital                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       They bring deep and diverse experience in public and private companies,    \n  \u2022    financial services, academia, the public sector, nonprofit organizations,  \n       and other domestic and international businesses                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                          \n  \u2022    They represent diverse backgrounds and viewpoints  \n                                                          \n                                                                                  \n       They are experienced in regulated, non-financial services industries and   \n       organizations, adding to our Board\u2019s understanding of overseeing a         \n  \u2022    business subject to governmental oversight, and enhancing the diversity    \n       of our Board with valuable insights and fresh perspectives that            \n       complement those of our directors with specific experience in banking or   \n       financial services                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       They strengthen our Board\u2019s oversight capabilities by having varied        \n  \u2022    lengths of tenure that provide historical and new perspectives about our   \n       company                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  12    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 1: Electing directors                                                    \n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d each of the 14  \n  nominees listed below for election as a director  \n  (Proposal 1).                                     \n                                                    \nSet forth below are each nominee\u2019s name, age as of our annual meeting date,       \nprincipal occupation, business experience, and U.S.-listed public company         \ndirectorships held during the past five years.

Audit Committee, Compensation  \nand Human Capital Committee, and Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability    \nCommittee to be independent. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Enhanced Prudential      \nStandards require the chair of our Enterprise Risk Committee to be independent. In\naddition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require a substantial majority of   \nour directors to be independent. Our Board has adopted Director Independence      \nCategorical Standards (Categorical Standards), published on our website at        \nhttp://investor.bankofamerica.com, to assist it in determining each director\u2019s    \nindependence. Our Board considers directors or director nominees \u201cindependent\u201d if \nthey meet the criteria for independence in both the NYSE listing standards and our\nCategorical Standards. In early 2023, our Board, in coordination with our         \nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, evaluated the relevant   \nrelationships between each director or director nominee (and his or her immediate \nfamily members and affiliates) and Bank of America Corporation and its            \nsubsidiaries, and affirmatively determined that all of our directors and director \nnominees are independent, except for Mr. Moynihan due to his employment by our    \ncompany. Specifically, the following directors and director nominees are          \nindependent under the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards: Ms.   \nAllen, Mr. Almeida, Mr. Bramble, Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Ms. Hudson, Ms. Lozano, \nMr. Nowell, Ms. Ramos, Dr. Rose, Mr. White, Mr. Woods, Mr. Yost, and Dr. Zuber. In\naddition, each of Susan S. Bies and Thomas J. May, who retired from our Board at  \nthe 2022 annual meeting, qualified as independent during their service on the     \nBoard. In making its independence determinations, our Board considered the        \nfollowing ordinary course, non-preferentialrelationships that existed during the  \npreceding three years and those applicable transactions reported under \u201cRelated   \nperson and certain other transactions\u201d on page 47, and determined that none of the\nrelationships for the directors and director nominees set forth below constituted \na material relationship between the director or director nominee and our company: \n                                                                                  \n       Our company or its subsidiaries provided ordinary course financial         \n       products and services to all of our directors and director nominees, some  \n       of their immediate family members, and entities affiliated with some of    \n       them or their immediate family members (Mr.\u00a0Almeida, Mr.\u00a0de Weck, Mr.\u00a0     \n  \u2022    Donald, and Dr.\u00a0Rose). In each case, the fees we received for these        \n       products and services were below the thresholds of the NYSE listing        \n       standards and our Categorical Standards, and, where applicable, were less  \n       than 2% of the consolidated gross annual revenues of our company and of    \n       the other entity.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our company or its subsidiaries purchased products or services in the      \n       ordinary course from entities where some of our directors and director     \n       nominees are executive officers or employees or their immediate family     \n  \u2022    members serve or served in the past three years as executive officers      \n       (Mr.\u00a0Almeida, Mr.\u00a0Donald, Dr.\u00a0Rose, and Mr.\u00a0Woods). In each case, the      \n       fees paid to each of these entities were below the thresholds of the NYSE  \n       listing standards and our Categorical Standards.                           \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    23  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Independent board leadership Our Board is committed to       \nobjective, independent leadership for our Board and each of its committees. Our   \nBoard views the active, objective, independent oversight of management as central \nto effective Board governance, to serving the best interests of our company and   \nour shareholders, and to executing our strategic objectives and creating long-term\nvalue. This commitment is reflected in our company\u2019s governing documents,         \nincluding our Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the governing      \ndocuments of each of the Board\u2019s committees. Our Board leadership structure Our   \nBoard\u2019s optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company\u2019s\nevolving needs, strategy, and operating environment; changes in our Board\u2019s       \ncomposition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of\nshareholders and other stakeholders. In accordance with a 2014 amendment to our   \nBylaws that was ratified by our shareholders at a 2015 special meeting called     \nsolely for that purpose, our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board     \nleadership structure best suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and\nour Board. Our shareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing this flexibility\nby voting against shareholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments requiring an     \nindependent Chair at each of our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of shareholders. At\nleast annually, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, deliberates on and discusses the appropriate Board      \nleadership structure, including the considerations described above. Under our     \nBoard\u2019s current leadership structure, we have a Chair and a Lead Independent      \nDirector. Our Lead Independent Director is empowered with and exercises, robust,  \nwell-defined duties. Our Board is composed of experienced and committed           \nindependent directors (with all non-managementnominees being independent). Our    \nBoard committees have objective, experienced chairs and members. All our directors\nare required to stand for election annually. Our Board, under leadership of the   \nLead Independent Director, is committed to engaging with shareholders and other   \nstakeholders. Our Board believes that these factors, taken together, provide for  \nobjective, independent Board leadership; effective engagement with and oversight  \nof management; and a voice that is independent from management and accountable to \nshareholders and other stakeholders. Our Lead Independent Director, together with \nthe other independent directors, exemplifies objective, independent Board         \nleadership, and effectively engages and oversees management. The Lead Independent \nDirector is joined by experienced, independent Board members and a Chair who, as  \nCEO, serves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term strategy and our     \nResponsible Growth. The independent directors provide objective oversight of      \nmanagement, review the CEO\u2019s performance, determine and approve CEO compensation, \nhelp to establish our long-term strategy and regularly assess its effectiveness,  \nand serve the best interests of our company and our shareholders by overseeing    \nmanagement\u2019s work to create long-term value. Our Board, through its annual        \nassessment, with input from shareholders, believes that the existing structure    \ncontinues to be the optimal leadership framework at this time. As a highly        \nregulated global financial services company, we and our shareholders benefit from \nan executive Chair with deep experience and leadership in and knowledge of the    \nfinancial services industry, our company, its businesses, and our focus on        \nResponsible Growth. Our Chair is also a global leader who is helping drive        \nprogress towards the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG),      \nincluding serving on (and formerly chairing) the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF)     \nInternational Business Council, which is leading efforts on standardization of UN \nSDG disclosures, and is chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative. We and our   \nshareholders also benefit from a Lead Independent Director who is empowered (see  \nnext page for a list of the defined duties) and highly engaged; holds regular     \nmeetings with our primary regulators, our independent directors, and our CEO and  \nother management members; and plays a leading role in our shareholder engagement  \nprocess (see page 35). In recognition of his leadership and independence, in 2022,\nMr. Nowell was named \u201cIndependent Director of the Year\u201d by Corporate Board Member.\n                                                      \n  Highly engaged Lead Independent Director            \n  The formalized list of duties of the Lead           \n  Independent Director (see next page) does not       \n  fully capture Mr. Nowell\u2019s active role as our       \n  Board\u2019s independent leader.

In addition, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and      \nSustainability Committee has a process for implementing an orderly independent    \ndirector leadership transition for our Lead Independent Director. Mr. Nowell was  \nnamed as the successor to our retiring Lead Independent Director in the fall of   \n2020, following an orderly succession planning process overseen by our Corporate  \nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, and assumed his role as Lead       \nIndependent Director in April 2021 upon his reelection to the Board by            \nshareholders at the 2021 annual meeting. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell \nregularly meets with our CEO and key regulators, and meets quarterly with each    \nindependent director and other key members of management, including our Chief Risk\nOfficer and our Chief Human Resources Officer. He also regularly attends the      \ncompany\u2019s shareholder engagement meetings and since fall 2020, has joined 110     \nmeetings with investors holding approximately 57% of our company\u2019s outstanding    \ninstitutional shares.

\n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    25  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Board evaluation Our Board and our Board committees regularly\nevaluate their own effectiveness throughout the year. The evaluation is a         \nmultifaceted process that includes quarterly one-on-onediscussions between each   \ndirector and our Lead Independent Director, individual director input on agenda   \ntopics for Board and committee meetings and strategic planning sessions, executive\nsessions held in Board and committee meetings without management present, periodic\ninput to our CEO and senior management on enhancements to Board and committee     \neffectiveness, and an annual formal self-evaluation process developed and         \nadministered under the direction of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and            \nSustainability Committee. Formal self-evaluation Research commissioned by the     \nBoard on the characteristics of highly effective and efficient boards identified  \nfive key areas where the research suggested high functioning boards and committees\nexcelled: board and committee composition; board culture; board and committee     \nfocus; board process; and information and resources. Composition. Through the     \nself-evaluation process, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills, and     \nexperiences of potential director candidates that are consistent with the         \ncompany\u2019s current strategy and Responsible Growth, that allow the Board to        \neffectively perform its risk oversight responsibilities, and that would add to the\nBoard\u2019s diversity. Our Board also assesses its overall director recruitment and   \nsuccession planning processes and committee composition. Board culture. Our Board \nconsiders its role in setting the standard for the company\u2019s culture and values by\nforging a collegial and collaborative dynamic that values independent judgment and\nemphasizes accountability. As part of this review, directors evaluate how they    \ninteract among themselves and with management, including the importance of        \nchallenging and holding management accountable. This past year, the self-         \nevaluation included a focus on enhancing Board engagement as the company emerges  \nfrom the pandemic operating environment.                                          \n                         \n  26    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Focus. Our Board and committees consider their effectiveness \nin performing key oversight responsibilities in a number of areas, including:     \nstrategy; risk; environmental and social sustainability; and management talent and\nsuccession planning. They continuously evaluate the sufficiency of information    \nreceived and the time spent in these areas. They regularly reassess their         \noversight focus by engaging in dialogue with management, soliciting feedback from \nshareholders and other stakeholders, and receiving third-party perspectives on the\ncompetitive environment, opportunities for growth, macroeconomic trends, and      \ngeopolitics. Process. As part of the formal self-evaluation process, directors    \nreview overall Board and committee structure, the allocation of meeting time,     \ncadence of meetings, and other meeting processes. In addition, outside of our     \nformal self-evaluation process, each of our directors also meets with management  \nand with our Lead Independent Director through a combination of executive         \nsessions, smaller group sessions, and one-on-onemeetings. Directors are focused on\nBoard and committee meeting structure so as to allow ample time for discussion,   \ndebate, and in-depthreview of key topics and trends, and to facilitate focus on   \nstrategic topics. Information and resources. Through the self-evaluation process, \nour Board and committees evaluate the quality of meeting materials and            \npresentations and the overall amount and type of information, education, and      \ntraining opportunities they receive both from management and outside advisors and \nexperts. Our directors continue to highlight the need for clear, comprehensive,   \nand concise information to effectively support their oversight responsibilities,  \nincluding understandable and streamlined materials that identify key issues. Our  \nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee considered industry       \ntrends, practices of our peers, feedback from shareholders, and regulatory        \ndevelopments in creating the formal 2022 self-evaluation. The formal 2022 self-   \nevaluation solicited directors\u2019 views on topics in each of the five key areas of  \nboard effectiveness, including topics covering our company\u2019s current operating    \nenvironment, input from shareholders learned during engagement discussions, and   \nareas of opportunity. As part of its ongoing review of Board and committee        \ncomposition, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee also     \ncontinued to seek input on the Board\u2019s director succession planning process,      \nincluding Board and committee leadership succession planning. Results are shared  \nwith management, as appropriate, to assist the Board and committees in making     \nenhancements to address opportunities identified. Enhancements made in response to\nformal Board self-evaluations In response to feedback solicited from our Board and\ncommittees in 2022, we continue to:

            \nCorporate Governance Director education Our director education is vital to the    \nability of directors to fulfill their roles, and supports Board members in their  \ncontinuous learning. The Board encourages directors to participate annually in    \nexternal continuing director education programs, and our company reimburses       \ndirectors for their expenses associated with this participation. Our directors    \nalso attend forums and conferences convened by our primary banking regulators.    \nContinuing director education is also provided during Board meetings and other    \nBoard discussions as part of the formal meetings, and as stand- alone information \nsessions outside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2022, our Board heard    \nfrom our primary banking regulators, research academics, an economist and former  \ncabinet-level member of the U.S. government\u2019s executive branch, and from          \nmanagement on numerous subjects, including cybersecurity, climate risk, human     \ncapital management and diversity and inclusion, geopolitical events, the          \nmacroeconomic environment, and many related considerations. All new directors also\nparticipate in our director orientation program during their first six months on  \nour Board. New directors have a series of meetings over time with management      \nrepresentatives from all of our business and staff areas to review and discuss,   \nwith increasing detail, information about our company, industry, and regulatory   \nframework, as well as compliance training. Based on input from our directors, we  \nbelieve this gradual on-boardingapproach over the first six months of Board       \nservice, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee meetings,      \nprovides new directors with a strong foundation in our company\u2019s businesses,      \nconnects directors with members of management with whom they will interact and    \noversee, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in Board             \ndeliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and educational    \nopportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on the Board  \nand in committees. CEO and senior management succession planning Our Board        \noversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed\nat least annually; two such planning sessions were held in 2022. Our CEO and our  \nChief Human Resources Officer provide our Board with recommendations and          \nevaluations of potential CEO successors, and review their development progress.   \nOur Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our CEO and\nour Chief Human Resources Officer, including the qualifications, experience, and  \ndevelopment priorities for these individuals. Directors engage with potential CEO \nand senior management successors at Board and committee meetings and in less      \nformal settings to allow directors to personally assess candidates. Further, our  \nBoard periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management\u2019s     \nqualifications, tenure, and experience. In 2022, the Board also reviewed          \nstrategies for enhancing representation of diverse teammates at senior levels of  \nthe company and professional development for managers and senior leaders,         \nincluding in each of our eight lines of business and staff areas. Our Board also  \nestablishes steps to address emergency CEO planning in extraordinary              \ncircumstances. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our    \ncompany to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting    \nfrom a major catastrophe, by continuing our company\u2019s safe and sound operation and\nminimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our company\u2019s business   \nand operations.                                                                   \n                                                      \n  Board meetings and attendance Directors are         \n  expected to attend our annual meetings of           \n  shareholders and our Board and committee meetings.  \n  Each of our incumbent directors and nominees        \n  attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of  \n  our Board and the committees on which they served   \n  during 2022. In addition, all of the directors      \n  serving on our Board at the time of our 2022        \n  annual meeting attended the meeting. Our            \n  independent directors regularly meet privately in   \n  executive session without our Chair and CEO or      \n  other members of management present, and held 13    \n  such executive sessions in connection with Board    \n  meetings in 2022. Our Lead Independent Director     \n  leads these Board executive sessions.               \n                                                      \nCommittees and membership Our Board has four committees. Charters describing the  \nresponsibilities of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee, Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, and Enterprise\nRisk Committee can be found at http://investor.bankofamerica.com, and their       \nmembership is set forth on the next page. Our Board committees regularly make     \nrecommendations and report on their activities to the entire Board. Each committee\nmay obtain advice from internal or external financial, legal, accounting, or other\nadvisors at their discretion. Our Board, in considering the recommendations of our\nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, reviews our committee    \ncharters and committee membership at least annually.

The Board and management regularly\nreview the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement for enhancements and        \nimprovements. The Risk Framework serves as the foundation for consistent and      \neffective risk management by setting forth clear roles, responsibilities, and     \naccountability for the management of risk and describing how our Board oversees   \nthe establishment of our risk appetite, which indicates the amount and type of    \nrisk our Board and management believe appropriate to achieve our strategic        \nobjectives and business plans. This framework of objective, independent Board     \noversight and management\u2019s robust risk management better enables us to serve our  \nclients, deliver long-term value for our shareholders and achieve our strategic   \nobjectives, and helps make our company a great place to work. Our Risk Framework  \noutlines the seven key types of risk that our company faces\u2014strategic risk, credit\nrisk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including third-party, model,\nconduct, technology, information security, and data risks), compliance risk, and  \nreputational risk. It also addresses climate risk and legal risk. It describes the\ncomponents of our risk management approach, including our culture of managing risk\nwell, risk appetite, and risk management processes, highlighting the              \nresponsibilities of all employees in managing risk. It also outlines our risk     \nmanagement governance structure, including the roles of our Board, management,    \nlines of business, independent risk management, and Corporate Audit within the    \ngovernance structure. Our Risk Appetite Statement formally articulates our        \ncompany\u2019s risk appetite and includes both qualitative components and quantitative \nlimits. The qualitative components describe our company\u2019s approach to managing    \nrisks in a manner consistent with Responsible Growth and the quantitative limits  \nindicate the aggregate amount of risk our company is willing to take.             \n                         \n  30    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Our risk governance structure Our directors have relevant    \nrisk management oversight experience; see \u201cElecting directors\u201d and \u201cOur director  \nnominees\u201d on pages 9 and 12.

The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance;  \n(ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory        \ndevelopments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the      \nCommittee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation    \nstatement, or \u201ctally sheet,\u201d for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect \neach executive officer\u2019s total compensation, including base salary, cash and      \nequity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards    \n(including the status of achieving any performance goals), qualified and          \nnonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit accruals, and the       \nincremental cost to our company of the executive\u2019s perquisites. The Committee uses\nthis information to evaluate all elements of compensation and benefits provided to\nan executive officer. The Committee also annually reviews market pay practices,   \nincluding compensation benchmarks at our primary competitor group, to evaluate    \nmarket trends and competitive pay levels for our executive officers. For          \nadditional information, see \u201cCompetitor groups\u201d section on page 66. Annually, the \nCommittee reviews with our Board its compensation decisions (including cash and   \nequity-based incentive awards, if applicable) for executives who report directly  \nto our CEO. With respect to the CEO\u2019s compensation, the Committee makes a         \nrecommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of\nthe Board. The CEO does not participate in Committee or Board deliberations about \nhis compensation. Additionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit        \nExecutive, the Committee\u2019s pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved  \nby our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.       \nExecutive officers do not engage with the Committee in setting the amount of their\nown individual compensation. During annual performance reviews for executive      \nofficers other than our CEO, the Committee considers our CEO\u2019s perspective and    \nincentive award recommendations before approving compensation for each of these   \nexecutive officers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our   \nvarious lines of business, business segments and functions, as well as performance\nfeedback from our Chief Human Resources Officer and our independent control       \nfunctions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, and    \nLegal). The Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its charter \nto approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for those    \nservices. The Committee retained Farient Advisors LLC (Farient Advisors) as its   \n2022 independent compensation consultant. Farient Advisors\u2019 business with us is   \nlimited to providing independent executive and director compensation consulting   \nservices. Farient Advisors does not provide any other services to our company. For\n2022, Farient Advisors provided the Committee external market and performance     \ncomparisons, advised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director         \ncompensation, assisted in evaluating program design, and assisted with other      \nexecutive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services,\nFarient Advisors met regularly with the Committee without management and privately\nwith the Chair of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to management certain \nduties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee    \ndelegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation   \nCommittee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO  \nand his direct reports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee      \nsubstantially all of our employee benefit plans.

Consistent with global regulatory          \ninitiatives, our Compensation Governance Policy requires that our incentive       \ncompensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking.                        \n                                                                                  \n                            Our Compensation                                      \n                            Governance Policy                                     \n                            addresses...                                          \n  \u2022 Definition and process                                                        \n  for identifying                                      \u2022\u2002\u2009Policies on incentive   \n  \u201crisk-taking\u201d employees                              compensation plan          \n  \u2022 Key goals and                                      effectiveness through      \n  process for incentive                                testing and monitoring to  \n  compensation plan                                    confirm that the plans     \n  design and governance to                             appropriately balance      \n  appropriately                                        risks with compensation    \n  balance risks with                                   outcomes, including        \n  compensation                                         developing processes to    \n  outcomes, including:                                 administer cancellations   \n  \u2022 funding incentive                                  and clawbacks \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        \n  compensation pools \u2022                                 Policies that provide for  \n  determining individual                               the independence of our    \n  incentive                                            company\u2019s independent      \n  compensation awards \u2022                                control functions and      \n  use of discretion                                    their appropriate input    \n  as part of those                                     to the Committee           \n  processes                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    33  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Compensation governance structure .Our compensation          \ngovernance structure allocates responsibility so that our Board, Compensation and \nHuman Capital Committee, or the appropriate management-level governing body makes \ncompensation decisions with documented input from the independent control         \nfunctions. This approach promotes effective oversight and review and facilitates  \nthe appropriate governance to balance risk and reward. Below is an illustration of\nour compensation governance structure, which is influenced by internal            \nconsiderations and external factors: Incentive plan certification process         \n.Pursuant to our Compensation Governance Policy, our annual incentive plan        \ncertification and review process provides for a comprehensive review, analysis,   \nand discussion of incentive design and operation. As part of the governance for   \nincentive plans, each of the CEO\u2019s direct reports, along with their management    \nteams and independent control functions (including their respective risk          \nofficers), meet periodically to discuss how business strategy, performance, and   \nrisk align to compensation. The relevant participants certify that the incentive  \nprograms they review: (i) are aligned with the applicable lines of business and   \nour company\u2019s business strategy and performance objectives; (ii) do not encourage \nexcessive or imprudent risk-taking beyond our company\u2019s ability to effectively    \nidentify and manage risk; (iii) are compatible with effective controls and risk   \nmanagement; and (iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary trading. Our    \nChief Risk Officer also certifies all incentive plans across our company as part  \nof the Management Compensation Committee\u2019s governance process. Farient Advisors   \nand the Compensation and Human Capital Committee review these management          \ncertifications. Incentive plan audit reviews .Corporate Audit annually reviews the\noperational effectiveness of the incentive compensation program, using a risk-    \nbased approach to evaluate plan design, pay execution, program governance, and    \nconformity with regulatory requirements. Conduct reviews. As part of our          \ncompensation governance practices, management reviews the results of the conduct  \nreview process so that conduct is consistently and appropriately considered in    \nperformance assessments and pay decisions across the company. These performance   \nand pay outcomes are reviewed at least annually by the Committee. Independent     \ncontrol function feedback .In addition to reviewing the individual incentive      \ncompensation awards for executive officers and other senior executives who report \ndirectly to the CEO, the Committee also reviews the outcomes of our control       \nfunction feedback process and individual incentive compensation awards for certain\nhighly compensated employees. As part of its governance process, the Committee    \nmeets with the heads of our independent control functions and business lines to   \ndiscuss their feedback on the pay-for-performanceprocess, including how risk      \nmanagement and conduct matters were factored into compensation decisions. These   \nprocesses and reviews, in combination with risk management and clawback features, \nare key components of our compensation programs. These programs are designed to   \nappropriately hold employees accountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a  \nway that does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking or create risks    \nthat are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.      \nHedging policy .Under our Code of Conduct and other policies, all Bank of America \ndirectors, executive officers, and certain other designated insiders are          \nprohibited from hedging and speculative trading of Bank of America securities.    \nThey may not engage in short sales or trading in puts, calls, and other options or\nderivatives with respect to our securities. All other employees may not engage in \nany such transactions other than transactions that hedge against an existing long \nposition in our securities if the shares underlying the position are readily      \navailable for sale or delivery. No employee may hedge the value of outstanding    \nrestricted stock units or other equity-based awards, and such awards may be       \nforfeited or recouped for violation of our anti-hedging and derivative            \ntransactions policies.

In 2022, the Board and  \nits committees discussed with management our work to drive growth in a sustainable\nmanner. For example, the Board received updates on our climate initiatives,       \nincluding our climate risk management practices and our sustainable finance       \nactivities, the results of our annual Employee Satisfaction Survey and our        \ninternal Diversity & Inclusion Index, and progress on our commitment to promote   \ndiversity and inclusion. The Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability        \nCommittee\u2019s discussions included our charitable giving and philanthropic          \ninvestments activities, the health equity initiative established under our $1.25  \nbillion racial equality and economic opportunity commitment, our community banking\ninitiatives, our sustainable finance activities, our 2030 targets for reducing    \nfinanced emissions and our 2022 TCFD Report. The Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee received updates, including our equal pay for equal work commitment, our\nnew employee sabbatical program, and disclosures about our human capital          \nmanagement practices. The Audit Committee received updates, including regulatory  \ndevelopments on sustainability-related financial disclosure requirements. And the \nEnterprise Risk Committee, among other things, amended its charter to clarify that\nits oversight encompasses climate risk. Listening to external perspectives To     \nbetter understand the needs of our clients and communities, we seek advice from a \nwide range of experts. We actively consult with independent third parties who     \nbring diverse perspectives to help us better serve our clients, make our company a\ngreat place to work, and share success with our communities and our stakeholders. \nWe convene with shareholders, industry leaders, consumer advocates, community     \nadvisors, thought leaders, and other stakeholders for their advice and guidance in\nshaping our policies and practices, and engage with our stakeholders in important \nassessments that identify and promote progress. Because we are an active          \nparticipant in each local community in which we operate, we understand its        \neconomy, culture, strengths, and challenges. Our efforts to deliver effective     \nsolutions and service by matching the right resources to each community\u2019s         \nindividual needs are informed by input received from community leaders, consumer  \nadvocates, and other local stakeholders.

For more             \n  information, see Proposal 11 on page 108.           \n  Outside perspectives from our National Community    \n  Advisory Council In 2005, we formed our National    \n  Community Advisory Council (NCAC), a forum          \n  comprised of senior leaders from social justice,    \n  consumer advocacy, community development,           \n  environmental organizations, and policy institutes  \n  from whom we solicit independent external           \n  perspectives, guidance, and feedback. The NCAC      \n  meets at least twice annually. Our CEO and senior   \n  management join these meetings regularly and our    \n  independent Board members, including our Lead       \n  Independent Director, have had the opportunity to   \n  meet and hear directly from our NCAC advisors. Our  \n  NCAC advisors provide multiple perspectives,        \n  engage in healthy debate and dialogue with us, and  \n  offer sound advice on critical issues affecting     \n  our clients, employees, and communities. Over the   \n  years, these advisors have informed our practices,  \n  policies, products and services in numerous areas;  \n  they are important and valuable voices helping us   \n  deliver Responsible Growth. \u2022 Consumer products     \n  and retail. The NCAC provided valuable feedback on  \n  the evolution of policies and practices in our      \n  efforts to reduce checking account fees, eliminate  \n  non-sufficient funds fees, and reduce clients\u2019      \n  reliance on overdraft. The NCAC\u2019s perspective on    \n  the needs of lower income customers helped inform   \n  the product development of SafeBalance Banking\u00ae,    \n  Affordable Loan SolutionTM, Better Money HabitsTM,  \n  and Balance AssistTM. It also provided perspective  \n  on key economic opportunity issues such as access   \n  to credit, financial literacy, affordable housing,  \n  and small business and mortgage lending. \u2022          \n  Workforce and jobs. Our engagement with the NCAC    \n  members led to the pilot and subsequent expansion,  \n  in partnership with UnidosUS, of Latinos in         \n  Finance, a workforce development program focused    \n  on training bilingual talent for financial center   \n  positions. Our NCAC advisors also provided input    \n  on our Pathways initiative designed to hire         \n  thousands of teammates from LMI communities. \u2022      \n  Racial equality and economic opportunity. The       \n  NCAC, especially those members focused on civil     \n  rights, community development, and consumer         \n  advocacy, helped inform the development of our      \n  $1.25 billion, five-year commitment to advance      \n  racial equality and economic opportunity. \u2022         \n  Environmental commitments. As we continue our work  \n  to address climate change and the demands on        \n  Earth\u2019s natural resources, our NCAC advisors have   \n  been instrumental in providing counsel and input,   \n  including how we deliver on our $1 trillion         \n  Environmental Business Initiative, and work to      \n  achieve our net zero goal in our financing,         \n  operations and supply chain before 2050. \u2022 Capital  \n  deployment. NCAC has helped inform our work over    \n  the years as we lead innovation and development in  \n  sustainable finance, including our leading $2       \n  billion portfolio of loans, deposits and            \n  investments in Community Development Financial      \n  Institutions (CDFIs).(1) For more information       \n  about our NCAC and its current membership, see      \n  https:                                              \n  //about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/key-  \n  -governance-topics.                                 \n                                                      \nSharing our success and making a global impact As a global financial institution, \nwe recognize that one of the most critical roles we can play is accelerating the  \ndeployment of capital to address the 17 UN SDGs which are directed toward building\na sustainable, prosperous future for all of us. There is a significant gap between\nthe amount of capital needed to address these global challenges and the amount    \nthat is being mobilized today. Private sector engagement is critical to closing   \nthis gap. Through the combined resources and expertise of the global financial    \ncommunity, governments, and nonprofit organizations, we are working to address    \nproblems through business decisions that improve our communities, generate growth,\nand lead to a return on investment. Sharing success with our communities          \nResponsible Growth that is sustainable includes sharing our success with our      \ncommunities. We do that strategically and holistically. As a company with national\nand global operations, our Board and management understand the need for real and  \nongoing progress on assessing and addressing diversity and inclusion and economic \ninequality in the United States. Our long-standing commitment to promote equality,\ndiversity and inclusion, and advance economic mobility includes multiple          \nstrategies from across our company. Through all of our activities, we drive       \npositive change within and outside our company. We enlist many independent third  \nparties for advice, counsel, perspective, ideas, and assistance. These third      \nparties and other stakeholders represent a range of diverse perspectives and      \nprovide continuous feedback on our actions and progress, holding us accountable.  \nOur Board and its Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee and     \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee provide governance and oversight to these\nefforts.

Effective management of climate risk requires     \ncoordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and well-     \ndeveloped processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks. We continue \nto build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. As climate risk\nis interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to      \nenhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework,   \nrisk appetite, and risk management programs established for strategic, credit,    \nmarket, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. Our           \nEnvironmental and Social Risk Policy Framework aligns with our Risk Framework and \nprovides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to            \nenvironmental and social risks, including climate risk. Our Environmental and     \nSocial Risk Policy Framework also helps define how we deploy capital and          \nresources. Our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk         \npractices and strategies by our Board, supported by the Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk   \nCommittee, as well as the Management Risk Committee and the Responsible Growth    \nCommittee, both of which are management-level committees comprised of senior      \nleaders across every major business lines and control function. The Responsible   \nGrowth Committee is supported by the ESG Disclosure sub-committee,which is        \nresponsible for reviewing and providing oversight of our company\u2019s climate and    \nsustainability-relatedpublic disclosures. Our climate risk management efforts are \noverseen by a senior executive who reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Climate \nRisk Council, which consists of leaders across risk, business lines, and control  \nfunctions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related    \nrisks in line with our Risk Framework.                                            \n                                                      \n  Transparency and accountability We are transparent  \n  and thorough in reporting on our climate goals and  \n  progress. We demonstrate our commitment to          \n  transparency by providing information about our     \n  approach to addressing climate change and managing  \n  risk through a number of reporting frameworks. For  \n  additional information, the following are           \n  available at https:                                 \n  //about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact:      \n  \u2022 Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework,   \n  which articulates our approach to environmental     \n  and social risks across our business, as well as    \n  outlining the environmental and social issues most  \n  relevant to us. \u2022 Approach to Zero, which sets      \n  forth our 2030 targets for reducing emissions       \n  associated with financing activities for three key  \n  sectors:                                            \n  auto manufacturing, energy and power generation \u2022   \n  2022 TCFD Report, which aims to use financial risk  \n  disclosures as a means to inform investors and      \n  other stakeholders about the risks companies,       \n  including ours, face related to climate change and  \n  how those risks/opportunities are being managed. \u2022  \n  ESG Data Performance Summary, which provides        \n  voluntary, comprehensive reporting with data        \n  across many facets of our sustainability and        \n  social responsibility work. The report is           \n  organized along the International Business Council  \n  stakeholder capitalism theme of People, Planet,     \n  Prosperity, and Principles of Governance, and       \n  includes our disclosure against the Global          \n  Reporting Initiative, or GRI, framework. \u2022          \n  Sustainability and social responsibility strategy,  \n  policies, and practices in our 2022 Annual Report,  \n  including our:                                      \n  - Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics developed by the   \n  International Business Council. - Sustainability    \n  Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Report, which     \n  provides disclosures aligned with the               \n  sustainability accounting standards set forth by    \n  SASB. \u2022 CDP Climate Change Report, CDP              \n  Verification Statement, and our response to the     \n  2022 CDP Climate Change Questionnaire. The report   \n  and the statement follow CDP, a global disclosure   \n  system for companies to manage their environmental  \n  impacts. More detailed information related to our   \n  CDP responses can be found in our TCFD Report.      \n  Many observers express different views on           \n  disclosures; for example there are several          \n  shareholder proposals in this proxy statement each  \n  seeking different disclosures. We encourage         \n  shareholders to review the disclosures above and    \n  described elsewhere in this proxy statement and     \n  our 2022 Annual Report. We believe the              \n  thoroughness and transparency in our disclosures    \n  do not require the additional, expensive and        \n  redundant disclosures sought by these proposals.    \n                                                      \nMore details on our approach to addressing the clean energy transition and        \nmanaging risk in our financing activities can be found in our 2022 Annual Report, \non the prior page, and in Proposals 8, 9, and 10 starting on page 98.             \n                         \n  42    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nResponsible Growth: Growth that is Sustainable Being a great place to work        \nResponsible Growth that is sustainable includes being a great place to work. We do\nthat strategically and holistically. Building a diverse and inclusive workplace We\nbelieve that our diversity makes us stronger, and our leaders embrace diversity   \nand inclusion as integral to our business success. Our commitment to a diverse and\ninclusive environment starts at the top with our Board and CEO and extends to all \nteammates. Our CEO and management team set the diversity and inclusion goals of   \nthe company. Each management team member has business-specific, action-oriented   \ndiversity goals, which are subject to our quarterly business review process, used \nas part of talent planning, and included in scorecards reviewed by the Board.     \nManagement team members cascade these goals across their organizations to support \ncommitment and accountability across the company. We hold all managers responsible\nfor driving a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment. We also provide\nopportunities for managers to sponsor and support rising talent to continue       \nbuilding our diverse workforce. Our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council,         \nestablished nearly 30 years ago, continues to promote diversity goal setting,     \nwhich is embedded in our performance management process at all levels of the      \norganization. The global council sponsors and supports business, operating unit,  \nand regional diversity and inclusion councils to provide alignment to enterprise  \ndiversity strategies and goals. Membership on the council consists of senior      \nexecutives from every line of business, every region, our local markets, and has  \nbeen chaired by Mr. Moynihan since 2007. Our Chief Diversity & Inclusion and      \nCorporate Social Responsibility Officer partners with our CEO and management team \nto drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, initiatives, programs, and         \npolicies.                                                                         \n                                                      \n  Transparency and accountability. We hold ourselves  \n  accountable for increasing diverse representation,  \n  including by disclosing our employment metrics and  \n  measuring progress across top management levels.    \n  We have built robust analytics and put processes    \n  in place at all levels of the company, including    \n  our top three management levels, to drive progress  \n  and accountability. And we report on our progress.  \n  \u2022 In November 2019, we published our first Human    \n  Capital Management Report with details on all we    \n  do to support our employees and their families and  \n  on our workforce diversity metrics over time. In    \n  October 2020, we followed up with an updated        \n  report to provide information on the steps we have  \n  taken during the global health crisis, our focus    \n  on hiring, developing, and retaining diverse        \n  talent and the additional steps we are taking to    \n  continue to build on our progress. \u2022 In our 2021    \n  Annual Report and again in our 2022 Annual Report,  \n  we include a Human Capital Management update        \n  section to continue to provide key information on   \n  our progress in being a great place to work. \u2022 We   \n  routinely disclose our company\u2019s EEO diversity      \n  statistics in order to publicly hold ourselves      \n  accountable and to confirm whether we are           \n  delivering on our commitment to increase diverse    \n  representation across the company wherever          \n  possible. See our 2022 Annual Report for our 2022   \n  EEO diversity statistics.                           \n                                                      \nOur company has built a diverse pipeline of candidates for positions at all levels\nof the company, including leadership positions, as demonstrated in our published  \nworkforce diversity metrics. For over a decade, our company has had a long-       \nstanding practice of utilizing diverse slates in order to grow diversity at senior\nlevels of the company. To further demonstrate our commitment to this long-standing\npractice, we have formalized the use of diverse candidate slates into a policy.   \nThe use of diverse slates at senior levels, among other broad based diversity     \npractices, has helped to drive strong progress against our aspirational goal for  \nour workforce to mirror the clients and communities we serve at all levels of the \ncompany. Our latest measures show improvement in the diversity of our leadership, \nmanagement and global workforce, including:                                       \n                                                                                  \n  57% of our Board\u2019s         55% of our\u00a0management       50% of our global        \n  director nominees          team                        workforce are women and  \n  are diverse,\u00a0including     is diverse(1), including    50% of our U.S.          \n  36% women.                 32% women.                  workforce are people of  \n                                                         color.(2)                \n  People of color in                                                              \n  executive/senior           Since 2015, our             Since 2009,              \n  level individual and       representation of people    representation of        \n  management                 of color in the top         people of color in our   \n  positions have             three management levels     Campus classes           \n  increased by 67% since     increased 73%.              increased 64%.           \n  2015.                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                             \n  (1)  Includes women and people of color; CEO included with Board nominees  \n                                                                             \n                  \n  (2)  U.S. only  \n                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    43  \n                              \nResponsible Growth: Growth that is Sustainable To help drive a culture of         \ninclusion, we have developed and provide employees with access to a range of      \nprograms and resources focused on building understanding and driving progress in  \nthe workplace, including our series of courageous conversations and inclusion     \nlearning and development programs that provide teammates with opportunities to    \ndiscuss topics central to who we are as individuals, including racial equality,   \neconomic opportunity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, military     \nservice, mental health, and more. Recruiting and developing talented teammates. A \nkey aspect of Responsible Growth is attracting and retaining exceptional talent   \nfrom around the world to our company. This starts with how we recruit new         \nemployees and extends to the many ways we support their professional development  \nand career growth. We partner with more than 450 universities across the globe to \nprovide entry-level opportunities through our campus program, including nearly 30 \nHispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as\nwell as 30 community colleges. In 2022, we onboarded 1,800 fulltime campus hires, \n44% women and 59% people of color; contributed $9.6 million to 50 national        \nworkforce training partners and nearly $31 million to date toward programs focused\non increasing diverse talent in high-growth areas; and hired more than 5,100 U.S. \nteammates with a military background. We are making progress on our commitment to \nhire an additional 10,000 LMI hires by 2025, bringing our total to 20,000 LMI     \nhires. We surpassed our initial goal of 10,000 hires three years early. We also   \nfocus on recruiting diverse talent, including military and veterans, LGBTQ+       \nindividuals, and people with disabilities. We are investing in teammates\u2019 career  \ngrowth and success through The Academy at Bank of America, our award-winning      \nonboarding, education, and professional development organization established in   \n2017. For our leaders and managers, we offer a range of development programs that \nprovide assessments, professional coaching, strategies, and tactics to help       \nleaders progress in their careers and strengthen our leader pipeline for future   \nroles. Promoting physical, emotional, and financial wellness We provide employees \nwith access to leading benefits and programs that help teammates be               \nwell\u2014physically, emotionally, and financially. This is core to our values and to  \nResponsible Growth, and we continue to evolve our benefits and programs over time \nto meet teammates where they are in their career and personal lives. Below are    \nrecent highlights of our benefits and programs that support the physical,         \nemotional, and financial wellness of our teammates. See our 2022 Annual Report for\nmore details. Physical wellness. To help our employees be physically well, we     \noffer health insurance plans that provide access to virtual care, condition       \nmanagement, and specialty programs and tools that help employees know how to      \nprevent illness and maintain wellness. We have held medical premiums flat for U.S.\nemployees earning less than $50,000 for the 10th year in a row. For the sixth     \nstraight year, employees earning between $50,000 and less than $100,000 saw       \npremium increases below the national average. Emotional wellness. Helping our     \nteammates be emotionally well means providing resources to help handle stress,    \nmanage conflicts and adversity, and deal with grief in positive, healthy ways.    \n                                                                                  \n       We expanded in-person confidential counseling through our Employee         \n       Assistance Program by adding onsite benefits counselors in some of our     \n  \u2022    large office locations, doubled the number of free in-person confidential  \n       counseling sessions to 12, and expanded virtual options to provide free    \n       unlimited, confidential 24/7 phone access to specialists for counseling.   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Life Events Services team helps provide teammates with personalized    \n  \u2022    connections to resources, by tapping experts inside and outside the        \n       company for significant events like domestic violence, natural disasters,  \n       terminal illness, retiring from the company, survivor support, and more.   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       We continued to provide 50 days of back-up childcare and eldercare when    \n       regular arrangements are unavailable.

We believe our pay-for-performanceapproach\u2014combined with our focus\non workforce representation\u2014will continue driving the advancement and             \nrepresentation of women and people of color in our company. We pay our employees  \nfairly based on market rates for their roles, experience, and how they perform,   \nand we regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our    \nindustry to help confirm our pay is competitive. We have a standard U.S. practice \nthat restricts the solicitation of compensation information from candidates during\nour hiring process so that we consider new hires for their individual             \nqualifications and roles, rather than how they may have been previously           \ncompensated. We are committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain robust     \npolicies and practices that reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews \nwith oversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 16 years, we have      \nconducted rigorous processes and analyses with outside experts to examine         \nindividual employee pay before year-endcompensation decisions are finalized, and  \nwe adjust compensation where appropriate. In 2022, our analyses show that we      \ncontinued to compensate our employees fairly and equitably as demonstrated through\nour equal pay for equal work review. Our review covered our regional leadership   \nhubs (U.S., U.K., France, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and India. Results of\nthis equal pay for equal work review showed that compensation received by women   \nwas on average more than 99% of that received by men, and that compensation       \nreceived by people of color in the U.S. was on average more than 99% of that      \nreceived by non-people of color employees.

Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great place to work. We     \nbelieve our employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement    \nresults and how our teammates view Bank of America as an employer of choice. Over \nthe past decade, our turnover rate has been among the lowest in the industry. In  \nthat time, we have experienced vastly different labor markets, the pandemic, and  \nreturn to office. With the tight labor market in 2022, we saw a slight increase in\nturnover in the first half of the year and in the second half, dropped back to    \npre-pandemic record lows, resulting in a 13% annualized turnover rate\u2014a strong    \nresult for a company of our size and scale. With our variety of resources and     \nprograms that support career growth and development, we\u2019re helping teammates have \nlong-term careers with our company. We also continue to enhance our internal      \nmobility practices, which has led to nearly 45% of our open roles being filled by \ninternal candidates. 2022 Employee Engagement Survey and turnover results         \nRecognitions In 2022, we were named World\u2019s Best Bank by Euromoney, America\u2019s Most\nJUST Company by JUST Capital and CNBC, and one of the 100 Best Companies to Work  \nFor by Fortune.

Our policy covers  \nany transactions where the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to   \nexceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our company is a participant, and a related   \nperson has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under our related \nperson transactions policy, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability     \nCommittee must approve or ratify any related person transactions, and when doing  \nso, consider: the related person\u2019s interest in the transaction; whether the       \ntransaction involves arm\u2019s-lengthbids or market prices and terms; the             \ntransaction\u2019s materiality to each party; the availability of the product or       \nservices through other sources; the implications of our Code of Conduct or        \nreputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a director\u2019s or executive \nofficer\u2019s judgment to act in our company\u2019s best interest; the transaction\u2019s       \nacceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an independent director,      \nwhether the transaction would impair his or her independence or status as an      \n\u201coutside\u201d or \u201cnon-employee\u201ddirector. Our Board has determined that certain types  \nof transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest on\nthe part of the related person and therefore do not require review or approval    \nunder the policy. These include transactions involving financial services,        \nincluding: loans and brokerage; banking, insurance, investment advisory, or asset \nmanagement services; and other financial services we provide to any related       \nperson, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of business, on       \nsubstantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable       \nservices provided to non-affiliates,and comply with applicable law, including the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. A number of our\ndirectors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family members, and   \ncertain business organizations associated with them are or have been clients of   \nour banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons have been made\nin the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including     \ninterest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in comparable      \ntransactions with persons not related to our company and did not involve more than\nthe normal risk of collectability. Occasionally, we may have employees who are    \nrelated to our executive officers, directors, or director nominees. The son of Mr.\nD. Steve Boland, an executive officer, and the brother of Dr. Zuber, a director   \nand nominee, are each employed by the company in non-executive, non-strategic     \npositions, and each received compensation in 2022 of approximately $145,000 and   \n$420,000, respectively. Dr. Zuber\u2019s brother\u2019s compensation is primarily           \ncommissions based. The methodology through which his compensation is calculated is\nconsistent with that used for other financial advisors in similar roles. The      \ncompensation and other terms of employment of both Mr. Boland\u2019s son and Dr.       \nZuber\u2019s brother are determined on a basis consistent with the company\u2019s human     \nresources policies. Our company and Mr. Moynihan are parties to an aircraft time- \nsharing agreement, as disclosed in prior proxy statements and approved by our     \nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee in December 2010. In      \naddition, the company and each of our executive officers have entered into        \nnonexclusive aircraft time-sharing agreements. These agreements provide a means   \nunder Federal Aviation Administration regulations for our executive officers to   \nreimburse the company for incremental costs of permitted personal travel on our   \ncompany\u2019s aircraft. To the extent such aircraft usage exceeds the dollar threshold\nin our related person transactions policy, it will be reviewed for approval or    \nratification by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee. Based\non information contained in separate Schedule 13G filings with the SEC, each of   \nWarren E. Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway), BlackRock, Inc.   \n(BlackRock), and The Vanguard Group (Vanguard) reported that it beneficially owned\nmore than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2022\n(see \u201cStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial    \nowners\u201d on the next page). In the ordinary course of our business during 2022, our\nsubsidiaries provided and are expected to continue to provide financial advisory, \nsales and trading, treasury, and other financial or administrative services to    \nBerkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, and Vanguard and their subsidiaries. These and     \nother routine business transactions between the companies were entered into on an \narm\u2019s-lengthbasis and contain customary terms and conditions. Our company and its \nsubsidiaries may also, in the ordinary course, invest in BlackRock or Vanguard    \nfunds or other products or buy or sell assets to or from BlackRock or Vanguard    \nfunds and separate accounts.                                                      \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    47  \n                              \nStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners   \nStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners   \nThe following table shows the number of shares of our common stock beneficially   \nowned as of March 1, 2023 by: (i) each director; (ii) each named executive        \nofficer; (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group; and (iv)          \nbeneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities (as       \ndetermined under SEC rules). As of that date, none of our directors and executive \nofficers owned any shares of any class of our voting securities or other preferred\nstock, other than as reported in the table below, or had any outstanding options  \nor warrants for such shares. Each director, each named executive officer, and all \ndirectors and current executive officers as a group beneficially owned less than  \n1% of our outstanding common stock or other preferred stock.

The number of restricted shares awarded is equal \nto the dollar value of the award divided by the closing price of our common stock \non the NYSE on the grant date, rounded down to the next whole share, with cash    \npaid for any fractional share. Dividends are paid on the award when they are paid \non shares of our common stock. The annual restricted stock award is subject to a  \none-yearvesting requirement. If a director retires before the one-yearvesting     \ndate, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the        \ndirector served during the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested amount  \nof the award is forfeited. 2022 Director compensation review Our Compensation and \nHuman Capital Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates to   \nthe director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee\u2019s      \nrecommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in\nmarket practices, and consultation with the Committee\u2019s independent compensation  \nconsultant, Farient Advisors. In 2022, the Committee reviewed director            \ncompensation, taking into account multiple factors, including pay practices at    \npublicly traded companies, continued expansion of non-managementdirector and Lead \nIndependent Director responsibilities, and growing time commitments. Based on that\nreview and the Committee\u2019s recommendation, our Board approved: for all non-       \nmanagementdirectors, a $20,000 annual cash award increase to $120,000 and a       \n$20,000 annual restricted stock award increase to $270,000; for our Lead          \nIndependent Director, a $25,000 incremental annual cash award increase to $75,000 \nand a $25,000 incremental annual restricted stock award increase to $125,000.     \nThese changes will take effect as of our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders and  \nwill be payable to our non-managementdirector nominees who are successfully       \nelected at that meeting. No changes were made to incremental annual cash awards   \nfor committee chair service. Director deferral plan Non-managementdirectors may   \nelect to defer all or a portion of their annual restricted stock or cash awards   \nthrough the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (Director Deferral \nPlan). When directors elect to defer their restricted stock award, their \u201cstock   \naccount\u201d is credited with \u201cstock units\u201d equal in value to the restricted stock    \naward and subject to the same vesting requirement applicable to restricted stock  \nawards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a share of our common   \nstock but because it is not an actual share of our common stock, it does not have \nany voting rights. When directors elect to defer their cash award, they may choose\nto defer into either a stock account or a \u201ccash account.\u201d Deferrals into a stock  \naccount are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional stock    \nunits and deferrals into the cash account are credited with interest at a long-   \nterm bond rate. Following retirement from our Board and depending on the          \ndirector\u2019s selection, a non-managementdirector may receive the stock account      \nbalance (to the extent vested) and cash account balance in a single lump-sumcash  \npayment or in a series of cash installment payments.                              \n                         \n  50    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nDirector compensation Stock retention requirements and hedging prohibition for    \ndirectors                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       Under our stock retention requirements, non-management directors are       \n       required to hold and cannot sell the restricted stock they receive as      \n  \u2022    compensation (except as necessary to pay taxes on taxable events such as   \n       vesting) until termination of their service.

At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, a    \nmajority of shareholders voted to have a \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote each year. As a result,\nwe have conducted an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named       \nexecutive officers annually. In Proposal 3, we ask our shareholders to recommend  \non an advisory basis how frequently we should provide future advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d\nvotes. Although the \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board,\nour Compensation and Human Capital Committee will take into consideration the     \noutcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. At the   \n2022 annual meeting of shareholders, 94.5% of the votes cast favored our \u201cSay on  \nPay\u201d proposal. The Committee considered this result and input from investors      \nduring our shareholder engagement process, and in light of the strong support,    \nmaintained a consistent overall approach for compensating named executive officers\nfor 2022 full year performance. Our Board has designed our current executive      \ncompensation program to appropriately link compensation realized by our executive \nofficers to our performance and properly align the interests of our executive     \nofficers with those of our shareholders. The details of this compensation for     \n2022, and the reasons we awarded it, are described in \u201cCompensation discussion and\nanalysis,\u201d starting below.                                                        \n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d approving our   \n  executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding  \n  \u201cSay on Pay\u201d resolution) (Proposal 2).            \n                                                    \nOur Board recommends that our shareholders vote in favor of the following         \nresolution: \u201cResolved, that our shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the   \ncompensation of our company\u2019s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to  \nthe compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \nincluding the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and  \nthe accompanying narrative discussion disclosed in this proxy statement.\u201d         \nCompensation discussion and analysis                                              \n                                                            \n  1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Executive summary                               54  \n  a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Executive compensation philosophy               54  \n  b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02022 Executive compensation highlights          54  \n  c.

Executive summary a. Executive            \ncompensation philosophy Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over\nthe long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance considerations      \ninclude both financial and non-financialmeasures\u2014including the manner in which    \nresults are achieved\u2014for the company, line of business, and the individual. The   \n\u201cPay evaluation and decision process\u201d section on page 55 presents the range of    \nperformance and governance considerations that the Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee considers as inputs into compensation decisions. These factors are      \nevaluated each year and have remained generally consistent over time as part of a \nbalanced and disciplined approach to the compensation decision process. Within    \nthat broader framework, the \u201cCompany performance\u201d and \u201cSegment performance\u201d       \nsections on pages 56 and 57 highlight key company and segment performance         \nconsiderations for 2022, and the \u201cIndividual performance highlights\u201d section      \nbeginning on page 58 focuses on performance for each of our named executive       \nofficers. These considerations reinforce and promote Responsible Growth and       \nmaintain alignment with our Risk Framework. Our executive compensation program    \nprovides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align        \nexecutive officer and shareholder interests. Our Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee has the primary responsibility for approving our compensation strategy  \nand philosophy, and the compensation programs applicable to our named executive   \nofficers listed below. With respect to Mr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation, our           \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee makes a recommendation that is further   \nreviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board.

Shareholder engagement & \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results We conduct shareholder engagement\nthroughout the year and provide shareholders with an annual opportunity to cast an\nadvisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote. At our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, out of    \napproximately 8.1 billion shares outstanding and entitled to vote, over 94% of the\napproximately 5.7 billion votes cast favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. This      \nrepresents the 12th consecutive year of \u201cSay on Pay\u201d approval of 92% or higher.   \nAdditionally, in 2022 and early 2023, management and directors met with investors \nowning approximately 52% of our outstanding institutional shares and, at the      \nmajority of these meetings, discussed our executive compensation program, human   \ncapital management, and other compensation-related matters. These discussions,    \ntogether with the 2022 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results, indicated strong support for our 2021\ncompensation program and influenced our decision to maintain a consistent overall \napproach for 2022.                                                                \n                         \n  54    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCompensation discussion and analysis 2. Pay evaluation and decision process Each  \nyear, our Compensation and Human Capital Committee reviews our named executive    \nofficers\u2019 performance using a balanced and disciplined approach to determine their\nbase salaries and variable compensation awards. The approach for 2022 included a  \nrange of performance and governance considerations as inputs into compensation    \ndecisions, which remain largely unchanged from prior years. The Committee\u2019s       \ncompensation decision process involves a robust review of company and line of     \nbusiness performance as well as individual performance for each named executive   \nofficer. Our performance framework for named executive officers is aligned to the \nfour tenets of Responsible Growth. At the start of each year, goals aligned to the\ntenets of Responsible Growth are set for each executive officer and progress to   \nmeeting those goals are tracked on scorecards, including both financial and non-  \nfinancialresults. The Committee also takes into account the manner in which       \nresults are achieved and creating accountability to building trust in our         \ncommunities, application of our core values and performance relative to peers.    \nBelow are examples of the key metrics tracked across company, line of business and\nindividual performance, as appropriate by role.

SEC rules require that the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d include equity   \ncompensation in the year granted, while the Committee awards equity compensation  \nafter the performance year. Therefore, equity-based incentives granted in 2022 for\nthe 2021 performance year are shown in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d as 2022   \ncompensation. The equity-based incentives above were granted in 2023 for the 2022 \nperformance year. The \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d also includes elements of      \ncompensation not shown above.

Executive compensation program features a.\nExecutive pay components & variable pay mix Our Compensation and Human Capital    \nCommittee determines the pay for our named executive officers for each performance\nyear. Our pay-for-performancestructure is designed to emphasize variable pay and  \nhelp motivate our executives to deliver sustained shareholder value and           \nResponsible Growth. Restricted stock units are divided into the following         \ncomponents: cash-settled (CEO only), time-based and performance-based. The CEO\u2019s  \ncash- settled restricted stock units continue to vest over one year. Time-based   \nrestricted stock units vest ratably over four years, to further drive long- term  \nshareholder alignment. Our performance-based awards continue to use a re-         \nearnapproach, meaning 100% of the award is the maximum that can be earned, and    \nvest only if performance standards are met over a three-year period.

Standards for performance restricted stock\nunits Re-earningthe PRSUs granted in February 2023 (based on 2022 performance)    \nrequires the company to meet average ROA and average adjusted TBV growth standards\n(tax-normalized)over a three-year performance period from 2023-2025. The Committee\nmade no change to the standards for performance year 2022 PRSU awards. Under a    \nhypothetical scenario, if our 2022 ending assets of $3.1 trillion remained        \nconstant during the performance period, our company would need to earn $73.2      \nbillion in aggregate net income from 2023-2025 to achieve the PRSU 80 bps ROA     \nstandard. On an annualized basis, this equals approximately $24.4 billion in      \nearnings which is higher than reported net income in eight of the last twelve     \nyears. These performance metrics and standards encourage the achievement of       \nsustained shareholder value and Responsible Growth. PRSUs are forfeited if results\nare below both minimum standards. PRSUs granted since 2017 provide no upside      \npayout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be re-earnedfor these awards).   \nFor any portion of the PRSU standards achieved, payment will be made after the end\nof the performance period.

Effective January 2023, the SEC adopted final rules directing the \nNYSE to establish listing standards requiring clawback of certain incentive       \ncompensation if an accounting restatement is required. We are in the process of   \nevaluating these new rules and identifying any necessary updates to our Incentive \nCompensation Recoupment Policy. Pursuant to our Incentive Compensation Forfeiture \n& Recoupment Disclosure Policy, we will disclose publicly the incentive           \nforfeitures or clawbacks recovered from certain senior executives in the aggregate\npursuant to our Detrimental Conduct and Incentive Compensation Recoupment policies\ndescribed above, subject to certain privacy, privilege, and regulatory            \nlimitations. iii. Stock ownership & retention requirements Our stock ownership and\nretention requirements align executive officer and shareholder interests by       \nlinking the value realized from equity-based awards to sustainable company        \nperformance.

Full-value shares and units owned, awarded, \nor deemed beneficially owned are included in the stock ownership calculations;    \nPRSUs are included only when earned and stock options are not included. Our Code  \nof Conduct prohibits our executive officers from hedging and speculative trading  \nof company securities. See the \u201cHedging policy\u201d section on page 34 for more       \ninformation on our hedging policy and rules.                                      \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    65  \n                              \nCompensation discussion and analysis 6. Other compensation topics a. Results for  \nperformance restricted stock units PRSUs have been a component of our executive   \ncompensation program since 2011. PRSUs require recipients to re-earnawards over   \nthe performance period based on achievement of established performance standards  \nand help align management with shareholder interests. Since 2013, PRSUs have been \nbased 50% on three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year average growth in       \nadjusted TBV standards. Our practice is not to make discretionary adjustments to  \nPRSU results for the impact of legacy litigation, fines, and penalties, the Tax   \nCuts and Jobs Act, or impairment charges, which has contributed to outcomes for   \nPRSU payouts since their introduction. The 2020 PRSUs completed in 2022 were re-  \nearned at 89% of the target opportunity based on ROA results of 87 bps and        \nadjusted TBV results of 10.44% (compared to 100% target opportunity based on 2020 \nPRSU performance standards set at ROA results of \u2265100 bps and TBV results of      \n\u22658.5%) (1). We did not make adjustments to those awards in response to the        \nCOVID-19pandemic and related effects. See the description of the 2020 PRSUs and   \nvesting terms following the \u201cGrants of plan-based awards table\u201d on page 65 of our \n2021 proxy statement. The maximum payout opportunity is 100% for all outstanding  \nawards. The award terms for these PRSUs provide for the calculation of performance\nresults at the conclusion of each calendar year in the performance period. As a   \nresult, the performance results above may differ from the results reported under  \nGAAP in our company\u2019s audited financial statements.                               \n                                                                                  \n  (1)  The three-year average ROA and three-year average growth in adjusted TBV   \n       results were calculated as follows:                                        \n                                                                                  \nThree-year Average ROAwas the average \u201creturn on assets\u201d for the three calendar   \nyears in the performance period. For this purpose, \u201creturn on assets\u201d was based on\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at the conclusion of each year.   \nThree-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBVwas the average year-over-year percentage\nchange in \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for the three calendar years in the      \nperformance period. For this purpose, \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for each year\nequaled our total common shareholders\u2019 equity, less (a) the impact of any capital \nactions approved (or not objected to) by the Federal Reserve Board and/or approved\nby our company\u2019s Board, and less (b) the sum of the carrying value of: (i)        \ngoodwill and (ii) intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted \nfor (iii) deferred tax liabilities directly related to: (i) and (ii). Each year-  \nover-year percentage change was measured after the conclusion of each calendar    \nyear using the beginning balance as of January 1 and the ending balance as of     \nDecember 31 of that year. b.

For 2022, these companies were: Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, Chevron, \nCisco, Coca-Cola, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, IBM, Intel,      \nJohnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Philip Morris International, Procter & Gamble,\nVerizon, and Wal-Mart.                                                            \n                         \n  66    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCompensation discussion and analysis c. Retirement benefits We provide our named  \nexecutive officers the opportunity to save for their retirement via employee and  \nemployer contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on\nthe same terms as other U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract\nand retain key people by providing a means to save for retirement. Certain named  \nexecutive officers also participate in various frozen qualified and nonqualified  \ndefined benefit pension plans. For more information about these plans, see        \n\u201cPension benefits table\u201d and \u201cNonqualified deferred compensation table\u201d on pages  \n74 and 75, respectively. d. Health and welfare benefits & perquisites Our named   \nexecutive officers receive health and welfare benefits, such as medical, life, and\nlong-term disability coverage, under plans generally available to all other       \nU.S.-based salaried employees; in addition, our named executive officers are      \neligible to receive an annual physical exam. Because we have internal expertise on\nfinancial advisory matters, we do not charge fees to our named executive officers \nfor their use of our financial advisory services for personal needs. We also may  \nprovide certain named executive officers with secured parking. For information    \nsecurity purposes and efficiency, certain named executive officers are permitted  \nto use a car service when commuting to and from our offices or business- related  \nevents; participating named executive officers reimburse the company for          \nincremental costs incurred. In limited circumstances, we may occasionally provide \nmeals and allow spouses or guests to accompany executives traveling for a         \nbusiness-related purpose and pay for other incidental expenses. Our policy        \nprovides for the use of corporate aircraft by senior management for approved      \ntravel. For reasons of security, personal safety, and efficiency, we require our  \nCEO to use corporate aircraft for all air travel (business, commuting, and        \npersonal). Pursuant to his aircraft time-sharing agreement, our CEO reimburses our\ncompany for costs related to his use of our aircraft for commuting. Our executive \nofficers, including our named executive officers, other than our CEO, are         \npermitted to use corporate aircraft for limited personal travel with reimbursement\nto the company for incremental costs, pursuant to their aircraft time-sharing     \nagreements. e. Tax deductibility of compensation U.S. tax law limits a public     \ncompany\u2019s deductions to $1 million per year for compensation paid to its CEO,     \nchief financial officer, and each of its three other most highly compensated      \nexecutive officers, as well as to any individual who was subject to the $1 million\ndeduction limitation in 2017 or any later year. The Committee continues to retain \nthe discretion to make awards and pay amounts that do not qualify as deductible.  \n                                                  \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 2).                     \n                                                  \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee Report Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion  \nand Analysis that immediately precedes this report.

Typically, we grant stock awards early in the year as     \n       part of total year-end compensation awarded for prior year performance.    \n       As a result, the amounts for stock awards generally appear in the          \n       \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d for the year after the performance year upon  \n       which they were based, and therefore the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d      \n  (1)  does not fully reflect our Compensation and Human Capital Committee\u2019s      \n       view of its pay-for-performance executive compensation program for a       \n       particular performance year. For example, amounts shown as 2022            \n       compensation in the \u201cStock awards\u201d column include stock awards granted in  \n       February 2022 for 2021 performance, as well as other stock awards granted  \n       during 2022 that are not part of performance year 2022 compensation. See   \n       \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d on page 53 for a discussion about   \n       how the Committee viewed its 2022 compensation decisions for the named     \n       executive officers.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (2)  All listed named executive officer positions are those held as of          \n       December 31, 2022.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Includes any amounts voluntarily deferred under our qualified 401(k) plan  \n  (3)  and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

Grants of stock-based awards      \n       (excluding CRSUs) include the right to receive cash dividends only if and  \n       when the underlying award becomes vested and payable. The grant date fair  \n       value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the applicable  \n       grant date ($47.79 on February\u00a015, 2022). For the PRSUs granted in 2022,   \n       the actual number of PRSUs earned (0% up to the maximum level of 100%)     \n       will depend on our company\u2019s future achievement of specific ROA and        \n       growth in adjusted TBV standards (tax-normalized) over a three-year        \n       performance period ending December\u00a031, 2024. Values in the \u201cStock awards\u201d  \n       column assume that 100% (the maximum level) of the PRSUs granted would     \n       vest as the probable outcome for purposes of determining the grant date    \n  (5)  fair value. The grant date fair value for PRSUs and TRSUs granted in 2022  \n       includes a discount rate of approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, to    \n       reflect the impact of post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of   \n       these awards. The grant date fair value for the PRSUs and TRSUs granted    \n       in 2021 includes a discount of approximately 14% and 15%, respectively,    \n       and the grant date fair value for the PRSUs and TRSUs granted in 2020      \n       includes a discount of approximately 10% to reflect the impact of          \n       post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of these awards. No        \n       discount was applied to awards of CRSUs, or to the TRSUs granted to        \n       Messrs. Borthwick, Athanasia, Donofrio and Greener described in footnote   \n       3 to the \u201cGrants of plan-based awards table\u201d on page 70.

In late 2017, we amended our policy to require Mr.    \nMoynihan to use only corporate aircraft for all business, commuting, and personal \nflights. We generally do not consider amounts related to business- and/or         \nbusiness-development related flights as compensation to Mr. Moynihan, and we      \nconsider the amounts related to Mr. Moynihan\u2019s required personal and commuting use\nof our corporate aircraft to be necessary business expenses for reasons of        \nsecurity, personal safety, and efficiency. However, SEC rules require that we     \ninclude in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d the value of certain flights or       \nportions of certain flights as a perquisite. Therefore, the amount shown for Mr.  \nMoynihan for use of corporate aircraft primarily reflects the aggregate           \nincremental cost to our company for: (i) elements of business- and/or business-   \ndevelopment related flights and (ii) all personal flights taken for non-commuting,\nnon-businesspurposes. Under his aircraft time-sharing agreement, during 2022 Mr.  \nMoynihan reimbursed our company for certain incremental costs of flights on our   \ncorporate aircraft for commuting purposes. Mr. Moynihan is responsible for his own\ntaxes on any imputed income resulting from his personal use of our corporate      \naircraft.

The grant date fair value of     \n       the PRSUs and the TRSUs granted in 2022 (excluding the TRSUs granted to    \n       Messrs. Borthwick, Athanasia, Donofrio and Greener described in footnote   \n       3 below) includes a discount of approximately 12% and 13%, respectively,   \n       to reflect the impact of post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value   \n       of these awards.

For this   \n       purpose, \u201creturn on assets\u201d will be determined at the conclusion of each   \n  \u2022    year based on the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)          \n       definition and, to the extent necessary, normalized to exclude the         \n       material effects of changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and       \n       related regulations adopted after the first day of the performance         \n       period.                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       \u201cThree-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV\u201d means the average              \n       year-over-year percentage change in \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for     \n       the three calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose,      \n       \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for each year will equal our total common   \n       shareholders\u2019 equity, less (a) the impact of any capital actions approved  \n       by our company\u2019s Board and completed by Bank of America, and less (b)\u00a0the  \n       sum of the carrying value of: (i)\u00a0goodwill and (ii)\u00a0intangible assets      \n  \u2022    excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted for (iii)\u00a0deferred tax       \n       liabilities directly related to (i)\u00a0and (ii). Each year-over-year          \n       percentage change is measured after the conclusion of each calendar year   \n       using the beginning balance as of January 1 and the ending balance as of   \n       December 31 of that year and, to the extent necessary, will be normalized  \n       to exclude the material effects of changes in the Internal Revenue Code    \n       of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day of the         \n       performance period.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The awards are equally weighted with 50% based on ROA standards            \n       (tax-normalized) and 50% based on adjusted TBV growth standards. The       \n       portion of the PRSUs earned for the performance period depends on the      \n  \u2022    level of our average ROA and adjusted TBV growth. No PRSUs will be earned  \n       if results are below the minimum standards.

Deferred    \ncompensation plan. Each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate\nin the Bank of America Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan),   \nwhich is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allows for deferrals above   \nthe IRS limits on qualified plans. Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of   \nbase salary and up to 75% of certain eligible incentive awards. Employer          \ncontributions made under the plan, if any, when combined with the employer        \ncontributions under the 401(k) plan, will not exceed the maximum employer         \ncontributions allowable under the 401(k) Plan\u2014$12,500 for matching contributions  \nand $7,500 for annual company contributions. Participants may generally elect to  \nreceive their distribution in a lump-sumpayment or installments payable up to 15  \nyears. Participants are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that    \nthey deferred or any notional investment earnings (based on elections of the same \ninvestment options as under the 401(k) Plan) until those amounts are distributed  \nto them, and we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until they are       \ndistributed. Legacy deferred compensation plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia    \neach have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive        \nDeferred Compensation Plan No. 2 (Legacy Deferred Compensation Plan), which is a  \nnonqualified retirement savings plan. Prior to being closed to deferrals in 2002, \nparticipants could defer base salary and certain bonuses under the plan.          \nParticipants can elect payments in a lump-sumor up to 15 annual installments      \neither on or after termination of employment, but not beyond the year in which the\nparticipant turns 65. Legacy supplemental plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia    \neach have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive        \nSupplemental Plan (Legacy Supplemental Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement  \nsavings plan that allowed deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. This \nplan was closed to contributions in 2004. Payments are made in a lump-sumor up to \n15 annual installments beginning in the year of termination of employment or any  \nlater year elected by the participant, but not beyond the year in which the       \nparticipant turns 65. Legacy ESA plan. Mr. Athanasia has a nonqualified deferred  \ncompensation account that was established prior to FleetBoston\u2019s merger with Bank \nof America Corporation and funded by employer contributions (Legacy ESA Plan).    \nThis plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Upon his termination of employment,\nMr. Athanasia will be paid in equal installments over a one-yearrestrictive       \ncovenant period, unless he terminates due to death or disability. Potential       \npayments upon termination or change in control We do not have any agreements with \nour named executive officers that provide for cash severance payments upon        \ntermination of employment or a change in control. In addition, since 2002, we have\nmaintained the Bank of America Corporation Corporate Policy Regarding Seeking     \nStockholder Approval of Future Severance Agreements (the Severance Agreement      \nApproval Policy). Under our Severance Agreement Approval Policy, we will not enter\ninto employment or severance agreements with our executive officers that provide  \nseverance benefits exceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined under the\nSeverance Agreement Approval Policy), unless the agreement has been approved by   \nour shareholders. See also Proposal 7. Potential payments from equity-based awards\nOur equity-based awards to our named executive officers include standard          \nprovisions that cause awards to vest or be forfeited upon termination of          \nemployment, depending on the reason for termination. These provisions for awards  \ngranted in 2022 are described in more detail on page 70, and those details can be \nfound for awards granted in prior years in our prior proxy statements. In general,\nour awards provide for continued payments on the original schedule after certain  \ntypes of termination of employment, subject to the following conditions, as       \napplicable in individual award agreements:                                        \n                                                                                  \n       In case of a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d, the award continues to be paid      \n       according to the award\u2019s payment schedule if the executive complies with   \n       certain covenants, including not working for a competitive business. A     \n       Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or involuntary termination      \n       (other than for death, disability, or cause) after the executive has met   \n       certain specified age and/or service requirements. For awards granted      \n       before February\u00a015, 2022, the named executive officers must have at least  \n       10 years of service and his or her age and years of service must add up    \n  \u2022    to at                                                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  76    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nExecutive compensation                                                            \n                                                                                  \n  least 60 (sometimes referred to in prior years as \u201cRule of 60\u201d). For awards     \n  granted on or after February\u00a015, 2022, the named executive officers must have   \n  at least 10 years of service and reached at least age 50. Currently, each of    \n  the named executive officers meets the applicable requirements for a            \n  Qualifying Termination.                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Awards remain subject to performance-based cancellation prior to payment   \n       and may be cancelled in whole or in part if losses occur. Awards also can  \n       be cancelled or recouped if the executive engages in detrimental conduct.  \n       Further, under our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, the Board     \n       can require reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid to an         \n  \u2022    executive officer whose fraud or intentional misconduct causes our         \n       company to restate its financial statements. We are also in the process    \n       of evaluating the SEC\u2019s new final rules implementing Section\u00a0954 of the    \n       Dodd-Frank Act (requiring clawback of certain incentive compensation if    \n       an accounting restatement is required) and identifying any necessary       \n       updates to our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy.                   \n                                                                                  \nAwards to our named executive officers under the BACEP are generally designed to  \nbe paid per schedule if an executive\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or\nfor \u201cgood reason\u201d within two years after a change in control. This change in      \ncontrol treatment is often referred to as \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting, because it    \nrequires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary          \ntermination (either by our company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood  \nreason\u201d). The BACEP does not provide our executive officers \u201csingle trigger\u201d      \nvesting upon a change in control. If a named executive officer is terminated for  \n\u201ccause,\u201d our equity-based awards provide that the awards will be forfeited. The   \nfollowing table shows the value of equity awards that would have been payable,    \nsubject to the non-competeor compliance with covenants, as applicable, for a      \ntermination of employment as of December 31, 2022. For this purpose, restricted   \nstock units were valued at our closing price as of December 30, 2022, which was   \n$33.12 per share. Due to a number of factors that affect the nature and amount of \nany benefits provided upon termination of employment, any actual amounts paid or  \ndistributed may vary from the amounts listed below. Factors that could affect     \nthese amounts include the time during the year of any such event, any accrued but \nunpaid cash dividend equivalents and related interest, and the price of our common\nstock.

In   \n  (3)  the event of such a termination, the value of the equity-based awards      \n       payable to Mr.\u00a0Borthwick as of December 31, 2022, would have been          \n       $18,616,829, subject to conditions for payment including compliance with   \n       covenants regarding non-solicitation, detrimental conduct, and compliance  \n       with anti-hedging/derivative transaction policies.                         \n                                                                                  \nOther potential payments Following termination of employment, our named executive \nofficers receive payment of retirement benefits and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation benefits under our various plans in which they participate. The value\nof those benefits as of December 31, 2022 is set forth in the sections above      \nentitled \u201cPension benefits table\u201d and \u201cNonqualified deferred compensation table.\u201d \nThere are no special or enhanced benefits under those plans for our named         \nexecutive officers, and all of our named executive officers are fully vested in   \nthe benefits discussed in those sections.                                         \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    77  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Executive compensationWe make tax and financial planning advisory services      \n  available to our named executive officers during their employment with us. The  \n  standard form of this benefit continues through the end of the year in which    \n  the executive ceases employment, including preparation of that year\u2019s tax       \n  returns. This benefit may continue for an extended term of up to five years if  \n  the executive meets the age and service standard for a Qualifying Termination   \n  and does not engage in any full-time employment. The benefit offered during     \n  the extended term will end during the calendar year any other full-time         \n  employment begins; the benefit, however, will end immediately following         \n  termination for cause, or if the executive engages in detrimental conduct or    \n  begins employment with a named competitor.Bank of America employees who retire  \n  and meet the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination have access   \n  to continued coverage under our group health plan, but the employee generally   \n  must pay for the full cost of that coverage on anafter-taxbasis without any     \n  employer subsidy.An employee who is a former NationsBank employee and who was   \n  hired before January 1, 2000 is eligible for an annual supplement to help       \n  cover the cost of retiree medical benefits if they meet the \u201cRule of 75\u201d at     \n  termination. The amount of this supplement equals $30 per year of service. An   \n  employee meets the Rule of 75 if they retire after age 50, with at least 15     \n  years of vesting service under our pension plan, and with a combined age and    \n  years of service of 75 or more. As of the end of the last fiscal year, the      \n  only named executive officer eligible for these benefits was Mr.\u00a0Donofrio. The  \n  amount of the annual retiree medical benefit supplement for Mr.\u00a0Donofrio based  \n  on his years of service through December 31, 2022 is $660. If Mr.\u00a0Donofrio      \n  predeceases his spouse, this supplement will continue at a rate of 50% for the  \n  life of his surviving spouse.Also, all eligible employees hired before January  \n  1, 2006 who meet the Rule of 75 when they terminate receive $5,000 of retiree   \n  life insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2022, Mr.\u00a0Donofrio was the only     \n  named executive officer who would have qualified for this benefit.78BANK OF     \n  AMERICA                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nCEO pay ratio CEO pay ratio Below is: (i) the 2022 annual total compensation of   \nour CEO; (ii) the 2022 annual total compensation of our median employee; (iii) the\nratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee; \nand (iv) the methodology we used to calculate our CEO pay ratio:                  \n                                                              \n  CEO pay ratio                                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CEO annual total compensation*               $  30,187,252  \n  Median employee annual total compensation    $     117,040  \n  CEO to median employee pay ratio                     258:1  \n                                                              \n                                                                                  \n  *  This annual total compensation is the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d amount,   \n     plus certain nondiscriminatory benefits (including health insurance).        \n                                                                                  \nMethodology Our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner     \nconsistent with SEC rules.

We then           \n       calculated our CEO\u2019s annual total compensation using the same approach to  \n       determine the pay ratio shown above.                                       \n                                                                                  \nWe invest in our employees at all levels in the company by rewarding performance  \nthat balances risk and reward, empowering professional growth and development, and\nby offering affordable benefits and programs that meet the diverse needs of our   \nemployees and their families.

Our pay-for-performance approach bases            \ncompensation on actual results and how those results were achieved. We align      \nexecutive and shareholder interests through a compensation program providing a mix\nof salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time, including deferred equity-    \nbased awards. Review our \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d on page [*] for   \nmore information on executive compensation considerations and decisions for our   \nnamed executive officers. Page [*] of the \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d  \nincludes 2022 compensation decisions for our named executive officers; these      \ndecisions are different than the table below which are calculated under prescribed\nSEC rules.

The importance of return on assets (ROA) and tangible book    \nvalue (TBV) is reflected in our use of these measures when setting performance    \nstandards applicable to our PRSUs. As described in our \u201cCompensation discussion   \nand analysis\u201d on page [*], the Compensation and Human Capital Committee and, with \nrespect to our CEO, the independent directors of our full Board bases the         \nexecutive compensation decisions on an evaluation of each executive\u2019s annual      \nperformance. Because performance evaluations occur after the close of each        \nperformance year, compensation decisions made at the beginning of the fiscal year \nare generally based on the prior fiscal year\u2019s performance. Our Compensation and  \nHuman Capital Committee believes in linking executive pay to company performance  \nand, accordingly, the majority of variable pay awarded to our executive officers  \nis made up of equity-based awards that track the value of our company stock price \nover time. As required by SEC rules, the performance measures identified as the   \nmost important ones used by the company to link named executive officers\u2019 2022    \ncompensation actually paid to performance are listed below.                       \n                                                                                  \n  Performance Measures    Other Considerations                                    \n                          In addition to the performance measures listed here,    \n                          the Committee considers a range of factors in           \n                          determining compensation aligned with the tenets of     \n                          Responsible Growth based on (i) growing and winning in  \n                          the market; (ii) growing with our customer-focused      \n                          strategy; (iii) growing within our Risk Framework, and  \n                          (iv) growing in a sustainable manner.                   \n                          For additional information regarding our named          \n                          executive officers\u2019 2022 performance and the role the   \n                          performance measures play in our compensation program,  \n                          see \u201cIndividual performance highlights\u201d beginning on    \n                          page [*] and \u201cPay evaluation and decision process\u201d on   \n                          page [*].                                               \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    81  \n                              \nProposal 3: A vote on the frequency of future \u201csay on pay\u201d resolutions (an        \nadvisory, non-binding\u201csay on frequency\u201d resolution) Proposal 3: A vote on the     \nfrequency of future \u201cSay on Pay\u201d resolutions (an advisory, non-binding\u201cSay on     \nFrequency\u201d resolution)                                                            \n                                                   \n  Our Board recommends that shareholders vote to   \n  have future advisory votes to approve executive  \n  compensation \u201cEACH YEAR\u201d (Proposal 3).           \n                                                   \nSection 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) provides our    \nshareholders with the opportunity to recommend, on an advisory basis, how         \nfrequently we should conduct future advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d votes to approve the    \ncompensation of our named executive officers. By voting on this Proposal 3,       \nshareholders may tell us whether they would prefer to have an advisory \u201cSay on    \nPay\u201d vote each year, every two years, or every three years. Our Board believes    \nthat continuing to conduct an advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote annually is the most     \nappropriate policy for our company. This frequency will enable our shareholders to\nprovide timely feedback on our executive compensation program based on the most   \nrecent information presented in our proxy statement. An annual advisory vote to   \napprove the compensation of our named executive officers also is consistent with  \nour practice of having all directors elected annually and providing shareholders  \nthe opportunity to ratify the Audit Committee\u2019s selection of our independent      \nregistered public accounting firm annually. Shareholders can select one of four   \nchoices for this Proposal on the proxy card: each year; every two years; every    \nthree years; or abstain. Because this is an advisory vote, the voting results will\nnot be binding on our Board. However, our Board values shareholder opinion and    \nwill consider the frequency that receives the most votes when deciding how often  \nto have advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d votes in the future.                                \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote of \u201cEVERY  \n  YEAR\u201d on this proposal (Proposal 3).                \n                                                      \n                         \n  82    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 4: Ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public        \naccounting firm for 2023 Proposal 4: Ratifying the appointment of our independent \nregistered public accounting firm for 2023                                        \n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d ratifying the   \n  appointment of our independent registered public  \n  accounting firm for 2023 (Proposal 4).            \n                                                    \nOur Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation,    \nretention, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, and\nis involved in the selection of the firm\u2019s lead engagement partner who is subject \nto a mandatory, regular rotation and who may provide services to our company for a\nmaximum of five consecutive years. In selecting and approving a lead engagement   \npartner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by      \nmanagement and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates,           \nassessments of their professional experience, and input from our company\u2019s        \nindependent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an   \nannual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm. It        \nconsiders, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best        \ninterests of our company and its shareholders, taking into account the firm\u2019s     \nquality of service, the firm\u2019s institutional knowledge and experience, the firm\u2019s \ninternational capabilities, the firm\u2019s sufficiency of resources, the quality of   \nthe communication and interaction with the firm, and the firm\u2019s independence,     \nobjectivity, and professional skepticism. The Committee also considers the        \nadvisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered \npublic accounting firm. After assessing the qualifications, performance, and      \nindependence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which has served as our         \ncompany\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm since 1958, the Committee \nbelieves that retaining PwC is in the best interests of our company. The Committee\nhas appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit   \nthe 2023 consolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its \nsubsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking           \nshareholders to ratify PwC\u2019s appointment. If our shareholders do not ratify PwC\u2019s \nappointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered      \npublic accounting firm for 2024. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC\u2019s         \nappointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public  \naccounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate.   \nPwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with      \nrespect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of  \nthe SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Representatives of PwC \nare expected to be present at our annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make\na statement if they choose, and are expected to be available to respond to        \nappropriate shareholder questions.

Our\nBoard has determined that all Committee members are independent under the NYSE    \nlisting standards, our Categorical Standards, and applicable SEC rules and        \nregulations. Our Board has also determined that all Committee members are         \nfinancially literate in accordance with NYSE listing standards and qualify as     \n\u201caudit committee financial experts\u201d as defined by SEC rules.

Management \nis responsible for preparing and the overall reporting process with respect to our\ncompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and, with the assistance of our      \ncompany\u2019s internal corporate auditors, for establishing, maintaining, and         \nassessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.     \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our company\u2019s independent registered public     \naccounting firm, is responsible for planning and conducting an independent audit  \nof our company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the         \nstandards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)  \nand for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of these financial statements  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and \nas to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The    \nCommittee\u2019s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.

Based on our current grant practices, these shares would last less than\none year, while the current BACEP term has eight years remaining. We believe it is\nappropriate to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for    \nawards under the BACEP so that our company can continue the practice of granting  \ndeferred equity-based awards in lieu of cash. We estimate the total dilutive      \neffect of the BACEP and our legacy stock plans on our shareholders (sometimes     \ncalled \u201coverhang\u201d) resulting from the amendment and restatement would be          \napproximately 4.6%, with the incremental overhang resulting from the requested    \nshare increase equal to approximately 0.9%. The overhang is calculated as follows,\nin each case as of March 1, 2023:                                                 \n                                                                          \n  (a) Incremental share request subject to                 75,000,000     \n  shareholder approval                                                    \n  (b) Shares underlying outstanding awards of                             \n  restricted shares / stock-settled restricted stock      234,426,584     \n  units under all equity plans(1)                                         \n  (c) Options outstanding under all equity plans(2)                 0     \n  (d) Shares currently available for future issuance       78,478,349     \n  under all equity plans(3)                                               \n  (e) Total shares available for, or outstanding          387,904,933     \n  under, equity awards (a + b + c + d)                                    \n  (f) Total common shares outstanding                   7,999,284,317     \n  (g) Fully diluted overhang (e/(e+f))(4)                         4.6  %  \n  (h) Basic diluted overhang (e/f)                                4.8  %  \n                                                                          \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    85  \n                              \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n       Includes 5,903,902 vested restricted stock units subject to a required     \n       six- or twelve-month holding period and 9,747,076 vested restricted stock  \n       units that are expected to be issued/ delivered within 30 days of the      \n  (1)  record date.

Additionally, our rate at which\nwe grant equity awards relative to shares of our common stock outstanding         \n(sometimes referred to as \u201crun rate\u201d) was below the average run rate for our      \nprimary competitor group on a one-yearand three-year average basis. If the        \nproposed amendment and restatement is approved, we expect the pool of requested   \nshares to last approximately one year, assuming we maintain similar grant         \npractices as over the past two years and assuming hypothetically our current stock\nprice remains constant. The number of shares remaining available for grant under  \nthe BACEP as noted in the previous table differs from those reported as of        \nDecember 31, 2022 because that information does not take into account year-to-    \ndategrants during 2023 for the 2022 performance year. Information regarding the   \nnumber of shares remaining available for grant as required by SEC disclosure rules\nare discussed in detail in this proposal under \u201cAdditional information\u201d on page   \n92. The list of companies included in our primary competitor group are detailed   \nunder \u201cCompetitor groups\u201d on page 66. Purpose of the Plan The Plan, and the       \nproposed amendment and restatement of it, is intended to serve a critical role in \nour pay-for-performancecompensation program and is necessary for us to comply with\nthe regulatory landscape in certain jurisdictions. In addition, our Board believes\nthat equity-based awards aid in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our   \nemployees and are the most direct way to align employee interests with those of   \nshareholders. As part of our pay-for-performancepractices, more than 100,000      \nemployees receive variable incentives. More highly compensated employees receive a\nportion of their variable incentive as deferred restricted stock units (RSUs). The\nportion of the variable incentive deferred as equity-based awards generally       \nincreases with compensation levels according to a predetermined deferral grid.    \nRSUs are also a significant component of the Sharing Success stock awards that    \nwill be made to approximately 96% of employees in March 2023. Most Sharing Success\nawards are in the form of company common stock, providing the opportunity to      \nfurther share in our company\u2019s long-term success. The RSU awards are a key part of\nour pay-for-performancephilosophy, and in many cases are required by law, rule,   \nand regulation. In addition, our executive officers receive PRSUs that must be re-\nearnedby meeting specific performance criteria, as described on page 63 for awards\ngranted in February 2023. Equity awards granted to employees are subject to       \ncancellation and clawback features which encourage appropriate behavior and manage\nrisk in our compensation program; these features are described on page 65.        \nGranting RSU awards that include deferral, cancellation, and clawback features is \na key risk-balancing mechanism in our pay-for-performance compensation program,   \nand serves to align employee interests with shareholder interests while complying \nwith regulatory requirements. The value of RSUs tracks the price of our common    \nshares. Compensation expense is in the compensation and benefits expense line of  \nthe income statement. The Plan, and the proposed amendment and restatement of it, \nis intended to be the company\u2019s vehicle for delivering deferred equity-based      \nawards. Since additional shares to the Plan were last approved by shareholders in \n2021, the amount of common stock awarded has averaged approximately 106 million   \nshares each year, which includes approximately 23 million shares to be granted in \nMarch 2023 under the Sharing Success award program, leaving approximately 55      \nmillion shares remaining for awards. The Board has determined to increase the     \nshares of our common stock available for awards under the Plan by 75 million      \nshares to enable the granting of Plan awards in the future. The alternative would \nbe to increase the use of deferred cash awards, which we believe would be less    \naligned with shareholder interests. Therefore, the Board recommends the amendment \nand restatement to increase the number of shares of common stock available for    \nawards under the Plan. In addition, the company has and continues to repurchase   \nshares of common stock in an amount at least equal to the value of stock-settled  \nequity awards as they are recognized into capital. These share repurchases offset \nthe net new shares of common stock delivered under the BACEP. The company         \ncurrently intends to continue this repurchase practice. The company\u2019s common stock\nrepurchases are subject to required regulatory and Board approvals. The additional\n75 million shares to be authorized under the BACEP would allow our company to     \ncontinue current grant practices for approximately one year.                      \n                         \n  86    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan Compensation policies and Plan features that protect shareholder interests   \nOur compensation policies and practices, along with the terms of the BACEP, will  \ncontinue to include a number of features intended to protect the interests of     \nshareholders.                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                  The Compensation and Human      \n                                                  Capital Committee reviews the   \n                For the sixth year since 2017,    dilutive impact of Bank of      \n                we are recognizing our            America\u2019s stock program,        \n                teammates with Sharing Success    including by monitoring its     \n                compensation awards.

A copy of the BACEP, approved by\nthe Board in March 2023, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. The   \nproposed amendment and restatement will become effective only if the BACEP is     \napproved by our shareholders.                                                     \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    87  \n                              \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan Number of shares The BACEP, as last approved by shareholders in 2021,        \nprovides that the aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for    \ngrants of awards under the Plan from and after January 1, 2015 will not exceed the\nsum of (i) 450 million shares plus (ii) any shares that were subject to an award  \nas of December 31, 2014 under the BACEP, if such award is cancelled, terminates,  \nexpires, lapses or is settled in cash for any reason from and after January 1,    \n2015 plus (iii) effective upon April 24, 2019, 150 million shares plus (iv)       \neffective upon April 20, 2021, 115 million shares. As of March 1, 2023 there were \napproximately 78 million common shares available for future awards under the      \nBACEP. The amendment and restatement, if approved by shareholders, would increase \nthe number of shares available for awards by 75 million shares, to approximately  \n153 million shares estimated based on information available on March 1, 2023.     \nUnder the BACEP, each award, whether granted as a stock option, SAR, restricted   \nstock share or restricted stock unit, counts against the available share pool as  \none share for each share awarded. The share re-useprovisions under the BACEP do   \nnot include any \u201cliberal share counting\u201d features for stock options or SARs.      \nShares used to cover the exercise price of stock options or to cover any tax      \nwithholding obligations in connection with awards of stock options or SARs will   \ncontinue to be unavailable for awards under the BACEP. In addition, the total     \nnumber of shares covering stock-settled SARs or net-settledoptions will be counted\nagainst the pool of available shares, not just the net shares issued upon         \nexercise. However, as amended, the BACEP will allow shares withheld to cover any  \ntax withholding obligations in connection with awards of restricted stock or      \nrestricted stock units to again be available for future awards under the BACEP.   \nShares covered by awards will also continue to be available for awards if and to  \nthe extent (a) the award is cancelled or forfeited or (b) the award is settled in \ncash. Administration The Compensation and Human Capital Committee administers the \nBACEP. To the extent permitted by law, the Compensation and Human Capital         \nCommittee may designate an individual or committee (which need not consist of     \ndirectors) to act as the appropriate committee under the BACEP for granting awards\nto employees who are not \u201cofficers\u201d under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Under   \nthe BACEP, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authority with respect\nto the following:                                                                 \n                                                                           \n  \u2022    the selection of the employees to receive awards from time to time  \n                                                                           \n                                                           \n  \u2022    the granting of awards in amounts as it determines  \n                                                           \n                                                                               \n  \u2022    the imposition of limitations, restrictions and conditions upon awards  \n                                                                               \n                                                                                \n  \u2022    the certification of the attainment of performance goals, if applicable  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n       the interpretation of the BACEP and the adoption, amendment and            \n  \u2022    rescission of administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations    \n       relating to the BACEP                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    the correction of any defect or omission or reconciliation of any          \n       inconsistency in the BACEP or any award granted under the BACEP            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       the making of all other determinations and taking of all other actions     \n  \u2022    necessary or advisable for the implementation and administration of the    \n       BACEP                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Board will continue to administer grants of restricted stock under the BACEP  \nto non-employeedirectors. Eligibility Employees of Bank of America and its        \nsubsidiaries may participate in the BACEP, as selected by the Compensation and    \nHuman Capital Committee. Eligible employees are those employees of Bank of America\nand its subsidiaries who have made, or are expected to make, important            \ncontributions to our business, as determined by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee, including persons employed outside the United States. Approximately    \n200,000 employees are expected to be eligible to participate. However, as         \nmentioned above, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee in its discretion   \nselects which employees will receive any awards. The BACEP also provides for      \nawards of restricted stock to non-employeedirectors as part of our director       \ncompensation program. All 13 of the non-employeedirectors nominated for election  \nat the annual meeting are eligible to receive these restricted stock awards. As   \nnoted elsewhere in this proxy statement, as part of our director compensation     \nprogram, our Board grants restricted stock to directors on the day of their       \nelection or appointment as a director. Any director nominee that receives at least\na majority of votes cast at the annual meeting will be elected at the annual      \nmeeting and will be eligible to receive the restricted stock award as part of     \ntheir 2023-2024 director compensation. In the event this proposed amendment and   \nrestatement does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual  \nmeeting, and the amendment and restatement does not become effective, there are   \nenough common shares remaining for issuance to grant directors elected at the     \nannual meeting the 2023-2024 restricted stock award.                              \n                         \n  88    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan Types of awards The BACEP permits awards of stock options, SARs, restricted  \nstock shares and restricted stock units to employees and restricted stock shares  \nto non-employeedirectors, all of which are described in more detail below. Awards \nof stock options and SARs . The BACEP provides for the grant of options to        \npurchase shares of our common stock at option prices which are not less than the  \nfair market value of a share of our common stock at the close of business on the  \ndate of grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of March  \n1, 2023, was $34.14.) The BACEP also provides for the grant of SARs to employees. \nSARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares of our     \ncommon stock or a combination of the two, as the Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee in its discretion may determine, with a value equal to the difference   \nbetween: (i) the fair market value on the exercise date of the shares with respect\nto which a SAR is exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the shares on the  \ndate of grant. Awards of options under the BACEP, which may be either incentive   \nstock options (which qualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock     \noptions, are determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. No more  \nthan an aggregate of 450 million shares may be awarded as incentive stock options \nunder the BACEP. The terms and conditions of each option and SAR are to be        \ndetermined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (or its designees) at  \nthe time of grant. Options and SARs granted under the BACEP will expire not more  \nthan 10 years from the date of grant, and the award agreements entered into with  \neach participant will specify the extent to which options and SARs may be         \nexercised during their respective terms, including in the event of the            \nparticipant\u2019s death, disability or termination of employment. The BACEP includes  \ntwo additional limitations on stock option and SAR grants.                        \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The BACEP expressly prohibits dividend equivalents with respect to stock   \n       options and SARs.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, the BACEP prohibits the   \n       sale, transfer, pledge, assignment, or other alienation or hypothecation   \n  \u2022    (including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the         \n       foregoing restrictions, third-party financial institutions) of             \n       nonqualified stock options and SARS.                                       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board has not granted stock options or SARs since 2008. Awards of restricted  \nstock shares and restricted stock units . Under the BACEP, the Compensation and   \nHuman Capital Committee may award employees restricted shares of our common stock \nor restricted stock units which represent the right to receive shares of our      \ncommon stock (or cash equal to the fair market value of those shares). Each award \nagreement will contain the terms of the award, including any applicable           \nconditions, which may include continued service of the participant, the attainment\nof specified performance goals or any other conditions deemed appropriate by the  \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee. Restricted stock shares will be held in \nour custody until the applicable restrictions have been satisfied. The participant\ncannot sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate        \n(including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing      \nrestrictions, third-party financial institutions) restricted stock shares until   \nthe applicable restrictions are satisfied. Once the restrictions are satisfied,   \nthe shares will be delivered to the participant\u2019s account, free of restrictions.  \nDuring the period of restriction, the participant may exercise full voting rights \nwith respect to the restricted stock shares. The award agreement for any          \nrestricted stock units will specify whether units that become earned and payable  \nwill be settled in shares of our common stock (with one share of common stock to  \nbe delivered for each earned and payable restricted stock unit), in cash (equal to\nthe aggregate fair market value of the restricted stock units that are earned and \npayable), or in a combination of shares and cash. Shares of our common stock used \nto pay earned restricted stock units may have additional restrictions, as         \ndetermined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. The BACEP also        \nprovides for awards of restricted stock shares to our non-employeedirectors as    \npart of our director compensation program. These awards vest one year after the   \ndate of grant or, if earlier, at the date of the next annual meeting. However,    \nawards that are scheduled to vest in less than 50 weeks after the date of grant   \nwill count against the 5% exception pool for the minimum vesting requirements     \ndescribed below. The awards vest earlier in case of death or a change in control. \nIf a non-employeedirector retires before the one-yearvesting date, a prorated     \namount of the award vests based on the number of days the non-employeedirector    \nserved during the vesting period before retirement. Awards may be deferred under  \nthe Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan. See \u201cDirector             \ncompensation\u201d on page 50 for additional details about our director compensation   \nprogram. Subject to the terms of the BACEP and any applicable award agreement, a  \nparticipant may be entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents with     \nrespect to an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Dividends or   \ndividend equivalents may be credited as cash or as additional shares or units.    \nHowever, under the amended terms of the BACEP, in no event will dividends or      \ndividend equivalents vest or otherwise be paid out prior to the time that the     \nunderlying award (or portion thereof) has vested and, accordingly, any such       \ndividends or dividend equivalents will be subject to cancellation and forfeiture  \nif the underlying award does not vest (including both time-based and performance- \nbased awards).                                                                    \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    89  \n                              \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan Minimum vesting conditions The BACEP provides that generally all stock-      \nsettled awards will vest no more quickly than ratably annually as of each         \nanniversary over a three-year period beginning on the grant date of the award.    \nThis requirement does not apply to (i) certain substitute awards arising from     \nacquisitions; (ii) shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash incentive awards;\n(iii) awards to non-employeedirectors that vest on the earlier of the one year    \nanniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of shareholders (but  \nnot sooner than 50 weeks after the grant date); or (iv) awards that vest based on \nthe achievement of performance goals over a period of at least one year. Also, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee may grant equity-based awards without    \nregard to the minimum vesting requirement with respect to a maximum of 5% of the  \navailable share reserve authorized for issuance under the BACEP. In addition, the \nminimum vesting requirement does not apply to the Compensation and Human Capital  \nCommittee\u2019s discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any\naward, including in cases of retirement, workforce reduction, death, disability,  \nor a change in control, in the terms of the award or otherwise. Section 162(m)    \naward limits Prior to 2018, awards under the BACEP could be designed to qualify as\n\u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d that were intended to be exempt from the         \ndeduction limits under Section 162(m) of the Code. Under the pre-2018Section      \n162(m) rules, the plan under which awards were granted had to include certain     \nshareholder-approved individual award limits in order for awards to qualify as    \nperformance-based compensation. The BACEP included such individual award limits,  \nwhich were limited to options/SARs and performance-based restricted stock and     \nrestricted stock unit awards that were intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) \nperformance-based compensation exception. Although changes in the U.S. tax laws   \nmade by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the \u201cperformance-based       \ncompensation\u201d exception for grants made from and after January 1, 2018, the BACEP \ncontinues to include award limits, by which a participant may not be granted in   \nany calendar year: (i) stock options or SARs for more than 4,000,000 shares, or   \n(ii) performance-based restricted stock shares/units for more than 4,000,000      \nshares (assuming maximum performance). Withholding for payment of taxes The BACEP \nprovides for the withholding and payment by a participant of any payroll or       \nwithholding taxes required by applicable law. The BACEP permits a participant to  \nsatisfy this requirement, with the approval of the Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee and subject to the terms of the BACEP, by withholding from the          \nparticipant a number of shares of the company\u2019s common stock otherwise issuable   \nunder the award having a fair market value equal to the amount of applicable      \npayroll and withholding taxes. It also permits the company and the participant to \nwithhold at rates up to the maximum statutory tax rates. Adjustments for changes  \nin capitalization In the event of any change in the number of our outstanding     \nshares of common stock by reason of any stock dividend, split, spin-              \noff,recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares or   \notherwise, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock with respect to     \nwhich awards may be made under the BACEP, the annual limit on individual awards,  \nthe limits on incentive stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units\nand the terms, types of shares and number of shares of any outstanding awards     \nunder the BACEP will be equitably adjusted by the Compensation and Human Capital  \nCommittee in its discretion to preserve the benefit of the award for us and the   \nparticipant. No single trigger vesting upon a change in control for employees The \nBACEP permits the Compensation and Human Capital Committee to provide for vesting \nof awards to employees in connection with a change in control of Bank of America  \nif there is also a termination of employment in connection with the change in     \ncontrol. This is often referred to as \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting. For these         \npurposes, a termination is considered to be in connection with a change in control\nif it occurs upon or within two years after the change in control and is for one  \nof the following two reasons: (i) an involuntary termination by the company       \nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or (ii) a termination by the participant for \u201cgood reason.\u201d       \n\u201cCause\u201d and \u201cgood reason\u201d will be as defined in the applicable award agreements.  \nIn addition, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee may provide for the     \nassumption or substitution of awards by a surviving corporation. Awards to non-   \nemployeedirectors fully vest upon a change in control. Amendment and termination  \nof the Plan Our Board has the power to amend, modify or terminate the BACEP on a  \nprospective basis, provided that no termination, amendment or modification shall  \nadversely affect in any material way any award previously granted under the Plan  \nwithout the written consent of any affected participant. Shareholder approval will\nbe obtained for any change to the material terms of the BACEP to the extent       \nrequired by NYSE listing requirements or other applicable law. The BACEP, as      \namended, automatically terminates at the close of business on April 24, 2033      \nfollowing which no awards may be made under the BACEP.                            \n                         \n  90    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 5: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank of America Corporation Equity  \nPlan Option and SARs repricing prohibited The BACEP specifically prohibits the    \nrepricing of stock options or SARs without shareholder approval. For this purpose,\na \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the following (or any other action that has the same   \neffect as any of the following): (i) changing the terms of a stock option or SAR  \nto lower its exercise price; (ii) any other action that is treated as a           \n\u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting principles; and (iii) repurchasing\nfor cash or canceling a stock option or SAR at a time when its exercise price is  \ngreater than the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another\naward, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with change in   \ncapitalization or similar change. Such cancellation and exchange would be         \nconsidered a \u201crepricing\u201d regardless of whether it is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d     \nunder generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is    \nvoluntary on the part of the employee. Federal income tax treatment The following \ndiscussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards under\nthe BACEP based on the law as in effect on the date of this document. The         \nfollowing discussion does not purport to cover federal employment taxes or other  \nfederal tax consequences that may be employed with awards, nor does it cover      \nstate, local or non-U.S.taxes. Nonqualified stock options. A participant generally\nwill not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified     \nstock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the    \nexercise of a nonqualified stock option, a participant generally will recognize   \ncompensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference      \nbetween the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the    \ndate of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option. When a participant   \nsells the shares, the participant will have short-term or long-term capital gain  \nor loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount the       \nparticipant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax  \nbasis of the shares generally will be equal to the fair market value of the shares\non the exercise date. Incentive stock options. A participant generally will not   \nrecognize taxable income upon the grant of an incentive stock option. If a        \nparticipant exercises an incentive stock option during employment or within three \nmonths after employment ends (12 months in the case of permanent and total        \ndisability), the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of     \nexercise for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes (although the participant   \ngenerally will have taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes at that   \ntime as if the stock option were a nonqualified stock option). If a participant   \nsells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive  \nstock option after the later of (a) one year from the date the participant        \nexercised the option and (b) two years from the grant date of the stock option,   \nthe participant generally will recognize long-term capital gain or loss equal to  \nthe difference between the amount the participant received in the disposition and \nthe exercise price of the stock option. If a participant sells or otherwise       \ndisposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before     \nthese holding period requirements are satisfied, the disposition will constitute a\n\u201cdisqualifying disposition,\u201d and the participant generally will recognize taxable \nordinary income in the year of disposition equal to the excess of the fair market \nvalue of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock  \noption (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the  \nshares over the exercise price of the stock option). The balance of the           \nparticipant\u2019s gain on a disqualifying disposition, if any, will be taxed as short-\nterm or long-term capital gain, as the case may be. With respect to both          \nnonqualified stock options and incentive stock options, special rules apply if a  \nparticipant uses shares of common stock already held by the participant to pay the\nexercise price or if the shares received upon exercise of the stock option are    \nsubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the participant. Stock appreciation\nrights. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant  \nor vesting of a SAR with a grant price at least equal to the fair market value of \nour common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the\nexercise of a SAR, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as \nordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value\nof the shares underlying the SAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of   \nthe SAR. Restricted stock shares and restricted stock units. A participant        \ngenerally will not have taxable income upon the grant of restricted stock or      \nrestricted stock units. Instead, the participant will recognize ordinary income at\nthe time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value (on the vesting or   \npayout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount paid. For restricted \nstock only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at the time of grant. Tax \nconsequences to Bank of America. In the foregoing cases, we generally will be     \nentitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same amount, as a participant\nrecognizes ordinary income, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Code,\nincluding those imposed by Section 162(m) as applicable. New stock plan benefits  \nBecause awards under the BACEP are discretionary, awards are generally not        \ndeterminable at this time. As stated previously, in the event the proposed        \namendment and restatement is not approved by shareholders at the annual meeting,  \nthere are enough shares remaining under the Plan for the Board to grant restricted\nstock awards to directors elected at the annual meeting as part of 2023-2024      \ndirector compensation.                                                            \n

                            \nAs noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, we actively seek engagement with      \nshareholders to solicit their views on different matters of importance to them.

Of the six shareholder proposals set forth below, none of the          \nproponents attempted to engage with our company prior to submitting their         \nproposal. We sought to engage with the proponents after we received their         \nproposals and engaged with all of the proponents or their representatives, other  \nthan the National Center for Public Policy, on the substance of their proposals,. \nWe acknowledge the rights of shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in our\nproxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. We also encourage shareholders that \nhave questions or would like additional information about our practices or        \npolicies, or that are contemplating submitting a proposal for inclusion in our    \nproxy statement, to contact us beforehand to allow for a constructive discussion  \nof their concerns. See \u201cShareholder proposals for our 2024 annual meeting\u201d on page\n112. Proposal 6: Independent board chair National Legal and Policy Center, 107    \nPark Washington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046, the beneficial owner of 166  \nshares of the company\u2019s common stock, has advised us that it intends to present   \nthe following resolution: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt  \nas policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary, to require hereafter   \nthat that two separate people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of   \nthe CEO as follows: Selection of the Chairman of the Board:The Board requires the \nseparation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive    \nOfficer. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent     \nDirector. The Board may select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an    \nIndependent Director to serve while the Board seeks an Independent Chairman of the\nBoard. The Chairman shall not be a former CEO of the company. Selection of the    \nChairman of the Board shall be consistent with applicable law and existing        \ncontracts. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: The Chief Executive Officer of Bank of America   \nCorporation is also a Board Chairman. We believe these roles \u2013 each with separate,\ndifferent responsibilities that are critical to the health of a successful        \ncorporation \u2013 are greatly diminished when held by a singular company official,    \nthus weakening its governance structure. Expert perspectives substantiate our     \nposition:                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       According to the Council of Institutional Investors (                      \n       https://bit.ly/3pKrtJK ), \u201cA CEO who also serves as chair can exert        \n  \u2022    excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board\u2019s     \n       oversight of management. Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces    \n       this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation   \n       of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.\u201d                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A 2014 report from Deloitte ( https://bit.ly/3vQGqel ) concluded, \u201cThe     \n  \u2022    chairman should lead the board and there should be a clear division of     \n       responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive officer      \n       (CEO).\u201d                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A pair of business law professors wrote for Harvard Business Review        \n       (https://bit.ly/3xvcIOA ) in March 2020 that \u201cletting the CEO chair the    \n       board can compromise board discussion quality, weakening the               \n  \u2022    corporation\u2019s risk management ability\u2026 Splitting the CEO and board chair   \n       jobs between two people can help strengthen the quality of questions the   \n       corporation asks itself.

Further, we believe that the separation of those two key       \n       roles eliminates the conflict of interest that inevitably occurs when a    \n       CEO is responsible for self-oversight.\u201d                                    \n                                                                                  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 6 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       Our shareholders have repeatedly affirmed that the Board should retain     \n  \u2022    the flexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership           \n       structure based on applicable circumstances and needs;                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Our current Board leadership structure and governance practices provide    \n       robust and effective independent Board oversight;                          \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    93  \n                              \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals                                              \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The Board regularly evaluates and reviews the Board\u2019s leadership           \n       structure;                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                             \n  \u2022    The Board regularly seeks and considers input from shareholders; and  \n                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n       There is no conclusive evidence demonstrating that an independent Chair    \n  \u2022    ensures superior governance or performance, and Board flexibility to       \n       determine the optimal leadership structure is the norm at other large      \n       companies.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nOur shareholders have repeatedly affirmed that the Board should retain the        \nflexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership structure based on   \napplicable circumstances and needs.Our shareholders have voted on our Board\u2019s     \nleadership structure multiple times since 2015. At a special meeting in September \n2015 convened solely for shareholders to voice their opinion on this topic, over  \n62% of votes cast by our shareholders voted to ratify bylaws that grant our Board \nthe flexibility to determine its leadership structure, including appointing an    \nindependent Chair or appointing a Lead Independent Director when the Chair is not \nan independent director. At our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings, we again heard from\nshareholders on this topic when they voted on proposals nearly identical to this  \nProposal. At each meeting, over 67% of the votes cast by our shareholders voted   \nagainst the proposal and in favor of the Board retaining flexibility to determine \nthe most effective leadership structure based on applicable circumstances and     \nneeds. This flexibility allows the Board to determine the most suitable Board     \nleadership structure for the company in accordance with the Board\u2019s changing needs\nand circumstances in order to continue to protect and enhance long-term           \nshareholder value. The Board does not believe that one singular, fixed leadership \nmodel is universally or permanently appropriate in all circumstances. In deciding \nwhether an independent Chair or a Lead Independent Director is right for the      \ncompany at any particular time, the choice should be contextual rather than       \nmechanical, tailored to the then-present needs and opportunities of the company.  \nThe Board, in fulfilling its fiduciary duties, should not be prevented from       \nselecting the individual it believes is most qualified and best positioned to act \nas Chair. It is the Board\u2019s independence, experience, and judgment in exercising  \nits fiduciary duties upon which our shareholders rely to protect their interests. \nThis Proposal would inhibit the Board\u2019s ability to utilize its experience and     \njudgment, and the ongoing input it receives from shareholders, to make well-      \ninformed decisions regarding the Board\u2019s leadership structure. Our current Board  \nleadership structure and governance practices provide robust and effective        \nindependent Board oversight.Our Board is committed to strong, independent Board   \nleadership and views the provision of independent and objective oversight as      \ncentral to effective Board governance and to acting in the best interests of the  \ncompany and our shareholders. The Board believes that independent board oversight \ninvolves not only having a properly designated independent board leader, such as  \nan empowered Lead Independent Director, when the Chair is the CEO, but also having\nrobust governance structures that promote active oversight. Our Board embraces    \nmultiple interlinked practices to provide that the Board as a whole functions     \neffectively and provides robust independent oversight. These include:             \n                                                                                  \n       Regular reviews of our Board leadership structure and governance           \n  \u2022    practices, taking into account contemporaneous shareholder and             \n       stakeholder perspectives;                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A robust, well-defined, and transparent Lead Independent Director role     \n       that is utilized when our Chair is not an independent director, and that   \n       empowers the Lead Independent Director with extensive authority and        \n       responsibilities. The Lead Independent Director position, along with its   \n  \u2022    duties and responsibilities, is formalized in our Corporate Governance     \n       Guidelines, which are regularly reviewed. These comprehensive duties and   \n       responsibilities give our Lead Independent Director significant authority  \n       with respect to the operation and functioning of the Board, and are        \n       described in more detail on pages 24 and 25 of this proxy statement;       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Active leadership, involvement, and influence by the Lead Independent      \n       Director, including by: holding regular executive sessions of our          \n       independent directors only outside the presence of management during       \n       Board meetings, with the Lead Independent Director presiding and           \n       developing topics of discussion; maintaining regular discussions with and  \n       serving as liaison between our CEO and the other independent directors in  \n  \u2022    between Board meetings; meeting with members of management at least        \n       quarterly; having regular calls with our primary bank regulators;          \n       reviewing and approving Board meeting agendas; and playing a central role  \n       in overseeing and participating in shareholder engagement efforts (see     \n       page 35 of this proxy statement for a description of the over 110          \n       meetings our Lead Independent Director had with institutional              \n       shareholders since being named successor to the role at the end of 2020);  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Diverse, experienced, and skilled Board members, all of whom are           \n       independent aside from the CEO. An independent director chairs each        \n  \u2022    standing committee of the Board, with membership on each such committee    \n       consisting entirely of independent directors. This approach empowers and   \n       entrusts our independent directors with oversight of critical issues       \n       within the purview of these committees; and                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Robust, multi-faceted Board and committee self-evaluations, which include  \n       quarterly one-on-one discussions with our Lead Independent Director and    \n  \u2022    an annual formal self-evaluation, and thoughtful director succession       \n       practices. Our Board continues to refresh its composition\u2014four new         \n       independent directors have joined our Board since the 2017 annual          \n       meeting.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nWe believe these practices, coupled with our Board\u2019s other governance processes,  \nprovide for strong, independent Board leadership and effective engagement with,   \nand oversight of, management. The Board regularly evaluates and reviews the       \nBoard\u2019s leadership structure.The Board evaluates and reviews the Board\u2019s          \nleadership structure at least annually to determine what, if any, changes are     \nappropriate based on the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s then-existing needs and            \ncircumstances, and in light of input from shareholders and other stakeholders. In \nthe past six years, our shareholders have twice reaffirmed the Board\u2019s authority  \nto make these critical Board leadership decisions through formal shareholder votes\non shareholder proposals similar to the Proposal. The Board also receives input   \nthrough our regular engagement with shareholders, which is described in more      \ndetail below.                                                                     \n                         \n  94    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals Providing the Board with flexibility to make \nthese leadership decisions empowers the Board to do what is in the best interests \nof the company and our shareholders. If at any time the Board\u2019s review of its     \nleadership structure resulted in the conclusion that an independent Chair is in   \nthe best interests of our shareholders based on the company\u2019s needs and           \ncircumstances at that time, the Board would appoint an independent Chair to       \naddress those needs and circumstances. The Board\u2019s evaluation process is described\nin more detail on page 26 of this proxy statement. The Board regularly seeks and  \nconsiders input from shareholders.Our Board and management have a demonstrated    \nrecord of engaging with our shareholders and soliciting their input on important  \nmatters, including their views on Board leadership and other topics of interest.  \nOur Board engages in year-round communication with shareholders, and since being  \nnamed the Lead Independent Director successor at the end of 2020, our Lead        \nIndependent Director has participated in over 110 meetings with institutional     \nshareholders representing approximately 33% of our outstanding shares. At 6       \nmeetings of the Board, 3 meetings of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and           \nSustainability Committee, and 5 meetings of the Compensation and Human Capital    \nCommittee in 2022, management and independent directors presented information     \nabout the company\u2019s shareholder engagement activities, including input from       \nshareholders. The Board, Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, \nand Compensation and Human Capital Committee have used this input to inform       \nreviews of, among other things, corporate governance policies and processes, ESG  \nactivities, executive compensation structure, and proxy statement disclosures. The\nBoard recognizes that certain shareholders prefer an independent Chair at all     \ncompanies at all times and are therefore likely to support the Proposal. However, \nduring our recent engagement meetings, far more shareholders have expressed their \nsupport for the Board\u2019s continued flexibility to determine the Board\u2019s leadership \nstructure based on the company\u2019s needs and circumstances at any given time. There \nis no conclusive evidence demonstrating that an independent Chair ensures superior\ngovernance or performance, and Board flexibility to determine the optimal         \nleadership structure is the norm at other large companies.While the Board         \nrecognizes and respects different points of view and philosophies about which     \nleadership structure supports the best operational or governance results, existing\nempirical data concerning the impact of board leadership on shareholder value do  \nnot conclusively establish any correlation between the presence of an independent \nchair and superior corporate governance or performance. Even as the general       \nempirical evidence remains inconclusive, under the current Board leadership       \nstructure:                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n       The Board has sharpened its focus on corporate governance and established  \n       leading governance and disclosure practices (see \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d    \n       beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement), with the Board\u2019s Lead       \n  \u2022    Independent Director named \u201cIndependent Director of the Year\u201d by           \n       Corporate Board Member in 2022 in recognition \u201cfor his work helping to     \n       guide one of the world\u2019s most important financial institutions\u201d through a  \n       challenging environment, with superior results for the company and its     \n       stakeholders.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our company continues to execute on our long-term strategy and focus on    \n       Responsible Growth\u2014a strategy conceived under the vision of our current    \n       Chair and CEO, and developed with the evaluation and unanimous support of  \n       the Board\u2019s independent directors\u2014to propel our company\u2019s operating and    \n       financial performance and deliver for our clients, employees, and the      \n  \u2022    communities we serve\u2014and for our shareholders. Under Responsible Growth,   \n       our current Chair and CEO\u2019s leadership, and with independent oversight     \n       from our Lead Independent Directors and other independent Board members,   \n       the company has made continuous investments in people, technology, and     \n       facilities, and is consistently disciplined in its approach to risk        \n       management. We are one of four U.S. companies that has reported over $15\u00a0  \n       billion in net income for eight years in a row (2015-2022).                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       In 2022, the company continued to demonstrate how Responsible Growth       \n       enables us to deliver for our clients, teammates, communities, and         \n       shareholders in any environment. From 2017 to 2022, our annual earnings    \n       increased more than 50% to $27.5\u00a0billion, our customer deposit levels      \n       grew $621\u00a0billion to $1.9 trillion, our loans grew $109\u00a0billion to $1      \n  \u2022    trillion, and our Tier 1 capital increased to $208\u00a0billion, even after     \n       the company returned $117\u00a0billion in capital to shareholders over this     \n       time in common stock dividends and repurchases. In January 2023, the       \n       company was recognized as America\u2019s Most JUST Company, ranking no. 1 on    \n       JUST Capital and CNBC\u2019s 2023 Ranking of America\u2019s Most Just Companies      \n       marking the first year a financial services company has led the list.      \n                                                                                  \nAccording to the most recent surveys reported by the Spencer Stuart Board Index,  \nonly 36% of the chairs of S&P 500 companies are independent and 43% of the chairs \nof S&P 500 companies are also the current CEOs. Thus, the company\u2019s existing Board\nleadership structure is consistent with the practice among S&P 500 companies. The \nBoard believes that a one-size-fits-all policymandating an independent Chair is   \nnot in the best interest of our shareholders or our company. Our shareholders     \nsupported this view at the special meeting in 2015 and reaffirmed their support at\nboth our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of shareholders by voting to maintain the  \nBoard\u2019s flexibility to determine the most effective and appropriate leadership    \nstructure. They continue to express support during our ongoing engagements.       \nAlthough our shareholders continue to endorse the Board having the necessary      \nflexibility, the Board is committed to regularly reviewing its leadership         \nstructure and Board practices and to responsibly determining its most appropriate \nstructure based on then-current circumstances and needs.                          \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 6).                         \n                                                      \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    95  \n                              \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals Proposal 7: Shareholder ratification of      \ntermination pay John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue. No. 205, Redondo Beach,       \nCalifornia 90278, the beneficial owner of 250 shares of the company\u2019s common      \nstock, has advised us that he intends to present the following resolution:        \nProposal 7 - Shareholder Ratification of Termination Pay Shareholders request that\nthe Board seek shareholder approval of any senior manager\u2019s new or renewed pay    \npackage that provides for severance or termination payments with an estimated     \nvalue exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive\u2019s base salary plus target     \nshort-term bonus. \u201cSeverance or termination payments\u201d include cash, equity or     \nother pay that is paid out or vests due to a senior executive\u2019s termination for   \nany reason. Payments include those provided under employment agreements, severance\nplans, and change-in-controlclauses in long-term equity plans, but not life       \ninsurance, pension benefits, or deferred pay earned and vested prior to           \ntermination. \u201cEstimated total value\u201d includes: lump-sumpayments; payments         \noffsetting tax liabilities, perquisites or benefits not vested under a plan       \ngenerally available to management employees, post-employment consulting fees or   \noffice expense and equity awards if vesting is accelerated, or a performance      \ncondition waived, due to termination. The Board shall retain the option to seek   \nshareholder approval after material terms are agreed upon. Generous performance-  \nbased pay can sometimes be justified but shareholder ratification of \u201cgolden      \nparachute\u201d severance packages with a total cost exceeding 2.99 times base salary  \nplus target short-term bonus better aligns management pay with shareholder        \ninterests. For instance at one company, that does not have this policy, if the CEO\nis terminated he could receive $44 million in termination pay\u2014over 10 times his   \nbase salary plus short-term bonus. In the event of a change in control, the same  \nperson could receive a whopping $124 million in accelerated equity payouts even if\nhe remained employed. It is in the best interest of Bank of America shareholders  \nand the morale of Bank of America employees to be protected from such lavish      \nmanagement termination pay for one person. It is important to have this policy in \nplace so that Bank of America management stays focused on improving company       \nperformance as opposed to seeking a business combination simply to trigger a      \nmanagement golden parachute windfall.

A full copy of the Severance\nAgreement Approval Policy is available as an exhibit to the company\u2019s Annual      \nReport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2022 (www.sec.gov) and is on   \nthe company\u2019s investor relations website at www.investor.bankofamerica.com. The   \ncompany adopted the Severance Agreement Approval Policy to align with our overall \ncompensation philosophy and to preserve our competitive footing in attracting and \nretaining talented executive officers, while still subjecting termination pay to  \nmeaningful shareholder oversight and approval when appropriate. The Proposal      \neffectively requests that our Severance Agreement Approval Policy be amended to   \nincrease the multiple of severance benefits that do not require shareholder       \napproval from 2x to 2.99 times base salary plus bonus. The Board believes the     \ncurrent Severance Agreement Approval Policy appropriately protects shareholders\u2019  \ninterests by providing shareholders an opportunity to express approval or         \ndisapproval of severance or termination payments, and reflects the expression of  \nshareholders\u2019 concerns as voiced at the 2002 annual shareholders meeting. The     \nBoard believes a vote in favor of the Proposal is not in shareholders\u2019 best       \ninterests as it will operate to lessen shareholders\u2019 abilities to voice their     \nopinion on the same types of severance and termination payments as are currently  \ncovered by the Severance Agreement Approval Policy, by increasing the multiple    \nfrom 2x to 2.99 times the severance or termination payments subject to shareholder\napproval. Because the Severance Agreement Approval Policy was adopted in response \nto a virtually identical proposal, it, like the Proposal, encompasses a wide      \nvariety of compensation arrangements. The Severance Agreement Approval Policy     \napplies to all employment and severance agreements entered into after April 24,   \n2002 with any of the company\u2019s senior executives that provide for severance       \nbenefits, including any renewal, modification or extension of any existing        \nemployment agreement or severance agreement that was in effect as of the effective\ndate of the policy (none of which are currently in effect). For purposes of       \ndetermining whether the amount of severance benefits to be provided exceeds the 2x\nmultiple under the Severance Agreement Approval Policy, severance benefits        \ninclude: (i) severance benefits payable in cash (including cash amounts payable   \nfor the uncompleted portion of an employment agreement); (ii) special benefits or \nperquisites provided for periods following termination of employment; and (iii)   \naccelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards in connection with such          \ntermination of employment, other than the accelerated vesting of equity awards    \nthat otherwise would have vested during the 24-monthperiod following termination  \nof employment. Agreements for future services (other than as an employee), such as\nconsulting agreements, or agreements requiring the senior executive to refrain    \nfrom certain conduct, such as restrictive covenant agreements, are not treated as \nemployment or severance agreements under the Severance Agreement Approval Policy. \nIn addition, compensation and benefits earned or accrued while employed, including\nequity vesting based on becoming retirement-eligible, (2)are not treated as       \nseverance benefits even if paid out following termination of employment. The      \nSeverance Agreement Approval Policy enables the company to provide limited post-  \ntermination benefits in situations the Board believes are appropriate, such as    \ncontinued equity vesting according to the award\u2019s payment schedule in the event of\nretirement after attaining retirement eligibility and provided the executive      \ncomplies with certain covenants including not working for a competitive business  \n(a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d), or accelerated equity vesting upon death or a       \nqualifying termination of employment in connection with a change of control. While\nthe treatment of equity under our Severance Agreement Approval Policy differs     \nslightly from the approach set forth in the Proposal, we believe our existing     \npolicy adopted in response to a virtually identical shareholder proposal,         \naddresses the concerns underlying the Proposal. For example, in situations where  \nthe equity award continues to vest following a Qualifying Termination, the award  \ndoes not continue to vest as a result ofthe executive\u2019s employment termination,   \nbut continues to vest as a result ofthe executive being retirement-eligible. To   \nprotect the company\u2019s and shareholder\u2019s interests, continued vesting following a  \nQualifying Termination is also subject to the executive\u2019s compliance with certain \ncovenants (such as a promise not to work for a competitive business or to solicit \nthe company\u2019s employees for employment or clients for business). Our equity awards\nalso are subject to multiple cancellation and clawback features that can apply    \nafter a Qualifying Termination, including for detrimental conduct, loss outside of\nthe ordinary course of business, fraud or intentional misconduct causing a        \nrestatement of financial statements, and going forward, clawbacks consistent with \nthe final rules of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act for erroneously awarded      \nincentive-based compensation related to an accounting restatement (regardless of  \nmisconduct or fault). Currently none of our executive officers, including our CEO,\nhave employment or severance agreements with the company. Our equity compensation \nplan was approved by shareholders and expressly provides for acceleration of      \noutstanding equity awards in the event of certain termination events in connection\nwith a change in control.The Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan, which was   \napproved by our shareholders with over 96% of the vote at our 2021 annual meeting \nof shareholders, permits the Board\u2019s Compensation and Human Capital Committee to  \nprovide for accelerated vesting only ifthe participant\u2019s employment is terminated \nin connection with a change in control. Our Board believes that this provision,   \nwhich is often referred to as a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d acceleration, encourages         \nexecutive officers to remain with the company during a potential change in        \ncontrol, which further aligns their interests with those of our shareholders when \nevaluating any such potential transaction. Furthermore, due to existing U.S.      \nlegislation that restricts the ability of companies to acquire a bank holding     \ncompany that has greater than 10% of U.S. deposits such as the company ( i.e., the\nRiegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994), and         \nrestrictions on non-financialservices business activities imposed on bank holding \ncompanies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and                          \n                                                                                  \n       As noted in the discussion in this proxy statement of \u201cPotential payments  \n       upon termination or change in control\u201d on page 76, each of the named       \n  (2)  executive officers meets the applicable age and years-of-service           \n       requirements to qualify for continued vesting of their equity awards       \n       following retirement.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    97  \n                              \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals related regulations promulgated by the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Office of the Comptroller of the   \nCurrency, the likelihood of a change in control of the company is remote.         \nShareholders already have opportunities to express their views about our post-    \ntermination compensation policies.In addition to opportunities to approve         \nseverance or termination payments as provided by the Severance Agreement Approval \nPolicy, our Board and management team value shareholder input and proactively     \nengaged with and solicited input from our shareholders regarding our executive    \ncompensation programs and philosophy. In 2022, we held 48 engagement meetings with\n35 shareholders representing approximately 52% of our outstanding shares held by  \ninstitutional shareholders, with our Lead Independent Director attending          \napproximately 88% of these meeting, and, at the majority of these meetings, we    \ndiscussed our executive compensation program, human capital management, and other \nrelated matters. At our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, over 94% of the      \nshareholder votes cast supported our annual \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote\u2014this represents the \n12 thconsecutive year of \u201cSay on Pay\u201d approval of 92% or higher. Our Board\u2019s      \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee and management team routinely discuss the\ninput from shareholders on our overall executive compensation program, including  \nshareholder support levels for \u201cSay on Pay\u201d, and consider whether action should be\ntaken in response. These ongoing efforts to solicit shareholder input on our      \ncompensation program allow for year-round shareholder input and provide additional\nsupport for why the approval requirements set forth in the Proposal are           \nunnecessary. Our executive compensation program effectively aligns executive and  \nshareholders\u2019 interests.Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over\nthe long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our Board has designed our current  \nexecutive compensation program to appropriately link compensation realized by our \nexecutive officers to our performance and properly align the interests of our     \nexecutive officers with those of our shareholders. Our executive compensation     \nprogram provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align\nexecutive officer and shareholder interests. Our long-term equity-based awards,   \nwhich are a fundamental component of our compensation program, further align      \nexecutive officer and shareholder interests by linking a substantial portion of   \ncompensation to the achievement of sustainable, long-term corporate performance   \nand operational efficiency.                                                       \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 7).                         \n                                                      \nProposal 8: Shareholder proposal requesting greenhouse gas reduction targets The  \nNew York State Common Retirement Fund, 110 State Street, Albany, New York 12236,  \nthe beneficial owner of 14,418,951 shares of the company\u2019s common stock, and one  \nco-filerhave advised us that they intend to present the following resolution:     \nAbsolute Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets RESOLVED: Shareholders request Bank of  \nAmerica (\u201cCompany\u201d) issue a report within a year, at reasonable expense and       \nexcluding confidential information, that discloses 2030 absolute greenhouse gas   \nemissions reduction targets for the Company\u2019s energy sector lending and           \nunderwriting, aligned with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal to limit warming to 1.5     \ndegrees Celsius. These targets should be in addition to any emission intensity    \ntargets for the energy sector that the company has or will set, and be aligned    \nwith a science-based net zero pathway. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: The Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) has advised that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions    \nmust be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to limit global warming to      \n1.5\u00b0C. (1)Every incremental increase in temperature above 1.5\u00b0C will entail       \nincreasingly severe physical, transition, and systemic risks to companies,        \ninvestors, the markets, and the economy as a whole. Climate change mitigation is  \ntherefore critical to address investment risks in order to avert the large        \neconomic losses projected to occur if insufficient action is taken. Emissions from\nthe oil and gas industry are responsible for over 40% of global GHG emissions and \nare therefore significant to Bank of America\u2019s climate-risk mitigation strategy.  \nThe company should adopt absolute emission targets in this sector to protect the  \nCompany and its long-term investors. Though the Company has a commitment to reach \nnet zero emissions by 2050 and a target to reduce its GHG emissions intensity for \nthe energy sector, defined as upstream producers, refiners, and integrated        \ncompanies within the oil and gas industry, by 2030, it does not yet have a        \nscience-based 2030 target to reduce GHG emissions on an absolute basis. Intensity \ntargets will measure the reduction in emissions per unit or per dollar, however,  \nby definition, they will not capture whether the Company\u2019s total financed GHG     \nemissions have decreased in the real world. Rather, we believe the Company should \nconsider target-setting approaches used by advisory groups such as the Science    \nBased Targets initiative. Such an absolute reduction target aligned with a        \nscience-based net zero emissions pathway is critical for the Company to achieve   \nits net-zerocommitment and more fully address its climate risks.                  \n                                                    \n  (1)  https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/.  \n                                                    \n                         \n  98    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals The Company trails its peers in setting      \nabsolute GHG emissions reduction targets. Citigroup has committed to reducing its \nabsolute emissions for the energy sector by 29% by 2030. Wells Fargo has set a    \ntarget to reduce absolute emissions for the oil and gas sector by 26% by 2030.    \nHSBC has also committed to reducing absolute emissions for the oil and gas sector \nby 34% by 2030. By setting absolute targets in addition to its intensity targets  \nin the energy sector, the Company can ensure it is moving toward its stated       \ncommitments and real-economy emissions reductions.

As part of that      \ncommitment, we have outlined our strategy to finance the transition to net zero   \nemissions and issued our first emissions reduction targets for financing          \nactivities in April 2022. We are also transparent in reporting on how we plan to  \nachieve the net zero transition, how we align our net zero commitment with the    \nevolving needs of our clients and how we continue to develop and issue GHG        \nreduction targets as part of our climate transition strategy. We disclose both our\nabsolute financed emissions and economic intensities in our 2022 TCFD report so   \nstakeholders can track our progress over time.

We are also focused on supporting and financing     \nareas that are critical to the transition from a high-carbon to a low-            \ncarbonsociety. Our goal is to deploy and mobilize $1 trillion by 2030 to          \naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon,sustainable economy, as part of a       \nbroader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal aligned to addressing the United   \nNation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022, we mobilized and deployed        \napproximately $158 billion in sustainable finance activity, of which approximately\n$78 billion was for climate and environmental transition. Our multi-year financing\ncommitment provides financial capital, along with significant intellectual        \ncapital, to address the clean energy transition. It focuses on low-carbonenergy,  \nenergy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, in addition to addressing other\nimportant related areas like water conservation, land use and waste. As disclosed \nin our 2022 TCFD Report, (3)we also continue to make significant progress toward  \nachieving our net zero commitment from our operations and supply chain. In our own\noperations, we have been carbon neutral with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions   \nsince 2019, and we purchase renewable energy to meet 100% of our needs to power   \nour operations. In addition to achieving net zero in our operations, we are also  \nworking to reach net zero with respect to indirect emissions generated across our \nentire supply chain. In 2016, we set our first-ever public goals to address GHG   \nemissions in our supply chain \u2013 those goals were focused on supplier engagement.  \nIn 2021, we set our second set of supplier engagement goals, to be achieved by    \n2030, shifting our focus from supplier engagement to driving specific supplier    \ncommitments. Our goal is to have 70% of global suppliers, by spend, set GHG       \nemissions reduction or renewable energy targets. (4) We have set and disclosed    \n2030 targets for reducing emissions related to three key sectors: auto            \nmanufacturing, energy and power generation; and we have committed to set and      \ndisclose financing activity emissions reduction targets for other key high-       \nemitting sectors by April 2024.In April 2022, we announced our first set of       \nemission reduction targets as part of our Approach to Zero clean energy transition\nstrategy (our 2030 Financing Activity Targets). These targets build on our        \ncommitment to establish interim science-based emissions targets for high-emitting \nportfolios. Setting emission reduction targets on our financing activity involves \nevaluating decarbonization scenarios for each sector to determine the amount of   \nemissions reductions required across relevant GHG emissions scopes to achieve net \nzero before 2050. We reviewed multiple scenarios to determine the GHG emissions   \nreduction required for our 2030 Financing Activity Targets, including the Network \nfor Greening the Financial System (NGFS) pathways, and two International Energy   \nAgency (IEA) scenarios: the Sustainable Development Scenario Organization for     \nEconomic Cooperation and Development pathway and the IEA Net Zero Emissions 2050  \n(NZE2050) global pathway. We chose to align our 2030 Financing Activity Targets to\nthe IEA NZE2050 global pathway as it is the only scenario that aligns with a 1.5\u00b0 \npathway to net zero before 2050 and outlines the percentage of emissions reduction\nneeded from 2019 to 2030 for various sectors, sub-sectorsand target types,        \nproviding the necessary detail to develop appropriate and relevant targets for our\nthree selected sectors using 2019 as the baseline. We intend to continue using the\nIEA NZE2050 global scenario to inform our strategy with clients in these sectors. \nOur 2022 TCFD provides additional details about how we developed our 2030         \nFinancing Activity Targets, the rationale for each target and how they align with \nour Approach to Zero transition strategy. We have disclosed our financed emissions\nin our 2022 TCFD report, and in line with our commitment to NZBA, we plan to set  \nfinancing activity emissions reduction targets for other key high-emitting sectors\nby April 2024. As set forth in the NZBA guidelines, we will regularly review our  \ntargets so they remain consistent with current climate science. We are dedicated  \nto supporting low-carbonenergy sources through our lending, investments, products \nand services, and operations.As we work to achieve our net zero commitment, we are\nfocused on financing the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Reducing GHG   \nemissions associated with our financing activity to net zero involves key steps   \noutlined in our Approach to Zero transition strategy. We expect to achieve this   \nshift through engaging with our clients and helping them make progress on their   \nown low-carbonbusiness models, and through partnering with our clients to finance \nthe adoption of low-carbonsolutions. We are developing innovative products that   \npromote this transition, such as credit facilities that are structured to link    \npricing to a client\u2019s carbon reduction efforts, and financial solutions for new   \nand emerging clean energy technologies that will be critical to provide additional\ncarbon reduction beyond traditional renewable energy sources.                     \n                                                                                  \n  (2)  Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework is available at         \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/assets/pdf/Environmental-and-Social-Risk\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our 2022 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)        \n  (3)  Report is available at                                                     \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/BOA_TCFD_2022%209\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                  \n  (4)  See our 2022 TCFD Report.  \n                                  \n                          \n  100    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                          \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals Our Approach to Zero transition strategy     \ndetails how we intend to help our clients transition to a low-carboneconomy and,  \nas described in our 2022 TCFD Report, we continue to make progress in deploying   \nour net zero strategy.Key to achieving the transition to a low-carboneconomy is   \nengaging with our clients. As discussed in our Approach to Zero transition        \nstrategy, we believe that our targeted financing policies and practices, and the  \nrelated risk management practices, align with our net zero commitments. Further,  \nwe also believe that our energy, power and related policies, as outlined in our   \nESRP Framework, support our climate goals and promote the transition to a low-    \ncarboneconomy. As set out in our ESRP Framework, there are certain business       \nactivities that have increased investor, client, employee, and regulator scrutiny.\nThese transactions are evaluated in alignment with our company\u2019s Board-approved   \nRisk Framework, which outlines our company\u2019s approach to risk management, as are  \nall transaction and client decisions, in the ordinary course of business. This    \nprocess is client-specific, deal-specific, and subject to governance review. This \nprocess considers portfolio-level credit, operational, reputational, and other    \nrisks, including climate risk. As part of that process, we have determined not to \nengage in the following activities based on the appropriate application of our    \nRisk Framework and enhanced due diligence standards:                              \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Direct financing of petroleum exploration or production activities in the  \n       Arctic;                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Direct financing of the construction or expansion of new coal-fired power  \n  \u2022    plants\u2014unless those facilities employ technology that is focused on        \n       complete or near elimination of atmospheric carbon emissions; and          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Direct financing of new thermal coal mines or the expansion of existing    \n       mines.                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, as disclosed in our 2022 TCFD Report, as part of our transition      \nstrategy, by 2025 we will phase out all financing (including facilitating capital \nmarkets transactions and advising on mergers and acquisitions) of companies       \nderiving \u226525% of their revenue from thermal coal mining, unless the company has a \npublic commitment to align its business (across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) with  \nthe goals of the Paris Agreement and the transaction would be facilitating the    \ndiversification of the company\u2019s business away from thermal coal. Over the past   \nseveral years, we have reduced exposure to companies focused on coal extraction,  \nwith pure play coal extraction now representing only $42 million, or less than    \n0.01% of our total committed commercial credit exposure across all industries     \nexposure, down more than 94% from $762 million at fiscal year-end2015. In light of\nour disclosures and declared strategy, the issuance of our 2030 Financing Activity\nTargets, and our carefully developed and well-articulated risk management         \nframework, our Board believes that the report requested in Proposal 8, which would\nsubstantially duplicate our existing GHG target development and issuance, would   \nnot be a productive use of time or effort. Further, as disclosed in our TCFD      \nReport, we continue to develop and issue GHG emission reduction targets. We are   \nalso transparent in disclosing these transition-related activities and risks in   \nthe ESRP Framework and our 2022 TCFD Report. Therefore, our Board believes the    \nreport requested by Proposal 8 would be duplicative and unnecessary.              \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 8).                         \n                                                      \nProposal 9: Shareholder proposal requesting report on transition planning Debriana\nBerlin Rev Tr (S), c/o of As You Sow, 2020 Milvia St., Suite 500, Berkeley, CA    \n94704, the beneficial owner of 479 shares of the company\u2019s common stock, and other\nco-filershave advised us that they intend to present the following resolution:    \nTransition Planning RESOLVED:Shareholders request that Bank of America issue a    \nreport disclosing a transition plan that describes how it intends to align its    \nfinancing activities with its 2030 sectoral greenhouse gas emissions reduction    \ntargets, including the specific measures and policies to be implemented,          \nreductions to be achieved by such measures and policies, and timelines for        \nimplementation and associated emission reductions. Whereas:The banking sector has \na critical role to play in achieving global net zero by 2050 goals. The Net Zero  \nBanking Alliance (NZBA) notes that 40 percent of global banking assets have       \ncommitted to aligning lending and investment portfolios with net zero by 2050.    \n(1)But targets alone are insufficient. Investors seek disclosures demonstrating   \nbanks\u2019 concrete transition strategies to credibly achieve their disclosed emission\nreduction targets. Guidelines are emerging to help financial institutions         \noperationalize and translate net zero commitments into strategies \u201cwith specific  \nobjectives . . . against which progress can be assessed.\u201d (2) , (3)               \n                                                  \n  (1)  https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/.  \n                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (2)  https://www.iigcc.org/media/2022/07/An-investor-led-framework-of-pilot-i\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (3)  https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/63/2022/06/GFANZ_Recommendations-a\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    101  \n                               \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals Bank of America (\u201cBofA\u201d) is a member of the  \nNZBA and is the fourth largest global lender and underwriter of fossil fuels, with\n$32 billion in fossil fuel financing in 2021, and over $232 billion between 2016  \nthrough 2021. (4) An effective transition plan creates bank accountability by     \ndescribing the strategies, indicators, milestones, metrics, and timelines to      \ndeliver on decarbonization targets and ensure investors that a bank is addressing \nand accountable for the risks associated with its financing of high carbon        \nactivities. BofA has set forth no such transition plan. In its 2022 TCFD report,  \nBofA identifies 2030 targets for reducing its operational emissions and highlights\nactions to achieve those outcomes. (5)BofA also sets 2030 intensity reduction     \ntargets for the financed emissions from its three highest carbon emitting business\nsectors. However, it does not disclose a transition plan for how it will achieve  \nthese intensity targets, despite their representing a far larger proportion of the\ncompany\u2019s carbon footprint than operational emissions. Instead, BofA makes vague  \nstatements including that it will need to work with its clients to understand     \ntheir commitments and transition plans, and that it will need to modify a number  \nof its internal processes and routines. (6)It further states that it has begun    \ncapturing unspecified client data and that near term foundational steps will focus\non \u201cProcesses and Routines,\u201d \u201cData,\u201d and \u201cReporting and Monitoring.\u201d These vague  \nstatements do not constitute a transition plan likely to achieve BofA\u2019s planned   \nemissions reduction targets. While BofA has committed to a notable $1 trillion in \nlow-carbonsustainable business financing through 2030, it does not disclose any   \nestimate of the emissions reductions such financing will contribute, on what      \ntimeline, or how this compares to its total financed emissions. The disclosures   \nrequested in this proposal will help assure investors that BofA has an effective  \nand accountable transition plan in place for achieving its 2030 intensity goals.  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 9 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       Under our clean energy transition strategy, we are committed to achieving  \n  \u2022    net zero emissions from our operations, supply chain and financing         \n       activities before 2050, and we are transparent about our progress;         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       We have set and disclosed 2030 targets for reducing emissions associated   \n       with financing activities related to three key sectors: auto               \n  \u2022    manufacturing, energy and power generation; and we have committed to set   \n       and disclose financing activity emission reduction targets for other key   \n       high-emitting sectors by April 2024;                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    We are dedicated to supporting low-carbon energy sources through our       \n       lending, investments, products and services, and operations; and           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Approach to Zero transition strategy outlines how we intend to help    \n  \u2022    our clients transition to a low-carbon economy and, as described in our    \n       2022 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report,    \n       we continue to make progress in deploying our net zero strategy.           \n                                                                                  \nProposal 9 requests that we issue a report disclosing a transition plan that      \ndescribes how the company intends to align its financing activities with the 2030 \nsectoral greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that we announced in April    \n2022. As the Proposal acknowledges, our company is committed to reducing the GHG  \nemissions associated with our financing activities in alignment with the Paris    \nAgreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C goal, and to achieving net zero emissions. As part of that      \ncommitment, we have outlined our strategy to finance the transition to net zero   \nemissions and issued our first emissions reduction targets for financing          \nactivities in April 2022. We are also transparent in reporting on how we plan to  \nachieve the net zero transition, how we align our net zero commitment with the    \nevolving needs of our clients and how we continue to develop and issue GHG        \nreduction targets as part of our climate transition strategy. We disclose both our\nabsolute financed emissions and economic intensities in our 2022 TCFD report so   \nstakeholders can track our progress over time. Under our clean energy transition  \nstrategy, we are committed to achieving net zero emissions from our operations,   \nsupply chain and financing activities before 2050, and we are transparent about   \nour progress.Our Approach to Zero strategy, (1)released in April 2022, outlines   \nthe roles that we intend to play to help finance the transition to net zero GHG   \nemissions. Consistent with our approach toward Responsible Growth, we are helping \nfinance this transition by setting and achieving milestone targets, partnering    \nwith clients to support their own declared transitions, investing in clean energy \ninnovation and other solutions, developing and reporting decision-useful metrics  \nto drive progress, leading industry collaborations, and following guidance for    \ntransparency.

Our    \nApproach to Zero climate strategy, which is consistent with our NZBA and PCAF     \nobligations, is based on five pillars that shape our work:                        \n                                                                                  \n  1)  Assist clients in the transition to net zero, including the development of  \n      products and services as well as investment in clean energy solutions;      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  2)  Advocate for consistent industry and global standards to drive comparable   \n      commitments and disclosure;                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  3)  Analyze data to develop decision useful metrics to drive progress, uncover  \n      business opportunities and manage the transition;                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  4)  Align our strategy to the best available science by setting appropriate     \n      milestone targets to reach net zero before 2050; and                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                              \n  5)  Attest annually following the TCFD and NZBA guidance for transparency.  \n                                                                              \nOur Approach to Net Zero, together with our Environmental and Social Risk Policy  \nFramework (ESRP Framework), (2)articulate a comprehensive and pragmatic strategy  \nfor supporting the transition across economic sectors, including clients in energy\nand power systems industries. We are also focused on supporting and financing     \nareas that are critical to the transition from a high-carbon to a low-            \ncarbonsociety. Our goal is to deploy and mobilize $1 trillion by 2030 to          \naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon,sustainable economy, as part of a       \nbroader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal aligned to addressing the United   \nNation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022, we mobilized and deployed        \napproximately $158 billion in sustainable finance activity, of which approximately\n$78 billion was for climate and environmental transition. Our multi-year financing\ncommitment provides financial capital, along with significant intellectual        \ncapital, to address the clean energy transition. It focuses on low-carbonenergy,  \nenergy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, in addition to addressing other\nimportant related areas like water conservation, land use and waste. As disclosed \nin our 2022 TCFD Report, (3)we also continue to make significant progress toward  \nachieving our net zero commitment from our operations and supply chain. In our own\noperations, we have been carbon neutral with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions   \nsince 2019, and we purchase renewable energy to meet 100% (1)of our needs to power\nour operations. In addition to achieving net zero in our operations, we are also  \nworking to reach net zero with respect to indirect emissions generated across our \nentire supply chain. In 2016, we set our first-ever public goals to address GHG   \nemissions in our supply chain \u2013 those goals were focused on supplier engagement.  \nIn 2021, we set our second set of supplier engagement goals, to be achieved by    \n2030, shifting our focus from supplier engagement to driving specific supplier    \ncommitments. Our goal is to have 70% of global suppliers, by spend, set GHG       \nemissions reduction or renewable energy targets. (4) We have set and disclosed    \n2030 targets for reducing emissions related to three key sectors: auto            \nmanufacturing, energy and power generation; and we have committed to set and      \ndisclose financing activity emissions reduction targets for other key high-       \nemitting sectors by April 2024.In April 2022, we announced our first set of       \nemission reduction targets as part of our Approach to Zero clean energy transition\nstrategy (our 2030 Financing Activity Targets). These targets build on our        \ncommitment to establish interim science-based emissions targets for high-emitting \nportfolios. Setting emission reduction targets on our financing activity involves \nevaluating decarbonization scenarios for each sector to determine the amount of   \nemissions reductions required across relevant GHG emissions scopes to achieve net \nzero before 2050. We reviewed multiple scenarios to determine the GHG emissions   \nreduction required for our 2030 Financing Activity Targets, including the Network \nfor Greening the Financial System (NGFS) pathways, and two International Energy   \nAgency (IEA) scenarios: the Sustainable Development Scenario Organization for     \nEconomic Cooperation and Development pathway and the IEA Net Zero Emissions 2050  \n(NZE2050) global pathway. We chose to align our 2030 Financing Activity Targets to\nthe IEA NZE2050 global pathway as it is the only scenario that aligns with a 1.5\u00b0 \npathway to net zero before 2050 and outlines the percentage of emissions reduction\nneeded from 2019 to 2030 for various sectors, sub-sectorsand target types,        \nproviding the necessary detail to develop appropriate and relevant targets for our\nthree selected sectors using 2019 as the baseline. We intend to continue using the\nIEA NZE2050 global scenario to inform our strategy with clients in these sectors. \nOur 2022 TCFD provides additional details about how we developed our 2030         \nFinancing Activity Targets, the rationale for each target and how they align with \nour Approach to Zero transition strategy.                                         \n                                                                                  \n  (2)  Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework is available at         \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/assets/pdf/Environmental-and-Social-Risk\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our 2022 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)        \n  (3)  Report is available at                                                     \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/BOA_TCFD_2022%209\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                  \n  (4)  See our 2022 TCFD Report.  \n                                  \n                               \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    103  \n                               \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals We have disclosed our financed emissions in  \nour 2022 TCFD report, and in line with our commitment to NZBA, we plan to set     \nfinancing activity emissions reduction targets for other key high-emitting sectors\nby April 2024. As set forth in the NZBA guidelines, we will regularly review our  \ntargets so they remain consistent with current climate science. We are dedicated  \nto supporting low-carbonenergy sources through our lending, investments, products \nand services, and operations.As we work to achieve our net zero commitment, we are\nfocused on financing the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Reducing GHG   \nemissions associated with our financing activity to net zero involves key steps   \noutlined in our Approach to Zero transition strategy. We expect to achieve this   \nshift through engaging with our clients and helping them make progress on their   \nown low-carbonbusiness models, and through partnering with our clients to finance \nthe adoption of low-carbonsolutions. We are developing innovative products that   \npromote this transition, such as credit facilities that are structured to link    \npricing to a client\u2019s carbon reduction efforts, and financial solutions for new   \nand emerging clean energy technologies that will be critical to provide additional\ncarbon reduction beyond traditional renewable energy sources. Our Approach to Zero\ntransition strategy details how we intend to help our clients transition to a low-\ncarboneconomy and, as described in our 2022 TCFD Report, we continue to make      \nprogress in deploying our net zero strategy.Key to achieving the transition to a  \nlow-carboneconomy is engaging with our clients. As discussed in our Approach to   \nZero transition strategy, we believe that our targeted financing policies and     \npractices, and the related risk management practices, align with our net zero     \ncommitments. Further, we also believe that our energy, power and related policies,\nas outlined in our ESRP Framework, support our climate goals and promote the      \ntransition to a low-carboneconomy. As set out in our ESRP Framework, there are    \ncertain business activities that have increased investor, client, employee, and   \nregulator scrutiny. These transactions are evaluated in alignment with our        \ncompany\u2019s Board-approved Risk Framework, which outlines our company\u2019s approach to \nrisk management, as are all transaction and client decisions, in the ordinary     \ncourse of business. This process is client-specific, deal-specific, and subject to\ngovernance review. This process considers portfolio-level credit, operational,    \nreputational, and other risks, including climate risk. As part of that process, we\nhave determined not to engage in the following activities based on the appropriate\napplication of our Risk Framework and enhanced due diligence standards:           \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Direct financing of petroleum exploration or production activities in the  \n       Arctic;                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Direct financing of the construction or expansion of new coal-fired power  \n  \u2022    plants\u2014unless those facilities employ technology that is focused on        \n       complete or near elimination of atmospheric carbon emissions; and          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Direct financing of new thermal coal mines or the expansion of existing    \n       mines.                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, as disclosed in our 2022 TCFD Report, as part of our transition      \nstrategy, by 2025 we will phase out all financing (including facilitating capital \nmarkets transactions and advising on mergers and acquisitions) of companies       \nderiving \u226525% of their revenue from thermal coal mining, unless the company has a \npublic commitment to align its business (across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) with  \nthe goals of the Paris Agreement and the transaction would be facilitating the    \ndiversification of the company\u2019s business away from thermal coal. Over the past   \nseveral years, we have reduced exposure to companies focused on coal extraction,  \nwith pure play coal extraction now representing only $42 million, or less than    \n0.01% of our total committed commercial credit exposure across all industries     \nexposure, down more than 94% from $762 million at fiscal year-end2015. In light of\nour disclosures and declared strategy, the issuance of our 2030 Financing Activity\nTargets, and our carefully developed and well-articulated risk management         \nframework, our Board believes that the report requested in Proposal 9, which would\nsubstantially duplicate our existing transition planning, would not be a          \nproductive use of time or effort. Further, as disclosed in our TCFD Report, we    \ncontinue to develop and issue GHG emission reduction targets. We are also         \ntransparent in disclosing these transition-related activities and risks in the    \nESRP Framework and our 2022 TCFD Report. Therefore, our Board believes the report \nrequested by Proposal 9 would be duplicative and unnecessary.                     \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 9).                         \n                                                      \nProposal 10: Shareholder proposal requesting adoption of policy to cease financing\nnew fossil fuel supplies Sada Geuss, c/o Trillium Asset Management, Two Financial \nCenter, 60 South Street, Suite 1100, Boston, MA, 02111, has advised us that they  \nintend to present the resolution below.

Building on our           \nlongstanding support for the Paris Agreement, we have a goal to achieve net zero  \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply\nchain before 2050, and in April 2022, we released our Approach to Zero strategy,  \n(2)which outlines our commitment to helping finance the broader transition to net \nzero GHG emissions and our target setting process. The success of that transition \nwill be dependent on the transformation of critical areas of the global economy,  \nincluding energy, power, transportation, and real estate. As discussed below, in  \nlight of our ongoing efforts to finance the transition to a low-carbonenvironment,\nour environmental and social risk management programs, and our net zero           \ncommitment, our Board believes the business restriction and policy change         \nrequested by the proposal is unnecessary and that its implementation would unduly \nrestrain our ability to pursue our carefully considered and tailored Approach to  \nZero strategy. Under our Approach to Net Zero strategy, we are committed to       \nachieving net zero emissions from our operations, supply chain and financing      \nactivities before 2050, we have taken concrete action in support of that          \ncommitment, and we are transparent about our progress.In April 2021, we agreed to \nparticipate in the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).

The PCAF has developed the Global GHG Accounting\nand Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, providing a consistent         \nmethodology to assess and disclose emissions associated with financing activities.\nIn April 2022, we released Approach to Zero, which outlines our commitment to     \nhelping finance the transition to net zero GHG emissions and details our target   \nsetting methodology, as informed by our PCAF and NZBA commitments. Integral to our\nApproach to Zero strategy are the emission reduction targets for financing        \nactivity in the auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation sectors that we  \nannounced in 2022. In line with our NZBA commitment, we plan to set financing     \nactivity emissions reduction targets for other key high-emitting sectors by April \n2024. As set forth in the NZBA guidelines, we will regularly review our targets so\nthey remain consistent with current climate science. As discussed in detail in our\n2022 Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD) Report, we       \ncontinue to make progress towards achieving our net zero commitment. For more     \ninformation on how we approach climate change-related risk and opportunities and  \nthe progress we have made, please see our 2022 TFCD Report available on our       \nwebsite.

In 2022, we mobilized and      \ndeployed approximately $158 billion in sustainable finance activity, of which     \napproximately $78 billion was for climate and environmental transition. Our multi-\nyear financing commitment provides financial capital, along with significant      \nintellectual capital, to develop solutions to climate change and other            \nenvironmental challenges. It focuses on low-carbonenergy, energy efficiency, and  \nsustainable transportation, in addition to addressing other important areas like  \nwater conservation, land use, and waste. We believe that our financing policies   \nand practices strongly align with our net zero commitments. Further, we also      \nbelieve that our policy positions prohibiting Arctic drilling, prohibiting the    \nconstruction or expansion of coal-fired plants, and prohibiting the financing of  \nnew thermal coal and expansion of existing mines support our climate goals and    \npromote the transition to a low-carboneconomy. A key aspect of our Approach to    \nZero strategy is engagement and partnership with clients across energy, power, and\nother fossil fuel intensive sectors to share our expertise and perspectives,      \ncreate positive and constructive dialogues with key stakeholders, and encourage   \nand influence clients to consider their role in the transition to a low-          \ncarboneconomy.Our company is committed to improving the environment, and this     \ncommitment is integral to our global business model, the work we do with partners,\nand our focus on making our operations more sustainable, managing risks and       \ngoverning our activities. Our work in these areas is also part of how we drive    \nsustainable Responsible Growth. We have a well-considered and pragmatic strategy  \nfor supporting the transition of energy and power systems toward net zero         \nemissions by 2050. As discussed above, our company is dedicated to supporting the \nnet zero transition through our lending, investments, products and services, and  \noperations. A critical part of our strategy is ongoing engagement and partnership \nwith clients across energy, power, and other sectors, including those that are    \nfossil fuel intensive. To accelerate an orderly transition to net zero, we        \ncontinue to support clients who are playing an active role in the energy          \ntransition. By sharing expertise and perspectives through regular engagement with \nkey stakeholders on their transition plans, we are able to deliver traditional    \nproduct solutions and develop new climate-transition specific solutions for low-  \ncarbonenergy solutions to assist clients in their net zero transition. Because our\nclients will need our advice and our expertise across industry sectors to assist  \nthem in navigating the climate transition, we are undertaking an effort to educate\nand prepare relationship managers and bankers with training so they can actively  \nengage with clients on the topic and provide a comprehensive client experience on \nthe path to net zero. A key element of this engagement is helping clients access  \nthe capital they need to affect this transition within their companies.           \nTransitioning entire sectors of the economy before 2050 must be approached with   \nurgency and yet thoughtfully. We acknowledge that some stakeholders desire this   \ntransition to occur much faster than others. We recognize this challenge but      \nstrive for a just transition in every dimension, including balancing the need to  \nsupport traditional, affordable energy sources in the near-term with the          \nrecognition that emissions exacerbate risk in the longer term. We have implemented\na comprehensive environmental and social risk policy framework and mechanisms for \nmanaging environmental and social risks across our enterprise.To provide oversight\nand rigor to these climate-related activities, we have established strong         \ngovernance and control mechanisms. Our Board exercises its climate-related risk   \noversight obligations and ESG oversight. Our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee    \noversees our company\u2019s risks, including climate and ESG risk. Further, our Board\u2019s\nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee (CGESC) oversees our      \nclimate-related and other ESG activities. To further strengthen our oversight of  \nthese issues, we established our Global Responsible Growth Committee (Responsible \nGrowth Committee), which is a management-level committee composed of senior       \nleaders across every line of business and support function. The Responsible Growth\nCommittee reports to our Board\u2019s CGESC, and also reports to our Management Risk   \nCommittee and our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee on matters related to         \nenvironmental and social risk. As part of our focus on these principles, we       \nestablished our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRP Framework)   \n(4)to provide additional clarity and transparency related to how our company      \napproaches environmental and social risks. The ESRP Framework governs our approach\nto climate-related risk management and already limits, and in some cases          \nprohibits, financing of certain fossil fuels (such as new thermal coal mines or   \nexpansions of existing coal mines). The ESRP Framework is aligned with our Board- \napproved Risk Framework, which outlines the company\u2019s approach to risk management \nand each employee\u2019s responsibilities for risk management across the enterprise. As\npart of their duties, the Responsible Growth Committee and Management Risk        \nCommittee review and approve the ESRP Framework at least every two years. Our Risk\nFramework outlines the seven key risk types that we face \u2014 strategic, credit,     \nmarket, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational \u2014and also addresses   \nclimate risk. Increasingly, environmental and social issues impact many of the    \nseven key risk areas, and our risk management program advances the use of climate \nrisk factors across risk types to evaluate risk to climate change. Managing       \nenvironmental and social risks requires coordinated governance, clearly defined   \nroles and responsibilities, and well-developed processes so these risks are       \nidentified, measured, monitored and controlled in a timely manner. As set out in  \nour ESRP Framework, there are certain business activities that have increased     \ninvestor, client, employee, and regulator scrutiny. These transactions are        \nevaluated in alignment with our Risk Framework, as are all transaction and client \ndecisions, in the ordinary course of business. This process is client-specific,   \ndeal-specific, and subject to governance review. This process considers portfolio-\nlevel credit, operational, reputational, and other risks, including climate risk. \n                                                                                  \n  (4)  Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework is available at         \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/assets/pdf/Environmental-and-Social-Risk\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    107  \n                               \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals As part of our commitment to Responsible     \nGrowth, we have not participated in project finance for oil and gas exploration in\nthe Arctic. The ESRP Framework prohibits direct financing of new thermal coal     \nmines or the expansion of existing coal mines. By 2025, we will phase out all     \nfinancing, including facilitating capital markets transactions and advising on    \nmergers and acquisitions, of companies deriving 25% or more of their revenue from \nthermal coal mining, unless the company has a public commitment to align its      \nbusiness (across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) with the goals of the Paris         \nAgreement, and the transaction facilitates the diversification of that client\u2019s   \nbusiness away from thermal coal. Our ESRP Framework also prohibits providing      \nlending or capital markets or advisory services to coal extraction companies      \ninvolved in mountain top removal mining. In addition, any transactions involving  \ncoal extraction are subject to enhanced due diligence, which includes review of   \nevolving market dynamics, specific risks and regulations related to coal          \nextraction and the client\u2019s commitment, capacity and track record on ESG          \nperformance. Over the past several years, we have reduced exposure to companies   \nfocused on coal extraction, with pure play coal extraction representing only $42  \nmillion as of 12/31/2022, or less than 0.01% of our total committed commercial    \ncredit exposure across all industries exposure, down more than 94% from $762      \nmillion at fiscal year-end2015. Our Board believes the business restriction and   \npolicy requested by the proposal is unnecessary in light of our commitment to help\nfinance the transition to net zero emissions, our robust risk management programs \nand policies, and the progress we have made toward achieving our broader net zero \ncommitment.To reiterate, as discussed above, our company is committed to improving\nthe environment, and this commitment is integral to how we approach our global    \nbusiness strategy, work with partners, make our operations more sustainable,      \nsupport our employees, manage risks and govern our activities. Our Board believes \nour company, our shareholders, our community, and society are best served by our  \ncontinued focus on executing our Approach to Zero climate strategy. We are        \ntransparent about our well-considered and pragmatic strategy for supporting the   \ntransition of our energy and power systems toward a low-carbonfuture, and we      \npublicly discuss our strategy in many public disclosures, including our 2022 TCFD \nReport and ESRP Framework. We continue to make significant investments in         \nfinancing the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 through our sustainable    \nfinance commitment and related programs and initiatives. In addition, as described\nabove, we take a proactive approach to identifying and managing risks, which      \nincludes an ongoing and rigorous process for identifying the issues that are most \nsignificant to our company, and we have implemented well-considered risk oversight\nand management frameworks and policies with respect to environmental and social   \nrisks. Our management, bankers and risk managers are well-positioned to analyze   \nour overall exposures as well as individual transactions and react to the nuances \nand circumstances presented in each transaction, with overriding goals of         \nachieving the net zero goals we have described above. Our Board is in the best    \nposition to provide oversight of our ESG commitments and progress toward achieving\nthem. Our Board believes that the policy change requested by the proposal is      \nunnecessary and would unduly restrict our company\u2019s ability to implement our      \nApproach to Zero climate strategy, which we believe provides the most effective   \npath for our company to address climate change and achieve our net zero           \ncommitments.                                                                      \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 10).                        \n                                                      \nProposal 11: Shareholder proposal requesting a racial equity audit The SOC        \nInvestment Group, 1900 L Street NW. Suite 900, Washington, DC 20036, advised us   \nthat it intends to present the resolution below. The proponent confirmed that it  \nis the beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of the company\u2019s common\nstock, but did not provide the number of shares owned. RESOLVED that shareholders \nof Bank of America Corporation (\u201cBofA\u201d) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a  \nthird-party racial equity audit analyzing BofA\u2019s adverse impacts on nonwhite      \nstakeholders and communities of color, above and beyond legal and regulatory      \nmatters. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and customers should be\nconsidered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the    \naudit, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary       \ninformation, should be publicly disclosed on the bank\u2019s website. SUPPORTING       \nSTATEMENT Recently, the racial justice movement together with the disproportionate\nimpacts of the COVID-19pandemic on communities of color have focused the public\u2019s \nand policy makers\u2019 attention on racial equity issues. Following the June 2020     \nprotests related to George Floyd\u2019s murder, BofA announced it would commit $1      \nbillion to racial equity initiatives with an additional $250 million in March 2021\n\u201cto address long-standing issues of inclusion and racial inequality\u2026\u201d BofA has a  \nconflicted history when it comes to racial equity issues. In 2018, the Treasury   \nDepartment\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found that the bank offered\ndisproportionately fewer home loans to minorities than to white applicants in     \nPhiladelphia. The bank also closed 29.1% of branches in majority-Black communities\ncompared to 18.4% in non-majorityBlack areas from 2010-2018, despite the important\nrole that branches play in supporting small businesses. From an employment        \nperspective, as of 2021, executive/senior level officials and managers comprised  \nonly 5.7% of Black employees and 5.3% of Hispanic employees although 49% of its   \nU.S. workforce are people of color.                                               \n                          \n  108    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                          \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals The bank has specified areas it plans to     \nfocus on, including funding affordable housing through minority depository        \ninstitutions, yet its racial equity commitment does not address concerns related  \nto its own financial products. Further, in 2021 the bank provided $15 billion in  \naffordable home lending outside of its racial equity commitment, but this         \nearmarked amount is a fraction of the bank\u2019s own residential mortgage lending     \nportfolio, valued at approximately $221 billion in 2021. The bank has yet to      \ndisclose how it plans to evaluate the racial impact of its direct lending as part \nof its strategy to address racial inequality. Despite BofA\u2019s initiatives, the bank\nhas faced well publicized allegations of racial profiling at their branches. In   \n2022, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director, Ryan Coogler, was handcuffed and detained by      \npolice as a suspected bank robber when he attempted to withdraw money from his    \naccount; BofA later apologized. That same week, a TikTok showing an instance of   \n\u201cbanking while black\u201d went viral after a teller refused to validate a Black       \ncustomer\u2019s check without providing any reason. A third-party racial equity audit  \nwould ensure that BofA\u2019s resources are being allocated appropriately and          \neffectively.

We regularly report on our activities, \nseek input from our shareholders about the types of information that would be     \nuseful to them in assessing our activities, review that input with our Board and  \nits committees, and provide additional disclosures in response so that we are     \naccountable for our progress. We continue this cycle of work to drive concrete    \nactions and further progress. This is Responsible Growth. We have already         \ncommitted to undertake a Responsible Growth Assessment\u2014an independent third-party \nassessment of our $1.25 billion racial equality and economic opportunity          \ncommitment and of our $15 billion Community Homeownership Commitment \u00ae to         \nhomebuyers in low- to moderate-income communities to assess the fulfillment of our\ncommitments in delivering Responsible Growth.In 2022, we committed to conducting a\nthird-party led program assessment, in consultation with our Board, institutional \nshareholders, and other stakeholder groups, including our National Community      \nAdvisory Council described below, to assess our $1.25 billion commitment to       \nadvance racial equality and economic opportunity and our $15 billion Community    \nHomeownership Commitment \u00aeto homebuyers in low- to moderate-income communities in \ndelivering Responsible Growth. Specifically, this assessment will analyze the     \nextent to which our activities have met these commitments. These commitments were \nmade under initiatives to promote Responsible Growth, including the tenets of \u201cWe \nmust grow in a sustainable manner\u201d and \u201cWe must grow within our risk framework.\u201d  \nWe plan to complete this assessment and issue a report on the results before our  \n2024 annual shareholders meeting. Our Board believes this targeted assessment, in \ntandem with the cycle of transparency and accountability described above and      \nbelow, will provide additional relevant information to our shareholders,          \nemployees, communities, and stakeholders, and address the Proposal\u2019s request.     \nThrough our commitment and actions, our company has a demonstrated longstanding   \nrecord of promoting equality, diversity and inclusion, and advancing economic     \nopportunity, within our company and in our communities, all in pursuit of         \nResponsible Growth that is sustainable.We are very intentional in taking actions  \nto make Responsible Growth sustainable, and these strategies require action inside\nand outside our company. We have a demonstrable sustained record of promoting     \nequality, diversity and inclusion, and advancing economic opportunity both inside \nour company and with external stakeholders.                                       \n                                                                                  \n       Commitment to being a Great Place to Work. We value and promote equality,  \n       diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business and at every       \n       level of our organization. As described in our Human Capital Management    \n       Update included in our 2022 Annual Report to shareholders,(1) we have      \n       implemented a wide range of programs and benefits to support our           \n       teammates and their families, in keeping with our commitment to invest in  \n       the people who serve our clients, and people who live and work in the      \n       communities we serve across the U.S. and around the world. We recognize    \n       and reward teammate performance by being an industry leader in             \n       establishing an internal minimum rate of pay above all mandated minimums   \n  \u2022    for our U.S. hourly employees (with plans to increase our minimum hourly   \n       wage to $25 by 2025), recognizing our teammates with Sharing Success       \n       compensation awards (nearly all of which are in the form of our common     \n       stock), and supporting employees and their families through various        \n       benefits programs, such as complimentary lunch, electric vehicle           \n       reimbursements, and our new sabbatical program for long-tenured            \n       employees. We reinforce our commitment to diversity and expand our impact  \n       by drawing input and best practices from other organizations focused on    \n       advancing and driving inclusion in the workplace, and through our          \n       employee networks worldwide that provide opportunities for our teammates   \n       to develop leadership skills, build ties with local communities, and       \n       advance diversity recruitment.                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  For over 20 years, our Global Diversity &           \n  Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO and staffed   \n  by senior executives from every area of the         \n  company, has promoted diversity goal setting,       \n  which is embedded in our performance management     \n  system and occurs at all levels of the enterprise.  \n  Our company seeks to build a diverse pipeline of    \n  candidates for positions at all levels of the       \n  company, including leadership positions. We         \n  routinely disclose our company\u2019s workforce          \n  diversity metrics, including publishing our EEO-1   \n  data and our hiring and retention/turnover rates    \n  for female employees globally and for people of     \n  color, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino  \n  employees in the U.S., in order to publicly hold    \n  ourselves accountable and to confirm whether we     \n  are delivering on our commitment to increase        \n  diverse representation across the company wherever  \n  possible. Our commitment has resulted in            \n  improvements in key workforce diversity metrics.    \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n       Commitment to sharing our success. Our company believes that we have an    \n       important role to play in helping communities move forward. This           \n       understanding is core to our company\u2019s commitment to sustainable           \n       Responsible Growth and to sharing our success with the people and          \n       communities we serve. As part of that commitment, our company knows that   \n       it must take action to combat issues of racial and economic inequality.    \n       In June 2020 and further updated in March 2021, our company announced a    \n       new commitment to invest $1.25\u00a0billion over five years to advance racial   \n       equality and economic opportunity, expanding and building on work we\u2019ve    \n       had underway for many years. Our actions will help address critical        \n  \u2022    issues and fill long-term gaps, including skills and job readiness,        \n       medical capacity and access, small business support, and affordable        \n       housing. This initiative is being implemented across our lines of          \n       business and in the markets in which we operate, including through our     \n       focus on sustainable finance and our Supplier Diversity\u00a0& Responsible      \n       Sourcing Program, under which we spent $2 billion in 2022 with diverse     \n       suppliers. We have also increased our Bank of America Community            \n       Homeownership Commitment\u00ae to $15\u00a0billion through 2025 with a goal to help  \n       60,000 low- to moderate-income individuals and families to purchase a      \n       home.

It also recognized our work to  \neliminate barriers for hiring, offer sustainable financing products, and          \nprioritize board diversity and independence. We have ongoing relationships with   \nindependent third parties , including our NCAC, that provide counsel and input on \nour equality, diversity and inclusion commitments and actions, including those    \nthat impact communities and stakeholders of color, and who provide accountability \nthrough review of our work. In addition to conducting an independent Responsible  \nGrowth Assessment, we consult with independent experts to guide, inform, and      \ncounsel our commitment and actions to make our company a great place to work and  \nto share success with our stakeholders. There are complex and multifaceted        \nconsiderations in promoting racial equality and economic opportunity, and we      \nreadily acknowledge we do not have all the answers. We seek the advice of, and    \nlisten to, experts offering diverse perspectives. We use our voice and our        \npartnerships to convene and engage in important assessments that identify and     \npromote meaningful progress on impactful aspects of our operations. Because we are\nan active participant in each local community in which we operate, we understand  \nits economy, culture, strengths, and challenges. This engagement enables us to    \ndeliver effective solutions and service by matching the right resources to each   \ncommunity\u2019s individual needs. And these efforts are informed by input received    \nfrom community leaders, consumer advocates, and other local stakeholders. For     \nexample, our NCAC is a diverse group of senior leaders from social justice,       \nconsumer advocacy, community development, environment organizations, and policy   \ninstitutes that meet several times a year\u2014including with our Board Chair and Lead \nIndependent Director\u2014to provide a range of external perspectives on our business  \npolicies, practices, and products. NCAC members\u2019 depth of knowledge on the needs  \nof lower income individuals contributed to our developing solutions and resources \nto help our clients manage their finances responsibly, including SafeBalance      \nBanking \u00ae, (2)Community Affordable Loan Solution \u2122, Better Money Habits \u00ae,        \n(3)Balance Assist \u2122, (4)and the sweeping changes to our overdraft policies        \nannounced in January 2022 to eliminate non-sufficientfunds fees and reducing      \noverdraft fees to empower clients to create long-term financial wellness. We have \nengaged with investors to understand the types of information useful to them in   \nassessing risks related to our impacts on equality, diversity and inclusion and   \neconomic opportunity.At our 2021 annual shareholders meeting, over 73% of our     \nshareholders voted against a similar proposal. In conversations with our          \ninstitutional investors, they have voiced their preference for us to examine our  \ncommitments in the overall context of our risk management and strategy, and report\non that assessment. We believe our approach will enable our investors to assess   \nthe progress of our commitments within the context of our overall operational     \nfocus on Responsible Growth. Since that vote, management also continued to learn  \nand receive input about racial equity audits, including: research about the       \ncomponents and scope of a racial equity audit; engaging with peers and other      \ncompanies that have conducted or agreed to conduct racial equity audits; meeting  \nwith key stakeholders that have submitted such shareholder proposals, including   \nthe Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the New York State Comptroller,\nand SOC Investment Group; and meeting with key stakeholders that have published   \nresearch about racial equity audits, such as the Ford Foundation. We also         \ndiscussed racial equity audits with our Board and NCAC. During our shareholder    \nengagements since late 2021, we sought further perspectives about our ongoing     \nefforts to advance equality, diversity and inclusion and economic opportunity,    \nabout racial equity audits more broadly, and specifically discussed the           \nadvisability of such audits at our company. Shareholders shared an overall belief \nthat our company does not currently face issues of specific concern that an audit,\nlike the one requested by the Proposal, would help address. A minority of         \nshareholders expressed a belief that an audit might be useful as a risk management\ntool or to identify \u201cblind-spots\u201d in our current practices. However, overall, our \nshareholders were supportive of our approach of undertaking targeted reviews of   \nour activities, transparency in our progress, and how our programs align with     \nResponsible Growth, including the pillars to grow in a sustainable manner and     \nwithin our risk framework. In our shareholder engagements with investors in the   \nsecond half of 2022, in which we met with holders of approximately 25% of our     \noutstanding common stock, the investors rarely discussed our company undertaking a\nracial equity audit. In the few instances where it was a topic of discussion, the \ninvestors expressed satisfaction with our activity and commitments, and           \ntransparency in reporting. Some investors expressed that any review of the        \ncompany\u2019s racial equality and economic opportunity commitments should examine such\ncommitments in the overall context of our strategy and our risk management so that\nthe review may provide insights into the potential impact and risks of these      \ncommitments on the value of their ownership of our common stock. Our shareholders,\nemployees, customers, and communities are well served by our continuous and       \nholistic pursuit of Responsible Growth that includes continued engagement and     \nprogress on equality, diversity and inclusion, and economic opportunity, including\nour ongoing Responsible Growth Assessment.Protecting and promoting equality,      \ndiversity and inclusion, and economic opportunity, both inside our company with   \nemployees and outside our company in our communities, are critical components of  \nResponsible Growth. We recognize that addressing these issues will require        \ncontinuing and iterative action. By continuing to pursue sustainable Responsible  \nGrowth that requires a focus on sharing our success, being a great place to work  \nfor our teammates, and driving operational excellence to invest in our employees  \nand our communities, we believe we already are on the right path in our journey   \nfor continued improvement. Our ongoing efforts in these areas, including our      \nResponsible Growth Assessment,our continuous engagement with shareholders,        \nemployees, and external experts and stakeholders                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (2)  Bank of America Advantage SafeBalance Banking\u00ae is an account that helps    \n       prevent overdraft fees.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (3)  Better Money Habits\u00ae is free financial education with resources,           \n       guidance, and tools on ways to save, plan and manage money.                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (4)  Balance Assist\u2122 is a low-cost solution for clients to manage their         \n       short-term liquidity needs.                                                \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    111  \n                               \nProposals 6-11:Shareholder proposals representing a wide range of perspectives,   \nand our Board\u2019s oversight and leadership of our efforts, demonstrate our          \ncommitment to understanding and improving our company\u2019s impacts on all            \nstakeholders, including communities and stakeholders of color.

Our Bylaws provide that a nominee for      \n       director in an uncontested election will be elected to our Board if the    \n       votes cast for the nominee\u2019s election exceed the votes cast against his    \n       or her election. Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not      \n       treated as votes cast and are not counted for purposes of determining the  \n  \u2022    election of directors. If a nominee does not receive the required votes    \n       for election at our annual meeting, our Board, with the assistance of our  \n       Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, will consider     \n       whether to accept the director\u2019s offer of resignation, which is required   \n       to be tendered under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Board will   \n       publicly disclose its decision regarding the resignation and the basis     \n       for its decision within 90 days after election results are certified.      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Other proposals. Approval of Proposals 2 and 4 through 11 requires the     \n       votes cast in favor of each such proposal to exceed the votes cast         \n       against the proposal. For Proposal 3, there are four choices for           \n       shareholders: each year; every two years; every three years; and abstain.  \n       The choice that receives the majority of votes cast will be considered     \n  \u2022    approved. As an advisory vote, our Board will consider the frequency that  \n       receives the most votes in determining whether to have an advisory \u201cSay    \n       on Pay\u201d vote each year, every two years, or every three years.             \n       Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not treated as votes      \n       cast and are not counted in determining the outcome of any of these        \n       proposals.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  114    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                          \nVoting and other information What other information do I need to know?

Establishment, Duration and Purpose 1.1\nEstablishment and Duration of the Plan. The Company established this Plan,        \noriginally known as the \u201cBank of America Corporation Key Associate Stock Plan,\u201d   \neffective as of January 1, 2003, and the Plan as originally established was       \napproved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Plan, subsequently known as the \u201cBank \nof America Key Employee Equity Plan\u201d and now known as the \u201cBank of America        \nCorporation Equity Plan\u201d was subsequently amended or amended and restated on      \nseveral occasions, most recently with an amendment approved by the Company\u2019s      \nstockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 20, 2021. The Plan is \nhereby being further amended and restated, subject to and effective upon the      \napproval of the Company\u2019s stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on   \nApril 25, 2023. The purposes of amending and restating the Plan are to (a)        \nauthorize additional Shares for Awards under the Plan, (b) extend the Plan\u2019s term,\n(c) require that dividends or dividend equivalents credited with respect to Awards\nof Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units may not become payable unless and   \nuntil vesting conditions for the Award are satisfied, and (d) allow Shares        \nwithheld by the Company to satisfy tax withholding requirements with respect to   \ntaxable events arising as a result of the Plan with respect to Awards of          \nRestricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to again be available under the number \nof shares available for future grant under the Plan.

The Company believes that the compensation of its Employees  \nshould be linked to the Company\u2019s business performance in order to enhance the    \nlong-term success and value of the Company. The Plan serves this compensation     \nphilosophy by providing a source of equity-based Awards for Employees that are    \nintended to further motivate Employees to increase the value of the Company\u2019s     \ncommon stock, thereby aligning the interests of the Employees with those of the   \nCompany\u2019s stockholders while maintaining an appropriate balance between risk and  \nreward. The Plan also provides the Company with a means to attract, recruit and   \nretain Employees who will create sustainable results consistent with the Company\u2019s\nrisk management policies and strategic plan for the long-term benefit of the      \nCompany\u2019s stockholders. The Plan also enables the Company to attract and retain   \npersons of exceptional ability to serve as Non-EmployeeDirectors and to further   \nalign the interests of Non-EmployeeDirectors and stockholders in enhancing the    \nvalue of the Company\u2019s Shares.

Upon exercise of an SAR, a      \nParticipant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount    \ndetermined by multiplying: (a) The difference between the Fair Market Value of a  \nShare on the date of exercise over the grant price; by (b) The number of Shares   \nwith respect to which the SAR is exercised.

Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the   \nCommittee, shall be included in the Award Agreement entered into with             \nParticipants, need not be uniform among all SARs issued pursuant to the Plan, and \nmay reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment. In   \nthat regard, if an Award Agreement permits exercise of an SAR following the death \nof the Participant, the Award Agreement shall provide that such SAR shall be      \nexercisable to the extent provided therein by any person that may be empowered to \ndo so under the Participant\u2019s will, or if the Participant shall fail to make a    \ntestamentary disposition of the SAR or shall have died intestate, by the          \nParticipant\u2019s executor or other legal representative. 7.8 Nontransferability of   \nSARs. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant\u2019s Award Agreement, no SAR     \ngranted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise  \nalienated or hypothecated (including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without   \nlimiting the foregoing restrictions, third-party financial institutions), other   \nthan by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as       \notherwise provided in a Participant\u2019s Award Agreement, all SARs granted to a      \nParticipant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by\nsuch Participant.

During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding  \nShares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may receive regular cash dividends   \npaid with respect to the underlying Shares while the Restricted Stock is held by  \nthe Company. The Committee, in its discretion, may also grant dividend equivalents\nrights with respect to earned but unpaid Restricted Stock Units as evidenced by   \nthe applicable Award Agreement. Dividends or dividend equivalents may be accrued  \nas cash or reinvested in additional Shares or other securities of the Company at a\nprice per unit equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date that such    \ndividend was paid to stockholders, as determined in the sole discretion of the    \nCommittee. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in no event will \na dividend or dividend equivalent become payable with respect to an Award that    \nbecomes vested (i) based on the satisfaction of performance criteria before the   \ndate, and only to the extent, that such performance criteria are satisfied, or    \n(ii) based on continued service with the Company before the applicable vesting    \ndate. 8.8 Termination of Employment.Each Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit\nAward Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the\nright to receive unvested Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock Units following   \ntermination of the Participant\u2019s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.\nSuch provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall\nbe included in the Award Agreement entered into with Participants, need not be    \nuniform among all Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units issued     \npursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for       \ntermination of employment. Article 9. Performance Measures 9.1 Performance        \nConditions.The right of a Participant to exercise or receive a grant or settlement\nof any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance          \nconditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such       \nbusiness criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in \nestablishing any such performance conditions.                                     \n                               \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    B-9  \n                               \nAppendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan 9.2      \nPerformance Goals Generally.The performance goals for Performance Awards shall    \nconsist of one or more business or other criteria and a targeted level or levels  \nof performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the         \nCommittee consistent with this Section 9.2. The Committee may determine that such \nPerformance Awards shall be granted, exercised and/or settled upon achievement of \nany one performance goal or that two or more of the performance goals must be     \nachieved as a condition to grant, exercise, and/or settlement of such Performance \nAwards. Performance goals may, in the discretion of the Committee, be established \non a Company-wide basis, or with respect to one or more business units, divisions,\nsubsidiaries, or business segments, as applicable. Performance goals may be       \nabsolute or relative (to the performance of one or more comparable companies or   \nindices). The Committee may determine the extent to which measurement of          \nperformance goals may exclude the impact of charges for restructuring,            \ndiscontinued operations, extraordinary items, debt redemption or retirement, asset\nwrite downs, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, acquisitions or        \ndivestitures, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other unusual non-           \nrecurringitems, and the cumulative effects of tax or accounting changes (each as  \ndefined by generally accepted accounting principles and as identified in the      \nCompany\u2019s financial statements or other SEC filings). Performance goals may differ\nfor Performance Awards granted to any one Participant or to different             \nParticipants. 9.3 Business Criteria.For purposes of Performance Awards, the       \nCommittee may select any business criteria for the Company, on a consolidated     \nbasis, and/or specified subsidiaries or business units of the Company, including  \nany of the following:                                                             \n                   \n  (i)  cash flow;  \n                   \n                             \n  (ii)  earnings per share;  \n                             \n                                             \n  (iii)  income or other earnings measures;  \n                                             \n                                                                    \n  (iv)  return on equity, capital, assets, revenue or investments;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                            \n  (v)  total stockholder return or other stock price performance measures;  \n                                                                            \n                                  \n  (vi)  stockholder value added;  \n                                  \n                   \n  (vii)  revenue;  \n                   \n                          \n  (viii)  profit margin;  \n                          \n                            \n  (ix)  efficiency ratios;  \n                            \n                               \n  (x)  customer satisfaction;  \n                               \n                       \n  (xi)  productivity;  \n                       \n                    \n  (xii)  expenses;  \n                    \n                                                                                  \n  (xiii)  balance sheet metrics, including capital ratios, liquidity measures     \n          and book value;                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  (xiv)  credit quality;  \n                          \n                                   \n  (xv)  strategic initiatives; or  \n                                   \n                                                                                  \n         implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with   \n  (xvi)  respect to recruitment or retention of personnel or employee             \n         satisfaction.                                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe business criteria listed above shall include any derivations of such business \ncriteria (e.g., income shall include pre-taxincome, net income, operating income, \netc.). 9.4. Written Determinations.All determinations by the Committee as to the  \nestablishment of performance goals, the amount of any potential individual        \nPerformance Awards and the achievement of performance goals relating to           \nPerformance Awards, shall be made in writing. The Committee may delegate any      \nresponsibility relating to such Performance Awards. Article 10. Beneficiary       \nDesignation Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, each Participant  \nunder the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who \nmay be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is  \nto be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of    \nsuch benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the    \nsame Participant, shall be in a form and pursuant to such procedures as may be    \nprescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the           \nParticipant in writing with the Company during the Participant\u2019s lifetime. In the \nabsence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant\u2019s   \ndeath shall be paid to the Participant\u2019s estate.                                  \n                           \n  B-10    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \nAppendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan Article  \n11. Deferrals The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such Participant\u2019s  \nreceipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be  \ndue to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR or the lapse\nor waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock    \nUnits, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code (if applicable). If any\nsuch deferral election is required or permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole \ndiscretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals. Article 12.\nRights of Employees 12.1 Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or  \nlimit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant\u2019s          \nemployment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in  \nthe employ of the Company. For purposes of this Plan, a transfer of a             \nParticipant\u2019s employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or between         \nSubsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment. Upon such a  \ntransfer, the Committee may make such adjustments to outstanding Awards as it     \ndeems appropriate to reflect the changed reporting relationships. 12.2            \nParticipation. No Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award\nunder this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future  \nAward or a future Award in any specified amount. Article 13. Change in Control    \n13.1 Treatment of Outstanding Awards.Unless otherwise specifically prohibited     \nunder applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing           \ngovernmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee may, in its \nsole discretion, at the time an Award is made hereunder or at any time prior to,  \ncoincident with or after the time of a Change in Control take any one or more of  \nthe following actions which shall apply only upon the occurrence of a Change in   \nControl or, if later, upon the action being taken: (a) provide for the            \nacceleration of any time periods, or the waiver of any other conditions, relating \nto the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an Award so that any Award to\na Participant whose employment has been terminated as a result of a Change in     \nControl may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a date \nfixed by the Committee, and in connection therewith the Committee may (i) provide \nfor an extended period to exercise Options (not to exceed the original Option     \nterm) and (ii) determine the level of attainment of any applicable performance    \ngoals; (b) provide for the purchase of any Awards from a Participant whose        \nemployment has been terminated as a result of a Change in Control, upon the       \nParticipant\u2019s request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have  \nbeen obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such  \nAward been currently exercisable or payable; or (c) cause the Awards then         \noutstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving  \ncorporation in such Change in Control. For purposes of sub-paragraphs(a) and (b)  \nabove, any Participant whose employment is either (i) terminated by the Company   \nother than for \u201ccause,\u201d or (ii) terminated by the Participant for \u201cgood reason\u201d   \n(each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), in either case upon, or on or\nprior to the second anniversary of, a Change in Control, shall be deemed to have  \nbeen terminated as a result of the Change in Control. 13.2 Limitation on Change-  \nin-ControlBenefits. It is the intention of the Company and the Participants to    \nreduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder if the     \naggregate Net After Tax Receipts (as defined below) to the Participant would      \nthereby be increased, as a result of the application of the excise tax provisions \nof Section 4999 of the Code. Accordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary   \nnotwithstanding, in the event that the certified public accountants regularly     \nemployed by the Company immediately prior to any \u201cchange\u201d described below (the    \n\u201cAccounting Firm\u201d) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below)\nwould subject the Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall     \ndetermine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a \u201cReduced \nAmount\u201d (as defined below). If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a     \nReduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount in \naccordance with the provisions of Section 13.2(b) below. (a) For purposes of this \nSection 13.2(a): (i) A \u201cPayment\u201d shall mean any payment or distribution in the    \nnature of compensation to or for the benefit of a Participant who is a            \n\u201cdisqualified individual\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and   \nwhich is contingent on a \u201cchange\u201d described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the    \nCode with respect to the Company, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or\notherwise; (ii) \u201cPlan Payment\u201d shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to   \nthis Plan (disregarding this Section 13.2); (iii) \u201cNet After Tax Receipt\u201d shall   \nmean the Present Value of a Payment, net of all taxes imposed on the Participant  \nwith respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code, determined by applying\nthe highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which applied to the        \nParticipant\u2019s Federal taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year;  \n                                \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    B-11  \n                                \nAppendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan (iv)     \n\u201cPresent Value\u201d shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section       \n280G(d)(4) of the Code; and (v) \u201cReduced Amount\u201d shall mean the smallest aggregate\namount of Payments which (A) is less than the sum of all Payments and (B) results \nin aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are equal to or greater than the Net    \nAfter Tax Receipts which would result if all Payments were paid to or for the     \nbenefit of the Participant. (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate  \nPayments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Committee shall promptly    \ngive the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation \nthereof. The Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments, by first reducing or \neliminating the portion of the Payments which are not payable in cash and then by \nreducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning    \nwith payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the      \ndetermination, all as determined by the Accounting Firm. All determinations made  \nby the Accounting Firm under this Section 13.2 shall be binding upon the Company  \nand the Participant and shall be made within sixty (60) days immediately following\nthe event constituting the \u201cchange\u201d referred to above. As promptly as practicable \nfollowing such determination, the Company shall pay to or distribute for the      \nbenefit of the Participant such Payments as are then due to the Participant under \nthis Plan. (c) At the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm    \nhereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the  \nCompany to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan which      \nshould not have been so paid or distributed (\u201cOverpayment\u201d) or that additional    \namounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the \nbenefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or       \ndistributed (\u201cUnderpayment\u201d), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the\nReduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based either upon\nthe assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company \nor the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of   \nsuccess or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that  \nan Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the     \nCompany to or for the benefit of the Participant shall be treated for all purposes\nas a loan ab initio to the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the   \nCompany together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in     \nSection 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be     \ndeemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Participant to the \nCompany if and to the extent (i) such deemed loan and payment would not either    \nreduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and  \nSection 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes or (ii) the           \nParticipant is subject to the prohibition on personal loans under Section 402 of  \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon \ncontrolling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an          \nUnderpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the    \nCompany to or for the benefit of the Participant together with interest at the    \napplicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 13.3      \nTermination, Amendment, and Modifications of Change-in-ControlProvisions.         \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement provision,\nthe provisions of this Article 13 may not be terminated, amended, or modified on  \nor after the date of a Change in Control to affect adversely any Award theretofore\ngranted under the Plan without the prior written consent of the Participant with  \nrespect to said Participant\u2019s outstanding Awards; provided, however, the Board of \nDirectors, upon recommendation of the Committee, may terminate, amend, or modify  \nthis Article 13 at any time and from time to time prior to the date of a Change in\nControl. Article 14. Amendment, Modification, and Termination 14.1 Amendment,     \nModification, and Termination. The Board may at any time and from time to time,   \nalter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part; provided,        \nhowever, that an amendment to the Plan may be conditioned on the approval of the  \nstockholders of the Company if and to the extent the Board determines that        \nstockholder approval is necessary or appropriate. 14.2 Awards Previously Granted. \nNo termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in  \nany material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written \nconsent of the Participant holding such Award. 14.3 No Repricing. Notwithstanding \nany provision herein to the contrary, the repricing of Options or SARs is         \nprohibited without prior approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders. For this purpose,\na \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the following (or any other action that has the same   \neffect as any of the following): (A) changing the terms of an Option or SAR to    \nlower its Option Price or grant price; (B) any other action that is treated as a  \n\u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting principles; and (C) repurchasing  \nfor cash or canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its Option Price or grant   \nprice is greater than the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange  \nfor another Award, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with \na change in capitalization or similar change under Section 4.7 above. Such        \ncancellation and exchange would be considered a \u201crepricing\u201d regardless of whether \nit is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting principles and \nregardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Participant. Article 15. \nWithholding 15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right  \nto deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount\nsufficient to satisfy Federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the\nParticipant\u2019s FICA or other applicable social tax obligation) required by law to  \nbe withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan.   \n                           \n  B-12    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \nAppendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan 15.2     \nShare Withholding. The Company may cause any tax withholding obligation described \nin Section 15.1 to be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares having a Fair   \nMarket Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the required tax    \nwithholding imposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates). In\nthe alternative, the Company may permit Participants to elect to satisfy the tax  \nwithholding obligation, in whole or in part, by either (a) having the Company     \nwithhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined\nequal to the required tax withholding imposed on the transaction (not to exceed   \nmaximum statutory rates) or (b) tendering previously acquired Shares having an    \naggregate Fair Market Value equal to the required tax withholding imposed on the  \ntransaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates). All such elections shall be  \nirrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to  \nany restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems \nappropriate. Article 16. Indemnification Provisions for the indemnification of    \nofficers and directors of the Company in connection with the administration of the\nPlan shall be as set forth in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and      \nBylaws as in effect from time to time. Article 17. Successors All obligations of  \nthe Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be      \nbinding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor  \nis the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or         \notherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the       \nCompany. Article 18. Legal Construction 18.1 Gender and Number. Except where      \notherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall     \ninclude the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall\ninclude the plural. 18.2 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan     \nshall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity     \nshall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed \nand enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 18.3   \nRequirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the  \nPlan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such \napprovals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be \nrequired. 18.4 Securities Law Compliance. With respect to Insiders, transactions  \nunder this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule     \n16b-3or its successors under the Exchange Act. To the extent any provision of the \nplan or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and   \nvoid, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee. 18.5  \nNo Conflict. Unless otherwise provided for by an Award Agreement, in the event of \nany conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of an Award Agreement,   \nthe terms of the Plan shall control. 18.6 Governing Law. To the extent not        \npreempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be        \nconstrued in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.   \n18.7 Compliance With Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to comply with Code  \nSection 409A, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan \nto the contrary, the Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered         \nconsistent with this intent. In that regard, and notwithstanding any provision of \nthe Plan to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to amend the Plan or any \nAward granted under the Plan, by action of the Committee, without the consent of  \nany affected Participant, to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate for       \npurposes of maintaining compliance with Code Section 409A. Article 19. Non-       \nEmployeeDirectors 19.1 Restricted Stock Awards. Subject to the terms and          \nprovisions of the Plan, the Board, at any time and from time to time, may grant   \nShares of Restricted Stock to Non-EmployeeDirectors in such amounts as the Board  \nshall determine. Notwithstanding the definition of \u201cParticipant\u201d provided in      \nArticle 2 above, upon receipt of a grant of Shares of Restricted Stock, a Non-    \nEmployeeDirector shall be considered a Participant in the Plan. Each grant of     \nShares of Restricted Stock to a Non-EmployeeDirector shall be evidenced by an     \nAward Agreement that shall specify the Period or Periods of Restriction, the      \nnumber of Shares of Restricted Stock granted, and such other provisions as the    \nBoard shall determine.                                                            \n                                \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT    B-13  \n                                \nAppendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan 19.2     \nAdministration. The Board shall be responsible for administering any grants of    \nRestricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors and shall have all of the powers       \nnecessary to enable it to properly carry out its duties hereunder. Not in         \nlimitation of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power to construe and       \ninterpret the Plan and to determine all questions that shall arise thereunder with\nrespect to grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors. The Board shall  \nhave such other and further specified duties, powers, authority and discretion as \nare elsewhere in the Plan either expressly or by necessary implication conferred  \nupon it. The Board may appoint such agents as it may deem necessary for the       \neffective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers  \nand duties as the Board may deem expedient or appropriate that are not            \ninconsistent with the intent of the Plan and this Article 19. The decision of the \nBoard upon all matters within the scope of authority shall be final and conclusive\non all persons, except to the extent otherwise provided by law. 19.3 Vesting.     \nNotwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, Shares of Restricted   \nStock granted to Non-EmployeeDirectors shall not become vested until the first    \nanniversary of the applicable date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of the next \nannual meeting of the stockholders of the Company) (the \u201c Non-EmployeeDirector    \nVesting Date\u201d), provided that if the Non-EmployeeDirector Vesting Date occurs less\nthan 50 weeks after the applicable date of grant, it shall count against the 5%   \nexception pool to the minimum vesting requirements set forth in Section 3.4. If   \nthe Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector before the Non-\nEmployee Director Vesting Date due to the Non-EmployeeDirector\u2019s death, or if     \nthere is a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date, then the Shares shall     \nbecome fully vested as of the date of such death or Change in Control, as         \napplicable. If the Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector \nat any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of the Vesting Date\nor a Change in Control, then the Shares shall become vested pro rata (based on the\nnumber of days between the grant date of the Shares of Restricted Stock, or in the\ncase of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a newly appointed Non-              \nEmployeeDirector, the date of commencement of services, and the date of cessation \nof services divided by (a) 365 days for grants made at an annual stockholders     \nmeeting or (b) the number of days from the date of commencement of services until \nthe next annual stockholders meeting for grants made to a newly appointed Non-    \nEmployeeDirector), and to the extent the Shares are not thereby vested they shall \nbe forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services. A Non-EmployeeDirector \nmay not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Shares of Restricted Stock     \nuntil they become vested; however, the Non-EmployeeDirector shall have the right  \nto receive dividends with respect to the Shares, subject to the terms and         \nconditions of Section 8.7, and to vote the Shares prior to vesting. If a Non-     \nEmployeeDirector has elected to defer any Shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to  \nthe Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (or any other similar plan \nin which the Non-EmployeeDirector participates, including any successor or        \nreplacement plan) (a \u201c Deferral Plan\u201d), then (i) such Shares shall not be issued  \nunder this Plan, (ii) the Non-EmployeeDirector shall be credited with \u201cStock      \nUnits\u201d to be paid in cash when and as provided for under the Deferral Plan, and   \n(iii) the vesting provisions set forth above shall apply to any such Shares that  \nare deferred as Stock Units under the Deferral Plan. 19.4 No Other Awards. For    \npurposes of clarity, Non-EmployeeDirectors may not receive any other form of Award\ndescribed in this Plan, other than grants of Shares of Restricted Stock.          \n                           \n  B-14    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \nBANK OF AMERICA Vote to make a difference Every vote counts.
