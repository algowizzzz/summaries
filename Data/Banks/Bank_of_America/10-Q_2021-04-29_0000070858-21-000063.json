While\nthe temporary relief\nautomatically applied to the\nCorporation, the\nCorporation\u2019s lead\ndepository institution, Bank\nof America, N.A., did not\nopt to take advantage of the\nSLR relief offered by the\nOCC. At March 31, 2021, the\nCorporation\u2019s SLR was 7.0\npercent. Excluding the\ntemporary relief, the SLR\nwould have been\napproximately 6.1 percent,\nwhich is 1.1 percent, or $35\nbillion, in excess of the\n5.0 percent required by the\nFederal Reserve.\n\nDue to uncertainty resulting\nfrom the Coronavirus Disease\n2019 (COVID-19) pandemic\n(the pandemic), the Federal\nReserve required large banks\nto suspend share repurchase\nprograms during the second\nhalf of 2020, except for\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans, and to\nlimit common stock dividends\nto existing rates that did\nnot exceed the average of\nthe last four quarters\u2019 net\nincome. In December 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve\nannounced that beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nlarge banks would be\npermitted to\n\npay common stock dividends\nat existing rates and to\nrepurchase shares in an\namount that, when combined\nwith dividends paid, did not\nexceed the average of the\nlast four quarters\u2019 net\nincome. Pursuant to the\nauthorization of the Board\nof Directors (the Board),\nduring the first quarter of\n2021, we repurchased $3.5\nbillion of common stock,\nincluding repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans during the period.\nThis authorization equaled\nthe maximum amount allowed\nby the Federal Reserve for\nthe period.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, the\nFederal Reserve announced\nthat the restrictions on\ncommon stock dividends and\nshare repurchases currently\nin place will end for most\nbanks after June 30, 2021,\nfollowing the completion of\n2021 supervisory stress\ntests. Banks, including the\nCorporation, with capital\nlevels above those required\nby the stress tests will no\nlonger be subject to the\nadditional restrictions as\nof July 1, 2021, and will be\nsubject to the normal\nrestrictions under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer (SCB)\nframework.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the\nCorporation announced that\nthe Board authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $25\nbillion of common stock over\ntime. The Board also\nauthorized repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans. For the second\nquarter of 2021, the\nCorporation\u2019s repurchase\nplans will be consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nguidance that common stock\nrepurchases and common stock\ndividends, when combined,\nshould be limited to the\naverage of the last four\nquarters\u2019 net income.\nFollowing the expiration of\nthe Federal Reserve's\nrestrictions, the\nCorporation expects to\nreturn additional capital to\nshareholders through\nrepurchases and dividends\npursuant to the Board's\nauthorizations.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, the Board\ndeclared a quarterly common\nstock dividend of $0.18 per\nshare, payable on June 25,\n2021 to shareholders of\nrecord as of June 4, 2021.\n\nFor more information on our\ncapital resources and\nregulatory developments, see\nCapital Management on page\n18.\n                                                         \n  COVID-19 Pandemic                                      \n                                                         \nThe Corporation has been,\nand may continue to be,\nimpacted by the pandemic. In\nrecent months, COVID-19\nvaccination rates have been\nincreasing and restrictive\nmeasures have eased in\ncertain areas. However,\nuncertainty remains about\nthe duration of the pandemic\nand the timing and strength\nof the global economy\u2019s\nrecovery. To address the\neconomic impact of the\npandemic in the U.S.,\nmultiple stimulus packages\nhave been enacted to provide\neconomic relief to\nindividuals and businesses,\nincluding the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief and Economic\nSecurity Act (CARES Act),\nwhich established the Small\nBusiness Administration\n(SBA) Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP), and the\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of\n2021 enacted in March 2021.\n\nAs the pandemic evolves, we\ncontinue to evaluate\nprotocols and processes in\nplace to execute our\nbusiness continuity plans\nand help promote the health\nand safety of our employees.\nWe also continue to support\nthe communities we serve by\nengaging in various\ninitiatives to help those\naffected by COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to\nsupport our clients by\nproviding assistance through\nvarious measures to those\naffected by the pandemic,\nincluding by originating PPP\nloans. As of March 31, 2021,\nwe had approximately 278,000\nPPP loans outstanding with a\ncarrying value of $21.1\nbillion, which were recorded\nin the Consumer , GWIM and\nGlobal Banking segments.\nSince the PPP\u2019s inception\nthrough April 22, 2021, we\nhave received $12.1 billion\nin repayment from the SBA.\nAdditionally, we have\noriginated $8.7 billion in\nPPP loans year to date\nthrough April 22, 2021.\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic\nand public health outlooks\nimproved in the U.S. during\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nthe future\n                                                         \n  3Bank of America                                       \n                                                         \ndirect and indirect impact\nof the pandemic on our\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition remains uncertain.\nShould current economic\nconditions deteriorate or if\nthe pandemic worsens,\nincluding as the result of\nthe spread of the more\neasily communicable variants\nof COVID-19, this\nmacroeconomic environment\ncould have an adverse effect\non our businesses and\nresults of operations and\ncould adversely affect our\nfinancial condition.

Risk Factors \u2013\nCoronavirus Disease of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. LIBOR\nand Other Benchmark Rates\nFollowing the 2017\nannouncement by the U.K.\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority\n(FCA) that it would no\nlonger compel participating\nbanks to submit rates for\nthe London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) after 2021,\nregulators, trade\nassociations and financial\nindustry working groups have\nidentified recommended\nreplacement rates for LIBOR,\nas well as other Interbank\nOffered Rates (IBORs), and\nhave published recommended\nconventions to allow new and\nexisting products to\nincorporate fallbacks or\nthat reference these\nAlternative Reference Rates\n(ARRs). In March 2021, the\nFCA, which regulates LIBOR,\nannounced the dates for the\ncessation of all LIBOR\nbenchmark settings currently\npublished by the ICE\nBenchmark Administration.\nThe FCA confirmed that\npublication of all Euro and\nSwiss Franc LIBOR settings\nand most British Pound\nSterling and Japanese Yen\nLIBOR settings will cease or\nbecome no longer\nrepresentative of the\nunderlying market the rates\nseek to measure (i.e., non-\nrepresentative) immediately\nafter December 31, 2021, and\nmost U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nsettings will become non-\nrepresentative immediately\nafter June 30, 2023. The\nCorporation continues to\nexecute its enterprise-wide\nIBOR transition program. As\npart of this transition\nprogram, in March 2021, the\nCorporation ceased offering\nadjustable-rate mortgages\nlinked to LIBOR and began\noffering Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR)-linked\nadjustable-rate consumer\nmortgages. On April 1, 2021,\nthe Corporation ceased the\ninitiation of new GBP LIBOR-\nlinked loans, bonds,\nsecuritizations and linear\nderivatives that expire\nafter the end of 2021,\nsubject to certain\nexceptions. Additionally, in\nApril 2021, the Corporation\nissued a $1 billion six-\nmonth floating-rate bank\nnote referencing the one-\nmonth Bloomberg Short-Term\nBank Yield Index to multiple\ninvestors. The Corporation\ncontinues to update its\noperational models, systems,\nprocesses and internal\ninfrastructure. The\nCorporation also continues\nto work towards meeting the\nregulatory and industry-wide\nrecommended milestones on\ncessation of LIBOR; however,\nthe market and client\nreplacement of IBORs and\nadoption of ARRs continue to\nevolve and, as a result,\ncould impact the ability of\nmarket participants and the\nCorporation to transition\nactivity across or within\ncategories of contracts,\nproducts, services and\nmarkets. Accordingly, the\nCorporation continues to\nmonitor a variety of market\nscenarios as part of its\ntransition efforts,\nincluding risks associated\nwith insufficient\npreparation by individual\nmarket participants or the\noverall market ecosystem,\nability of market\nparticipants to meet\nregulatory and industry-wide\nrecommended milestones,\ndevelopment and adoption of\nSOFR, credit-sensitive and\nother rates, access and\ndemand by clients and market\nparticipants to liquidity in\ncertain products, including\nLIBOR products, and IBOR\ncontinuity beyond December\n2021. Furthermore, U.S. and\nU.K. banking regulators have\nstated that they expect to\nincrease\n\nregulatory scrutiny and\nintensify supervisory focus\nof financial institution\nLIBOR transition plans,\npreparations and readiness.\nFor more information on the\nexpected replacement of\nLIBOR and other benchmark\nrates, see Executive Summary\n\u2013 Recent Developments \u2013\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark\nRates in the MD&A and Item\n1A.

The increase\nin net income was primarily\ndue to improvement in the\nprovision for credit losses\nand higher noninterest\nincome, partially offset by\nhigher noninterest expense\nand lower net interest\nincome. Total assets\nincreased $150.4 billion\nfrom December 31, 2020 to\n$3.0 trillion primarily\ndriven by an increase in\ndebt securities due to cash\ndeployed from continued\ndeposit inflows, as well as\nhigher trading account\nassets driven by an increase\nin inventory in Global\nMarkets, partially offset by\na decrease in loans and\nleases due to continued\npaydowns. Total liabilities\nincreased $149.3 billion\nfrom December 31, 2020 to\n$2.7 trillion primarily\ndriven by an increase in\ndeposits due to additional\ngovernment stimulus measures\nas well as seasonally higher\ndeposits, an increase in\ntrading account liabilities\nresulting from higher levels\nof short positions in Global\n                                                         \n  Bank of America4                                       \n                                                         \nMarkets and higher federal\nfunds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase driven by client\nactivity in Global Markets .\nShareholders\u2019 equity\nincreased $1.1 billion from\nDecember 31, 2020 primarily\ndue to net income and\nissuance of preferred stock,\npartially offset by returns\nof capital to shareholders\nthrough common stock\nrepurchases and common and\npreferred stock dividends,\nas well as market value\ndecreases on derivatives and\ndebt securities. Net\nInterest Income Net interest\nincome decreased $1.9\nbillion to $10.2 billion for\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2021 compared to the\nsame period in 2020. Net\ninterest yield on a fully\ntaxable-equivalent (FTE)\nbasis decreased 65 basis\npoints (bps) to 1.68\npercent. The decrease in net\ninterest income was\nprimarily driven by lower\ninterest rates and loan\nbalances, partially offset\nby the deployment of excess\ncash into debt securities.\nFor more information on net\ninterest yield and the FTE\nbasis, see Supplemental\nFinancial Data on page 6,\nand for more information on\ninterest rate risk\nmanagement, see Interest\nRate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 41.\nNoninterest Income\n                                                         \n  Table 2                                                \n  (Dollars                           Three               \n  in                                Months               \n  millions)                          Ended               \n  Fees and     Nonintere\u2026         March 31               \n  commissi\u2026    Income                 2021         2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Card                       $       1,435    $   1,272  \n  income                                                 \n  Service                            1,792        1,903  \n  charges                                                \n  Investme\u2026                                              \n  and                                4,063        3,758  \n  brokerage                                              \n  services                                               \n  Investme\u2026                                              \n  banking                            2,246        1,388  \n  fees                                                   \n  Total                                                  \n  fees and                           9,536        8,321  \n  commissi\u2026                                              \n  Market                                                 \n  making                                                 \n  and                                3,529        2,807  \n  similar                                                \n  activiti\u2026                                              \n  Other                               -441         -491  \n  income                                                 \n  Total                                                  \n  noninter\u2026                  $      12,624    $  10,637  \n  income                                                 \n                                                         \nNoninterest income increased\n$2.0 billion to $12.6\nbillion for the three months\nended March 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period\nin 2020.

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude\ncertain items or otherwise\ninclude components that\ndiffer from the most\ndirectly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are\nprovided as additional\nuseful information to assess\nour financial condition,\nresults of operations\n(including period-to-period\noperating performance) or\ncompliance with prospective\nregulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as\na substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may\nnot be defined or calculated\nthe same way as non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income\nand related ratios and\nanalyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a\nconsolidated basis are non-\nGAAP financial measures. To\nderive the FTE basis, net\ninterest income is adjusted\nto reflect tax-exempt income\non an equivalent before-tax\nbasis with a corresponding\nincrease in income tax\nexpense. For purposes of\nthis calculation, we use the\nfederal statutory tax rate\nof 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax\nrate. Net interest yield,\nwhich measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost\nof funds, utilizes net\ninterest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that\npresentation of these items\non an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from\nboth taxable and tax-exempt\nsources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key\nperformance indicators and\nratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation\nadjustment (DVA) gains\n(losses)) which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that the\npresentation of measures\nthat exclude these items is\nuseful because such measures\nprovide additional\ninformation to assess the\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow\nbetter comparison of period-\nto-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our\nbusiness based on certain\nratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. Tangible equity\nrepresents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced\nby goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage\nservicing rights (MSRs)),\nnet of related deferred tax\nliabilities (\"adjusted\"\nshareholders' equity or\ncommon shareholders'\nequity). These measures are\nused to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition,\nprofitability, relationship\nand investment models use\nboth return on average\ntangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\nand return on average\ntangible shareholders\u2019\nequity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth\nobjectives. These ratios are\nas follows:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\nmeasures our net income\napplicable to common\nshareholders as a percentage\nof adjusted average common\nshareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible\nassets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders' equity\nmeasures our net income as a\npercentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019\nequity. The tangible equity\nratio represents adjusted\nending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible\nassets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per\ncommon share represents\nadjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided\nby ending common shares\noutstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing\ntangible equity provide\nadditional useful\ninformation because they\npresent measures of those\nassets that can generate\nincome. Tangible book value\nper common share provides\nadditional useful\ninformation about the level\nof tangible assets in\nrelation to outstanding\nshares of common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned\nsupplemental data and\nperformance measures are\npresented in Table 5.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures to\nthe corresponding GAAP\nfinancial measures, see Non-\nGAAP Reconciliations on page\n43.\n                                                         \n  Key Performance Indicators                             \n                                                         \nWe present certain key\nfinancial and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that\nmanagement uses when\nassessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We\nbelieve they are useful to\ninvestors because they\nprovide additional\ninformation about our\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends.\nThese key performance\nindicators (KPIs) may not be\ndefined or calculated in the\nsame way as similar KPIs\nused by other companies.

We\nutilize a methodology that\nconsiders the effect of\nregulatory capital\nrequirements in addition to\ninternal risk-based capital\nmodels. Our internal risk-\nbased capital models use a\nrisk-adjusted methodology\nincorporating each segment\u2019s\ncredit, market, interest\nrate, business and\noperational risk components.\nFor more information on the\nnature of these risks, see\nManaging Risk on page 18.\nThe capital allocated to the\nbusiness segments is\nreferred to as\n\nallocated capital. Allocated\nequity in the reporting\nunits is comprised of\nallocated capital plus\ncapital for the portion of\ngoodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the\nreporting unit.

Consumer Banking\nResults Net income for\nConsumer Banking increased\n$891 million to $2.7 billion\nduring the three months\nended March 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period\nin 2020 primarily due to an\nimprovement in the provision\nfor credit losses, partially\noffset by lower revenue and\nhigher noninterest expense.\nNet interest income\ndecreased $942 million to\n$5.9 billion primarily due\nto lower interest rates and\nloan balances, partially\noffset by the benefit of\nhigher deposit balances.\nNoninterest income decreased\n$118 million to $2.1 billion\ndriven by a decline in\nservice charges primarily\ndue to higher deposit\nbalances and lower other\nincome due to the allocation\nof asset and liability\nmanagement (ALM) results,\npartially offset by higher\ncard income due to increased\nclient activity. The\nprovision for credit losses\nimproved $2.9 billion to a\nbenefit of $617 million\nprimarily due to a reserve\nrelease, as the\nmacroeconomic outlook\nimproved and our credit\nquality remained strong.\nNoninterest expense\nincreased $635 million to\n$5.1 billion primarily\ndriven by an impairment\ncharge of $240 million for\nreal estate rationalization,\nincremental expense to\nsupport customers and\nemployees during the\npandemic, the cost of\nincreased client activity\nand continued investments\nfor business growth,\nincluding the merchant\nservices platform. The\nreturn on average allocated\ncapital was 28 percent, up\nfrom 19 percent, driven by\nhigher net income. For more\ninformation on capital\nallocated to the business\nsegments, see Business\nSegment Operations on page\n9.\n\nDeposits Net income for\nDeposits decreased $1.0\nbillion to $674 million\nprimarily driven by lower\nrevenue and higher\nnoninterest expense. Net\ninterest income declined\n$670 million to $3.3 billion\nprimarily due to lower\ninterest rates, partially\noffset by the benefit of\ngrowth in deposits.\nNoninterest income decreased\n$186 million to $898 million\nprimarily driven by lower\nservice charges due to\nhigher deposit balances, as\nwell as lower other income\ndue to the allocation of ALM\nresults. The provision for\ncredit losses decreased $41\nmillion to $74 million due\nto an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. Noninterest expense\nincreased $484 million to\n$3.2 billion driven by an\nimpairment charge for real\nestate rationalization,\ncontinued investments in the\nbusiness and incremental\nexpense to support customers\nand employees during the\npandemic. Average deposits\nincreased $186.0 billion to\n$917.3 billion driven by\nstrong organic growth and\nadditional government\nstimulus measures of $112.1\nbillion in checking and time\ndeposits and $73.1 billion\nin traditional savings and\nmoney market savings.

Management\nuses these metrics, and we\nbelieve they are useful to\ninvestors because they\nprovide additional\ninformation about loan\ngrowth and profitability.\n                                                         \n  Key                                                    \n  Statist\u2026                                               \n  \u2013                                                      \n  Consumer                                               \n  Lending                                                \n              Three                                      \n              Months                                     \n              Ended                                      \n              March 31                                   \n  (Dollars                                               \n  in                            2021            2020     \n  million\u2026                                               \n  Total                                                  \n  credit                                                 \n  card(1)                                                \n  Gross                                                  \n  interest                     10.52  %        10.49  %  \n  yield(2)                                               \n  Risk-ad\u2026                      9.29            7.94     \n  margin(\u2026                                               \n  New                                                    \n  accounts                       674           1,055     \n  (in                                                    \n  thousan\u2026                                               \n  Purchase                $   64,591       $  64,379     \n  volumes                                                \n  Debit                                                  \n  card                    $  107,907       $  88,588     \n  purchase                                               \n  volumes                                                \n                                                         \n(1) Includes GWIM's credit\ncard portfolio.

For more\ninformation about GWIM , see\nBusiness Segment Operations\nin the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nNet income for GWIM of $881\nmillion remained relatively\nunchanged for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period\nin 2020, as higher\nnoninterest income and\nimprovement in the provision\nfor credit losses were\nlargely offset by higher\nnoninterest expense and\nlower net interest income.\nThe operating margin\nremained relatively\nunchanged at 23 percent\ncompared to a year ago.\n\nNet interest income\ndecreased $240 million to\n$1.3 billion due to the\nimpact of lower interest\nrates, partially offset by\nthe benefit of strong\ndeposit and loan growth.\n\nNoninterest income, which\nprimarily includes\ninvestment and brokerage\nservices income, increased\n$275 million to $3.6 billion\nprimarily due to higher\nmarket valuations and\npositive AUM flows,\npartially offset by declines\nin AUM pricing.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses improved $254 million\nto a benefit of $65 million\nprimarily due to an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook.\nNoninterest expense\nincreased $263 million to\n$3.9 billion primarily\ndriven by higher revenue-\nrelated incentives and\ninvestments in primary sales\nprofessionals.\n\nThe return on average\nallocated capital was 22\npercent, down from 23\npercent, due to an increase\nin allocated capital.\n\nAverage loans increased $9.9\nbillion to $188.5 billion\nprimarily driven by\nsecurities-based lending,\ncustom lending and\nresidential mortgage.\nAverage deposits increased\n$63.0 billion to $326.4\nbillion primarily driven by\ninflows resulting from\nclient responses to market\nvolatility and lower\nspending.\n\nMLGWM revenue of $4.2\nbillion increased three\npercent primarily driven by\nthe benefits of higher\nmarket valuations and\npositive AUM flows,\npartially offset by the\nimpact of lower interest\nrates.\n\nBank of America Private Bank\nrevenue of $786 million\ndecreased nine percent\nprimarily driven by the\nrealignment of certain\nbusiness results to MLGWM\nand the impact of lower\ninterest rates,

The\ndecrease was primarily\ndriven by lower loan\nbalances and interest rates,\nas well as weather-related\nimpairment charges on\ncertain renewable energy\ninvestments. Global\nTransaction Services revenue\ndecreased $360 million\ndriven by lower interest\nrates, partially offset by\nthe impact of higher deposit\nbalances. Average loans and\nleases decreased 17 percent\ndriven by client paydowns\nand decreased new\noriginations due to lower\ndemand. Average deposits\nincreased 27 percent\nprimarily driven by elevated\nbalances from prior-year\ninflows on client responses\nto market volatility and\ngovernment stimulus\nmeasures.

Net DVA\nlosses were $2 million\ncompared to gains of $300\nmillion during the same\nperiod in 2020. Excluding\nnet DVA, net income\nincreased $579 million to\n$2.1 billion. These\nincreases were primarily\ndriven by\n\nhigher revenue and\nimprovement in the provision\nfor credit losses, partially\noffset by higher noninterest\nexpense.\n\nRevenue increased $1.0\nbillion to $6.2 billion\nprimarily driven by higher\nsales and trading revenue\nand investment banking fees.\nSales and trading revenue\nincreased $443 million, and\nexcluding net DVA, increased\n$745 million. These\nincreases were driven by\nhigher revenue in Fixed\nIncome, Currencies and\nCommodities (FICC) and\nEquities.\n\nThe provision for credit\nlosses improved $112 million\nto a benefit of $5 million\nprimarily due to the\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook.\n\nNoninterest expense\nincreased $612 million to\n$3.4 billion driven by\nvolume-related expenses in\nboth card and sales and\ntrading, as well as an\nacceleration in expenses\nfrom incentive compensation\naward changes.\n\nAverage total assets\nincreased $10.2 billion to\n$723.3 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period\nin 2020 as reductions in\nFICC were more than offset\nby higher client balances in\nGlobal Equities.

The\nseven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are\nstrategic, credit, market,\nliquidity, compliance,\noperational and\nreputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to\nserve our customers and\ndeliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed\nwell, risks can result in\nfinancial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and\ndamage to our reputation,\neach of which may adversely\nimpact our ability to\nexecute our business\nstrategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to\nrisk management with a\ndefined Risk Framework and\nan articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are\napproved annually by the\nEnterprise Risk Committee\nand the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as\nthe foundation for the\nconsistent and effective\nmanagement of risks facing\nthe Corporation. The Risk\nFramework sets forth clear\nroles, responsibilities and\naccountability for the\nmanagement of risk and\nprovides a blueprint for how\nthe Board, through\ndelegation of authority to\ncommittees and executive\nofficers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated\nlimits for our activities.\n\nOur Risk Appetite Statement\nis intended to ensure that\nthe Corporation maintains an\nacceptable risk profile by\nproviding a common framework\nand a comparable set of\nmeasures for senior\nmanagement and the Board to\nclearly indicate the level\nof risk the Corporation is\nwilling to accept. Risk\nappetite is set at least\nannually and is aligned with\nthe Corporation\u2019s strategic,\ncapital and financial\noperating plans. Our line-\nof-business strategies and\nrisk appetite are also\nsimilarly aligned.\n\nFor more information about\nthe Corporation's risks\nrelated to the pandemic, see\nItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013\nCoronavirus Disease of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

Based\non the results of our 2020\nCCAR supervisory stress\ntests, we are subject to a\n2.5 percent stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) from October 1,\n2020 through September 30,\n2021. Our Common equity tier\n1 (CET1) capital ratio under\nthe Standardized approach\nmust remain above 9.5\npercent during this period\n(the sum of our CET1 capital\nratio minimum of 4.5\npercent, global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB)\nsurcharge of 2.5 percent and\nour SCB of 2.5 percent) in\norder to avoid restrictions\non capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus\npayments. In April 2021, we\nsubmitted our 2021 CCAR\ncapital plan and related\nsupervisory stress tests.\nThe Federal Reserve has\nannounced that it will\ndisclose CCAR capital plan\nsupervisory stress test\nresults by July 1, 2021.\n\nDue to uncertainty resulting\nfrom the pandemic, the\nFederal Reserve required\nlarge banks to suspend share\nrepurchase programs during\nthe second half of 2020,\nexcept for repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans, and to limit common\nstock dividends to existing\nrates that did not exceed\nthe average of the last four\nquarters\u2019 net income. In\nDecember 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that\nbeginning in the first\nquarter of 2021, large banks\nwould be permitted to pay\ncommon stock dividends at\nexisting rates and to\nrepurchase shares in an\namount that,\n                                                         \n  Bank of America18                                      \n                                                         \nwhen combined with dividends\npaid, did not exceed the\naverage of the last four\nquarters\u2019 net income. On\nJanuary 19, 2021, we\nannounced that the Board\ndeclared a quarterly common\nstock dividend of $0.18 per\nshare, payable on March 26,\n2021 to shareholders of\nrecord as of March 5, 2021.\nThe Board also authorized\nthe repurchase of $2.9\nbillion in common stock\nthrough March 31, 2021, plus\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans during\nthe same period. The Board\u2019s\nauthorization equaled the\nmaximum amount allowed by\nthe Federal Reserve for the\nperiod. During the first\nquarter of 2021, we\nrepurchased $3.5 billion of\ncommon stock, including\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans during\nthe period.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, the\nFederal Reserve announced\nthat the restrictions on\ncommon stock dividends and\nshare repurchases currently\nin place will end for most\nbanks after June 30, 2021,\nfollowing the completion of\n2021 supervisory stress\ntests. Banks, including the\nCorporation, with capital\nlevels above those required\nby the stress tests will no\nlonger be subject to the\nadditional restrictions as\nof July 1, 2021, and will be\nsubject to the normal\nrestrictions under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s SCB\nframework.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the\nCorporation announced that\nthe Board authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $25\nbillion of common stock over\ntime. The Board also\nauthorized repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans. For the second\nquarter of 2021, the\nCorporation\u2019s repurchase\nplans will be consistent\nwith the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nguidance that common stock\nrepurchases and common stock\ndividends, when combined,\nshould be limited to the\naverage of the last four\nquarters\u2019 net income.\nFollowing the expiration of\nthe Federal Reserve's\nrestrictions, the\nCorporation expects to\nreturn additional capital to\nshareholders through\nrepurchases and dividends\npursuant to the Board's\nauthorizations.\n\nThe timing and amount of\ncommon stock repurchases\nmade pursuant to our stock\nrepurchase program are\nsubject to various factors,\nincluding the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity,\nfinancial performance and\nalternative uses of capital,\nstock trading price,\nregulatory requirements and\ngeneral market conditions,\nand may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may\nbe effected through open\nmarket purchases or\n\nprivately negotiated\ntransactions, including\nrepurchase plans that\nsatisfy the conditions of\nRule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (Exchange\nAct).\n                                                         \n  Regulatory Capital                                     \n                                                         \nAs a financial services\nholding company, we are\nsubject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including\nBasel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators.

percent at both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020. At March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, the\nCorporation's SCB of 2.5\npercent was applied in place\nof the capital conservation\nbuffer under the\nStandardized approach. The\ncountercyclical capital\nbuffer for both periods was\nzero.

The\ncountercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC\nsupplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum\nconsists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage\nbuffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be\ncomprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital,\nrespectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is\ncomprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent\nrequirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure\nregulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to\ncalculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the\nStandardized approach as of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 reflect the temporary exclusion of U.S.\nTreasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is\nprimarily driven by deposit\nand lending activity, as\nwell as securities valuation\nand net debt activity. Bank\nsubsidiaries can also\ngenerate incremental\nliquidity by pledging a\nrange of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain\nFederal Home Loan Banks\n(FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained\nby borrowing against this\npool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets\nwas $294 billion and $306\nbillion at March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020.

Due to\nregulatory restrictions,\nliquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can\ngenerally be used only to\nfund obligations within the\nbank subsidiaries, and\n\ntransfers to the parent\ncompany or nonbank\nsubsidiaries may be subject\nto prior regulatory\napproval. Liquidity is also\nheld in nonbank entities,\nincluding the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated\nentities. Parent company and\nNB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of\ncash deposited at BANA,\nwhich is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank\nsubsidiaries, and high-\nquality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities.\nLiquidity held in other\nregulated entities,\ncomprised primarily of\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nis primarily available to\nmeet the obligations of that\nentity, and transfers to the\nparent company or to any\nother subsidiary may be\nsubject to prior regulatory\napproval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum\nrequirements.

Of the\nnonperforming residential\nmortgage loans at March 31,\n2021, $1.3 billion, or 53\npercent, were current on\ncontractual payments. Loans\naccruing past due 30 days or\nmore decreased $88 million.\n\nNet recoveries of $4 million\nfor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021 remained\nrelatively unchanged\ncompared to the same period\nin 2020.\n\nOf the $202.8 billion in\ntotal residential mortgage\nloans outstanding at March\n31, 2021, as shown in Table\n19, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only\nloans. The outstanding\nbalance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans\nthat have entered the\namortization period was $5.6\nbillion, or 10 percent, at\nMarch 31, 2021. Residential\nmortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization\nperiod generally have\nexperienced a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies\nand nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential\nmortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At March 31, 2021,\n$113 million, or two\npercent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered\nthe amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or\nmore compared to $1.1\nbillion, or less than one\npercent, for the\n\nentire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2021, $302\nmillion, or five percent, of\noutstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the\namortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $112\nmillion were contractually\ncurrent, compared to $2.4\nbillion, or one percent, for\nthe entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the\namortization period in our\ninterest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our\nwealth management clients\nand have an interest-only\nperiod of three to ten\nyears.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity\nloans at March 31, 2021,\n$261 million, or 39 percent\nwere current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $252\nmillion, or 38 percent of\nnonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more\npast due and had been\nwritten down to the\nestimated fair value of the\ncollateral, less costs to\nsell. Accruing loans that\nwere 30 days or more past\ndue decreased $17 million\nduring the three months\nended March 31, 2021.\n\nNet recoveries increased $24\nmillion to $35 million for\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2021 compared to the\nsame period in 2020 driven\nby favorable portfolio\ntrends due in part to\nimprovement in home prices.\n\nOf the $32.1 billion in\ntotal home equity portfolio\noutstandings at March 31,\n2021, as shown in Table 20,\n15 percent require interest-\nonly payments. The\noutstanding balance of\nHELOCs that have reached the\nend of their draw period and\nhave entered the\namortization period was $8.6\nbillion at March 31, 2021.\nThe HELOCs that have entered\nthe amortization period have\nexperienced a higher\npercentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and\nnonperforming status when\ncompared to the HELOC\nportfolio as a whole. At\nMarch 31, 2021, $109\nmillion, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had\nentered the amortization\nperiod were accruing past\ndue 30\n\ndays or more. In addition,\nat March 31, 2021, $484\nmillion, or six percent,\nwere nonperforming. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the\namortization period in our\ninterest-only portfolio are\nprimarily post-2008 vintages\nand generally have better\ncredit quality than the\nprevious vintages that had\nentered the amortization\nperiod. We communicate to\ncontractually current\ncustomers more than a year\nprior to the end of their\ndraw period to inform them\nof the potential change to\nthe payment structure before\nentering the amortization\nperiod, and provide payment\noptions to customers prior\nto the end of the draw\nperiod.\n\nAlthough we do not actively\ntrack how many of our home\nequity customers pay only\nthe minimum amount due on\ntheir home equity loans and\nlines, we can infer some of\nthis information through a\nreview of our HELOC\nportfolio that we service\nand that is still in its\nrevolving period.

The\nincrease in commercial\ncommitted exposure was\nconcentrated in the\nTelecommunication services,\nFinance companies, Asset\nmanagers and funds, and\nSoftware and services\nindustry sectors. Increases\nwere partially offset by\ndecreased exposure to the\nGovernment and public\neducation and Capital goods\nindustry sectors.\n\nFor information on industry\nlimits, see Commercial\nPortfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAsset managers and funds,\nour largest industry\nconcentration with committed\nexposure of $106.7 billion,\nincreased $5.1 billion, or\nfive percent, during the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021.\n\nReal estate, our second\nlargest industry\nconcentration with committed\nexposure of $90.6 billion,\ndecreased $1.8 billion, or\ntwo percent, during the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021.

The\nimpact of the pandemic has\nalso placed significant\nstress on global demand for\noil, resulting in a steep\ndecline in prices for much\nof 2020. However, oil prices\nrebounded late in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 and early in\nthe\n\nfirst quarter of 2021. Our\nenergy-related committed\nexposure decreased $558\nmillion, or two percent,\nduring the three months\nended March 31, 2021 to\n$32.4 billion, driven by\ndeclines in energy equipment\nand services

To\nlower the cost of obtaining\nour desired credit\nprotection levels, we may\nadd credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by\nselling protection. At March\n31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, net notional credit\ndefault protection purchased\nin our credit derivatives\nportfolio to hedge our\nfunded and unfunded\nexposures for which we\nelected the fair value\noption, as well as certain\nother credit exposures, was\n$4.3 billion and $4.2\nbillion. We recorded net\nlosses of $36 million for\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2021 compared to net\ngains of $229 million for\nthe same period in 2020 for\nthese same positions. The\ngains and losses on these\ninstruments were offset by\ngains and losses on the\n\nrelated exposures.

We define country\nrisk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and\npolitical conditions, currency fluctuations, social\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to measure, monitor and\nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a country, we also are\nexposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing transactions or\nrelated to client clearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal course of business\nthrough credit, market and operational risk governance\nrather than through country risk governance.

Table 36\npresents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at\nMarch 31, 2021. These exposures accounted for 91 percent\nand 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net country exposure for\nthese 20 countries increased $23.1 billion during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021. The majority of the\nincrease was due to higher deposits with the central bank\nof Japan and increased corporate exposure in Canada.\n                                                         \n                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                             $      $    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                             $      $    \n                                                         \nOur largest non-U.S. country\nexposure at March 31, 2021\nwas the U.K. with net\nexposure of $58.8 billion,\nwhich represents a $685\nmillion decrease from\nDecember 31, 2020.

The interest\nrate scenarios also assume\nU.S. dollar rates are\nfloored at zero. During the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021, the decrease in asset\nsensitivity of our balance\nsheet to Up-rate and Down-\nrate scenarios was primarily\ndue to an increase in long-\nend rates. We continue to be\nasset sensitive to a\nparallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the\nmajority of that impact\ncoming from the short end of\nthe yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher\ninterest rates impact the\nfair value of debt\nsecurities and, accordingly,\nfor debt securities\nclassified as AFS, may\nadversely affect OCI and\nthus capital levels under\nthe Basel 3 capital rules.\nUnder instantaneous upward\nparallel shifts, the near-\nterm adverse impact to Basel\n3 capital is reduced over\ntime by offsetting positive\nimpacts to net interest\nincome.

As\npart of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain\nresidential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing interest rate\nsensitivity. The behavior of our deposits portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates\nof net interest income.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes no change in\ndeposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast\nin alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios,\nany customer activity resulting in the replacement of\nlow-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits with higher\nyielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce\nour benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign\nExchange Derivative Contracts We use interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate and foreign\nexchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to\nmanage both the variability in cash flows and changes in\nfair value of various assets and liabilities arising from\nthose risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are\ngenerally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark\ninterest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options,\nfutures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts\ninclude cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign\ncurrency futures contracts, foreign currency forward\ncontracts and options. The derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad categories:\ndesignated accounting hedges and other risk management\nderivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily\nused to manage our exposure to interest rates as\ndescribed in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in the\nsensitivities presented in Table 42. The Corporation also\nuses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to\nmanage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange\nrisk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market\nrisk exposure in this area is insignificant. Risk\nmanagement derivatives are predominantly used to hedge\nforeign exchange risks related to various foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate\nsubstantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash\nflows of the Corporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-\ndenominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange\nderivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures\nsuch as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate\nrisk. However, as these features are not a significant\ncomponent of these foreign exchange derivatives, the\nmarket risk related to this exposure is insignificant.\nFor more information on the accounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject\nus to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will be held for\ninvestment or held for sale at the time of commitment and\nmanage credit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes\nin interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock\ncommitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first\nmortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value\nof the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these\nhedged items offset, we combine them into one overall\nhedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and securities. For\nmore information on IRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in\nthe MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020, we recorded gains of $13 million and $163 million\nrelated to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs\nand LHFS, net of\n                                                         \n  Bank of America42                                      \n                                                         \ngains and losses on the\nhedge portfolio. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see\nNote 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                         \n   Climate Risk Management                               \n                                                         \nClimate-related risks are\ndivided into two major\ncategories: (1) risks\nrelated to the transition to\na low-carbon economy, and\n(2) risks related to the\nphysical impacts of climate\nchange. The financial\nimpacts of transition risk\ncan lead to and amplify\ncredit risk. Physical risk\ncan also lead to increased\ncredit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral\nvalues. As climate risk is\ninterconnected with all key\nrisk types, we have\ndeveloped and continue to\nenhance processes to embed\nclimate risk considerations\ninto our Risk Framework and\nrisk management programs\nestablished for strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and\nreputational risks.

holding company and a\nfinancial holding company,\nprovides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and\nproducts throughout the U.S.\nand in certain international\nmarkets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein\nmay refer to Bank of America\nCorporation, individually,\nBank of America Corporation\nand its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s subsidiaries\nor affiliates. Principles of\nConsolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements include the\naccounts of the Corporation\nand its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those\nvariable interest entities\n(VIEs) where the Corporation\nis the primary beneficiary.\nIntercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been\neliminated. Results of\noperations of acquired\ncompanies are included from\nthe dates of acquisition,\nand for VIEs, from the dates\nthat the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary.\nAssets held in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. The\nCorporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for\nwhich it owns a voting\ninterest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over\noperating and financing\ndecisions using the equity\nmethod of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in\nother assets. Equity method\ninvestments are subject to\nimpairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate\nshare of income or loss is\nincluded in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in conformity\nwith accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the\nUnited States of America\nrequires management to make\nestimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts\nand disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially\ndiffer from those estimates\nand assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with\nthe audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is\nsuch that the results of any\ninterim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of\nresults for a full year. In\nthe opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which\nconsist of normal recurring\nadjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the\ninterim period results, have\nbeen made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events\nthrough the date of filing\nwith the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Certain\nprior-period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform\nto current-period\npresentation.\nNOTE 2 Net Interest Income\nand Noninterest Income\nThe table below presents the\nCorporation\u2019s net interest\nincome and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by\nrevenue source for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021\nand 2020. For more\ninformation, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K .

Financial instruments\ncollateral includes securities collateral received or\npledged and cash securities held and posted at third-\nparty custodians that are not offset on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net\nderivative assets and liabilities.\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges The\nCorporation uses various types of interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative contracts to protect against\nchanges in the fair value of its assets and liabilities\ndue to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates\n(fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these\ntypes of contracts to protect against changes in the cash\nflows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted\ntransactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges\nits net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations\ndetermined to have functional currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-\ncurrency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-\ndenominated debt (net investment hedges).

amount payable\nby the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However,\nthe Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit\nderivatives based solely on the notional amount because\nthis measure does not take into consideration the\nprobability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount\nis not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure\nto these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to\ndefine risk tolerances and establish limits so that\ncertain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in\nthe table above include investments in securities issued\nby collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized\nloan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles.\nThese instruments are primarily classified as trading\nsecurities. The carrying value of these instruments\nequals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the\nentities under the terms of the securities owned.\n                                                         \n  Bank of America54                                      \n                                                         \nCredit-related Contingent\nFeatures and Collateral\nCertain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain\ncredit risk-related\ncontingent features,\nprimarily in the form of\nISDA master netting\nagreements and credit\nsupport documentation that\nenhance the creditworthiness\nof these instruments\ncompared to other\nobligations of the\nrespective counterparty with\nwhom the Corporation has\ntransacted. These contingent\nfeatures may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation\nas well as its\ncounterparties with respect\nto changes in the\nCorporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the\nmark-to-market exposure\nunder the derivative\ntransactions. At March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nthe Corporation held cash\nand securities collateral of\n$ 89.3billion and $\n96.5billion and posted cash\nand securities collateral of\n$ 72.7billion and $\n88.6billion in the normal\ncourse of business under\nderivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product\nmargining agreements where\nclients are permitted to\nmargin on a net basis for\nboth derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In\nconnection with certain\nover-the-counter derivative\ncontracts and other trading\nagreements, the Corporation\ncan be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to\nterminate transactions with\ncertain counterparties in\nthe event of a downgrade of\nthe senior debt ratings of\nthe Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral\nrequired depends on the\ncontract and is usually a\nfixed incremental amount\nand/or the market value of\nthe exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-\nrelated contingent features\nand collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. At\nMarch 31, 2021, the amount\nof collateral, calculated\nbased on the terms of the\ncontracts, that the\nCorporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be\nrequired to post to\ncounterparties but had not\nyet posted to counterparties\nwas $ 3.0billion, including\n$ 1.9billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National\nAssociation.

At March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 residential mortgage includes $\n527million and $ 537million of loans on which interest\nhad been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration\n(FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest,\nalthough principal was still insured, and $ 201million\nand $ 225million of loans on which interest was still\naccruing.\n\n(3) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated\nfair value of the underlying collateral less any costs to\nsell is greater than the amortized cost of the loans as\nof the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit\nquality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and\nOther Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based\non primary credit quality indicators. For more\ninformation on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real\nEstate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality\nindicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and\nrefreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed\nLTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a\npercentage of the value of the property securing the\nloan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and\navailable line of credit combined with any outstanding\nsenior liens against the property as a percentage of the\nvalue of the property securing the loan, refreshed\nquarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of\nthe borrower based on the financial obligations of the\nborrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores\nare typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently.\nCertain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts\ndischarged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their\nFICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary\ncredit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other\nConsumer portfolio segment and the business card\nportfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within\nthe Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated\nusing the internal classifications of pass rated or\nreservable criticized as the primary credit quality\nindicators. The term reservable criticized refers to\nthose commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard\nor Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined\nby regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated\nlevel of risk and may have a high probability of default\nor total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not\nconsidered reservable criticized. In addition to these\nprimary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses\nother credit quality indicators for certain types of\nloans. The following tables present certain credit\nquality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real\nEstate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial\nportfolio segments by class of financing receivables and\nyear of origination for term loan balances at March 31,\n2021, including revolving loans that converted to term\nloans without an additional credit decision after\norigination or through a TDR.\n                                                         \n  61Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \n

Consumer Real Estate Modifications of consumer\nreal estate loans are classified as TDRs when the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a\nconcession has been granted. Concessions may include\nreductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due\namounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment\nextensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or\ncombinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a\nloan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications\nwith certain borrowers under both government and\nproprietary programs. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-month period during which the\nborrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into\na permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are\nclassified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether\nthe borrower enters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $ 358million that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were\nincluded in TDRs at March 31, 2021, of which $ 103million\nwere classified as nonperforming and $ 65million were\nloans fully insured. Consumer real estate TDRs are\nmeasured primarily based on the net present value of the\nestimated cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR\nexceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as\na component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are\nconsidered to be dependent solely on the collateral for\nrepayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification)\nare measured based on the estimated fair value of the\ncollateral, and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying\nvalue exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer\nreal estate loans that reach 180 days past due prior to\nmodification are charged off to their net realizable\nvalue, less costs to sell, before they are modified as\nTDRs in accordance with established policy. Subsequent\ndeclines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan\nhas reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-\noffs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal\nloss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an\nallowance for loan and lease losses on the outstanding\nprincipal balance, even after they have been modified in\na TDR. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, remaining\ncommitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose\nterms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR\nwere not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed\nproperties totaled $ 101million and $ 123million at March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including fully-insured\nloans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess at March 31, 2021 was $ 1.1billion. Although the\nCorporation has paused formal loan foreclosure\nproceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied\nproperties, during the three months ended March 31, 2021,\nthe Corporation reclassified $ 10million of consumer real\nestate loans completed or which were in process prior to\nthe pause in foreclosures, to foreclosed properties or,\nfor properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured\nloans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent\nnon-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not\nreflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe table below presents the March 31, 2021 and 2020\nunpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average\npre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The following\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include\nloans that were initially classified as TDRs during the\nperiod and also loans that had previously been classified\nas TDRs and were modified again during the period.\n                                                         \n  Con\u2026                                                   \n  Real

Credit card\nand other consumer loan modifications generally involve\nreducing the interest rate on the account, placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months\nand canceling the customer\u2019s available line of credit,\nall of which are considered TDRs.

For more\ninformation on the\nCorporation's loan\nmodification programs\noffered in response to the\npandemic, most of which are\nnot TDRs, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nCredit card and other\nconsumer loans are deemed to\nbe in payment default during\nthe quarter in which a\nborrower misses the second\nof twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of\nthe factors considered when\nprojecting future cash flows\nin the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses for credit card and\nother consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the\nCorporation estimates that\n12percent of new credit card\nTDRs and 20percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer\nTDRs may be in payment\ndefault within 12months\nafter modification.\nCommercial Loans\nModifications of loans to\ncommercial borrowers that\nare experiencing financial\ndifficulty are designed to\nreduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while\nproviding the borrower with\nan opportunity to work\nthrough financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy.\nEach modification is unique\nand reflects the individual\ncircumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that\nresult in a TDR may include\nextensions of maturity at a\nconcessionary (below market)\nrate of interest, payment\nforbearances or other\nactions designed to benefit\nthe borrower while\nmitigating the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk exposure. Reductions in\ninterest rates are rare.\nInstead, the interest rates\nare typically increased,\nalthough the increased rate\nmay not represent a market\nrate of interest.\nInfrequently, concessions\nmay also include principal\nforgiveness in connection\nwith foreclosure, short sale\nor other settlement\nagreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the\nloan. At the time of\nrestructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the\nimpact, if any, on projected\ncash flows resulting from\nthe modified terms. If a\nportion of the loan is\ndeemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded\nat the time of\nrestructuring.\nAlternatively, a charge-off\nmay have already been\nrecorded in a previous\nperiod such that no charge-\noff is required at the time\nof modification. During the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021 and 2020, the carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were\nmodified as TDRs was $\n680million and $ 876million.\nAt March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nCorporation had $ 2.0billion\nand $ 1.7billion of\ncommercial TDRs with\nremaining commitments to\nlend additional funds to\ndebtors of $ 364million and\n$ 402million. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 198million and\n$ 218million at March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020.\nLoans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $\n7.9billion and $ 9.2billion\nat March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. Cash and\nnon-cash proceeds from sales\nand paydowns of loans\noriginally classified as\nLHFS were $ 9.9billion and $\n7.5billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021\nand 2020. Cash used for\noriginations and purchases\nof LHFS totaled\napproximately $ 8.3billion\nand $ 6.1billion for the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021 and 2020.\n\nAccrued Interest Receivable\nAccrued interest receivable\nfor loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020 was $ 2.4billion\nand is reported in customer\nand other receivables on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nOutstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and\nfees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as\nnonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than\nthe end of the month in\nwhich the account becomes\n180 days past due, within 60\ndays after receipt of\nnotification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon\nconfirmation of fraud .\nDuring the three months\nended March 31, 2021, the\nCorporation reversed $\n158million of interest and\nfee income against the\nincome statement line item\nin which it was originally\nrecorded upon charge-off of\nthe principal balance of the\nloan . For the outstanding\nresidential mortgage, home\nequity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan\nbalances classified as\nnonperforming during the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2021, the Corporation\nreversed $ 8million of\ninterest and fee income at\nthe time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming\nagainst the income statement\nline item in which it was\noriginally recorded. For\nmore information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming\nloan policies, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using\nquantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a\nvariety of factors, such as\nhistorical loss experience,\nthe current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an\neconomic outlook over the\nlife of the loan.\nQualitative reserves cover\nlosses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's\nassessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. The\nCorporation incorporates\nforward-looking information\nthrough the use of several\nmacroeconomic scenarios in\ndetermining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the\nforecasted life of the\nassets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic\nvariables such as gross\ndomestic product,\nunemployment rate, real\nestate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen each quarter\nand the weighting given to\neach scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including\nrecent economic events,\nleading economic indicators,\ninternal and third-party\neconomist views, and\nindustry trends. For more\ninformation on the\nCorporation's credit loss\naccounting policies\nincluding the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. The\nMarch 31, 2021 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses\nwas based on various\neconomic outlooks that\nincluded consensus\nestimates, multiple downside\nscenarios that\n                                                         \n  Bank of America68                                      \n                                                         \nassumed a significantly longer period until economic\nrecovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely\nadverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside\nscenario to reflect the continued improvement in the\nconsensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumed\nthat the U.S. unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will\nbe relatively consistent with the level as of March 2021,\nwhich was slightly above six percent. Additionally, in\nthis economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product was\nassumed to return to pre-pandemic levels at the end of\n2021. The allowance for credit losses considered the\nimpact of enacted government stimulus measures and\ncontinued to factor in the uncertainty resulting from the\nunprecedented nature of the current health crisis and\nrisks that may prevent a full economic recovery. The\nCorporation also factored into its allowance for credit\nlosses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that\nincluded leveraged loans and industries such as travel\nand entertainment, which have been adversely impacted by\nthe effects of the pandemic, as well as the energy\nsector. The allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2021\nwas $ 18.0billion, a decrease of $ 2.7billion compared to\nDecember 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for\ncredit losses was primarily driven by an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook and loan balance declines. The\ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses was comprised\nof a net decrease of $ 2.6billion in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and a $ 49million decrease in the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in\nthe allowance for credit losses was attributed to $\n182million in the consumer real estate portfolio, $\n1.3billion in the credit card and other consumer\nportfolio, and $ 1.2billion in the commercial portfolio.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option decreased $ 25.1billion\nin the three months ended March 31, 2021, driven by\nconsumer loans, which decreased $ 16.5billion primarily\ndue to a decline in consumer real estate due to\nprepayments in a low rate environment and a decline in\ncredit card loans from seasonality and higher payments.\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including\nnet charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses,\nare detailed in the table below.\n

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home\nequity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the\nreserve for representations and warranties obligations\nand corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note\n10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies .\n\n(2) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans and\nleases in the consolidated credit card trust included $\n5.0billion and $ 7.6billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using\nquoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2\nof the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests,\nprimarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity\nloans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to\nprovide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid\namortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges\nthat will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the\nhome equity lines of credit, performance of the loans,\nthe amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related\ncash flows. Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation\nsecuritizes originated and purchased credit card loans.\nThe Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trust includes servicing the receivables,\nretaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s interest) in\nthe receivables, and holding certain retained interests,\nincluding subordinate interests, in accrued interest and\nfees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve\naccounts. No new senior debt securities were issued to\nthird-party investors from the credit card securitization\ntrust during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCorporation held subordinate securities issued by the\ncredit card securitization trust with a notional\nprincipal amount of $ 6.6billion and $ 6.8billion. These\nsecurities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the\nsenior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent. No subordinate securities were issued by the\ncredit card securitization trust during the three months\nended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Resecuritization Trusts\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into\nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant\nongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust,\nand no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $\n1.0billion and $ 7.4billion of securities during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Securities\ntransferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recorded in market\nmaking and similar activities prior to the\nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on\nsale was recorded. During the three months ended March\n31, 2021 and 2020, resecuritization proceeds included\nsecurities with an initial fair value of $ 178million and\n$ 526million. Substantially all of the trading account\nsecurities carried at fair value were categorized as\nLevel 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond\nTrusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts\nthat hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal\nbonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-\nrate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other\nshort-term basis to third-party investors.

The\nCorporation structures the\ntrusts and holds a\nsignificant residual\ninterest. The net investment\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to the\ntrusts in the unlikely event\nthat the leveraged lease\ninvestments become\nworthless. Debt issued by\nthe leveraged lease trusts\nis non-recourse to the\nCorporation. Tax Credit VIEs\nThe Corporation holds\ninvestments in\nunconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar\nentities that construct, own\nand operate affordable\nhousing, wind and solar\nprojects.

predominantly\nrelated to cash segregated\nin compliance with\nsecurities regulations and\ncash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet\nreserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and\nContingencies\n\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation\nenters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments.\nThese commitments expose the\nCorporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the\nsame credit and market risk\nlimitation reviews as those\ninstruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor more information on\ncommitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Credit\nExtension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into\ncommitments to extend credit\nsuch as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit\n(SBLCs) and commercial\nletters of credit to meet\nthe financing needs of its\ncustomers. The following\ntable includes the notional\namount of\n\nunfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of\namounts distributed (i.e.,\nsyndicated or participated)\nto other financial\ninstitutions. The\ndistributed amounts were $\n10.9billion and $\n10.5billion at March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020.\nThe carrying value of these\ncommitments at March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nexcluding commitments\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option, was $\n1.8billion and $ 1.9billion,\nwhich primarily related to\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these\ncommitments is classified in\naccrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegally binding commitments\nto extend credit generally\nhave specified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse\nchange clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay.\nThe following table includes\nthe notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 4.6billion\nand $ 4.0billion at March\n31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020 that are accounted for\nunder the fair value option.\nHowever, the table excludes\ncumulative net fair value of\n$ 91million and $ 99million\nat March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 on these\ncommitments, which is\nclassified in accrued\nexpenses and other\nliabilities. For more\ninformation regarding the\nCorporation\u2019s loan\ncommitments accounted for\nunder the fair value option,\nsee Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value\nOption.\n

consumer SBLCs of $\n481million and $ 500million at March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\n(3) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nincluded are letters of credit of $ 1.8billion related

At March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, the Corporation had commitments to\npurchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of\n$ 430million and $ 582million, which upon settlement will\nbe included in trading account assets. At March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, the Corporation had commitments to\nenter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities\nborrowing agreements of $ 119.0billion and $ 66.5billion,\nand commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase\nand securities lending agreements of $ 60.6billion and $\n32.1billion. These commitments generally expire within\nthe next 12 months. At both March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, the Corporation had a commitment to originate\nor purchase up to $ 3.9billion on a rolling 12-month\nbasis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner.\nThis commitment extends through November 2022 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. Other Guarantees\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The\nCorporation sells products that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At\nboth March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the notional\namount of these guarantees totaled $ 7.1billion. At both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $\n1.1billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033\nand 2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role\nas merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant\nacquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges\nthat cannot be collected from the merchants, due to,\namong other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If\ncharges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot\nbe collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these\nreversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable regulatory and card\nnetwork rules, which include, but are not limited to, the\ntype of charge, type of payment used and time limits. For\nthe three months ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation\nprocessed an aggregate purchase volume of $ 301.1billion.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to\ncircumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or\nservices for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates\nthis risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters\nof credit or other types of collateral from certain\nmerchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent\nlosses and the losses incurred related to the merchant\nprocessing activity were not significant. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the\npotential economic impacts of the pandemic.\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note\n12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K . The reserve for representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $\n1.3billion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nand is included in accrued\n                                                         \n  Bank of America76                                      \n                                                         \nexpenses and other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand the related provision is\nincluded in other income in\nthe Consolidated Statement\nof Income. The\nrepresentations and\nwarranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s\nbest estimate of probable\nincurred losses, is based on\nits experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject\nto judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or\nunknown uncertainties.\nFuture representations and\nwarranties losses may occur\nin excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these\nexposures; however, the\nCorporation does not expect\nsuch amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's\nfinancial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation\nand Regulatory Matters below\nfor the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible\nloss in excess of the\nreserve for representations\nand warranties and the\naccrued liability for\nlitigation. Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\nSponsored Member Repo\nProgram The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a\nrepo program whereby the\nCorporation clears certain\neligible resale and\nrepurchase agreements\nthrough the Government\nSecurities Division of the\nFixed Income Clearing\nCorporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored\nmembers in accordance with\nthe Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation\u2019s rules. As part\nof this program, the\nCorporation guarantees the\npayment and performance of\nits sponsored members to the\nFixed Income Clearing\nCorporation. The\nCorporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or\nhigh-quality securities\ncollateral placed by clients\nwith the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for\nthe Corporation to incur\nsignificant losses under\nthis arrangement is remote.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum\npotential exposure, without\ntaking into consideration\nthe related collateral, was\n$ 3.4billion and $\n22.5billion at March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020.\nOther Guarantees The\nCorporation has entered into\nadditional guarantee\nagreements and commitments,\nincluding sold risk\nparticipation swaps,\nliquidity facilities, lease-\nend obligation agreements,\npartial credit guarantees on\ncertain leases, real estate\njoint venture guarantees,\ndivested business\ncommitments and sold put\noptions that require gross\nsettlement. The maximum\npotential future payments\nunder these agreements are\napproximately $ 9.2billion\nand $ 8.8billion at March\n31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. The estimated maturity\ndates of these obligations\nextend up to 2049. The\nCorporation has made no\nmaterial payments under\nthese guarantees. For more\ninformation on maximum\npotential future payments\nunder VIE-related liquidity\ncommitments, see Note 6 \u2013\nSecuritizations and Other\nVariable Interest Entities .\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the\nobligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-\nrelated transactions and\nnon-ISDA related\ntransactions such as\ncommodities trading,\nrepurchase agreements, prime\nbrokerage agreements and\nother transactions.\nGuarantees of Certain Long-\nterm Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully\nand unconditionally\nguarantees the securities\nissued by BofA Finance LLC,\na consolidated finance\nsubsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of\ntrust securities issued by\ncertain statutory trust\ncompanies that are\n100percent owned finance\nsubsidiaries of the\nCorporation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory\nMatters The following\ndisclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K (the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure).\nIn the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the Corporation\nand its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or\nparties to many pending and\nthreatened legal, regulatory\nand governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate\ndamages or where the matters\npresent novel legal theories\nor involve a large number of\nparties, the Corporation\ngenerally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the\npending matters, timing of\nthe ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual\nloss, fines or penalties\nrelated to each pending\nmatter. As a matter\ndevelops, the Corporation,\nin conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the\nmatter, evaluates whether\nsuch matter presents a loss\ncontingency that is probable\nand estimable, and, for the\nmatter described below and\nthe matters disclosed in the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure,\nwhether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is\nreasonably possible in\nfuture periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed\nto be both probable and\nestimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued\nliability and record a\ncorresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense.\nThe Corporation continues to\nmonitor the matter for\nfurther developments that\ncould affect the amount of\nthe accrued liability that\nhas been previously\nestablished. Excluding\nexpenses of internal and\nexternal legal service\nproviders, litigation-\nrelated expense of $\n34million and $ 24million\nwas recognized for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021\nand 2020. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure,\nfor which a loss in future\nperiods is reasonably\npossible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an\naccrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued\nliability) and for\nrepresentations and\nwarranties exposures, the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $\n0to $ 1.3billion in excess\nof the accrued liability, if\nany, as of March 31, 2021.\nThe accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible\nloss are based upon\ncurrently available\ninformation and subject to\nsignificant judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown\nuncertainties. The matters\nunderlying the accrued\nliability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change\nfrom time to time, and\nactual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the\ncurrent estimate and\naccrual. The estimated range\nof possible loss does not\nrepresent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided\nbelow, or in the prior\ncommitments and\ncontingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where\nspecified, associated\nclaimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and\ntaking into account accrued\nliabilities, management does\nnot believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from\npending matters, including\nthe matter described below,\nand in the prior commitments\nand contingencies\ndisclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on\nthe consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of\nthe Corporation. However, in\nlight of the significant\njudgment, variety of\nassumptions and\nuncertainties involved in\nthose matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s\ncontrol, and the very large\nor indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those\nmatters, an adverse outcome\nin one or more of these\nmatters could be\n                                                         \n  77Bank of America                                      \n                                                         \nmaterial to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or\nresults of operations for\nany particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm.

At March 31,\n2021, the Corporation had\nreserved 451million unissued\nshares of common stock for\nfuture issuances under\nemployee stock plans,\nconvertible notes and\npreferred stock.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, the Board\nof Directors declared a\nquarterly common stock\ndividend at the current rate\nof $ 0.18per share.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nDuring the three months\nended March 31, 2021, the\nCorporation declared $\n490million of cash dividends\non\npreferred stock. On January 28, 2021, the Corporation\nissued approximately 37,000shares of 4.125% Non-\nCumulative Preferred Stock, Series PP for $ 915million,\nwith quarterly dividends commencing in May 2021. The\nSeries PP preferred stock has a liquidation preference of\n25,000per share and is subject to certain restrictions in\nthe event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full\ndividends.

Restricted\nStock Units During the three months ended March 31, 2021,\nthe Corporation granted 98million restricted stock unit\n(RSU) awards to certain employees under the Bank of\nAmerica Key Employee Equity Plan. Other than an\ninsignificant amount that are settled in cash, the RSUs\nwill be settled in shares of common stock of the\nCorporation. Eighteen millionof the RSU awards will vest\nover three years, and the remainder will generally vest\nover four years, provided that the employee remains\ncontinuously employed with the Corporation during that\ntime. The RSUs will be expensed ratably over the life of\nthe awards, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the\ngrant-date fair value of the shares, except for awards\nthat contain a retirement-eligibility provision and were\nissued to retirement-eligible employees, as these awards\nare generally expensed in the year preceding the grant\ndate. Certain RSU awards granted during the three months\nended March 31, 2021 were subsequently modified to\ninclude a retirement-eligibility provision, resulting in\nadditional compensation and benefits
