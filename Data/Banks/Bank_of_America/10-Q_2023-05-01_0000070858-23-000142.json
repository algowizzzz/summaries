At March 31, 2023, Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s direct exposure to these\nfinancial institutions was not\nsignificant.\n\nTo help deploy financial strength and\nliquidity into the larger banking\nsystem, Bank of America and certain\nother U.S. financial institutions made\nuninsured deposits totaling $30 billion\ninto First Republic Bank. The amount of\nBank of America\u2019s uninsured deposit was\n$5 billion and is recorded in Time\ndeposits placed and other short-term\ninvestments on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) announced\nthat it was appointed as receiver of\nFirst Republic Bank and entered into a\npurchase and assumption agreement with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, National\nAssociation (JPMorgan Chase Bank) to\nassume all of the deposits and\nsubstantially all of the assets of First\nRepublic Bank. As a result, Bank of\nAmerica has become a depositor of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank with regard to its\n$5 billion uninsured deposit originally\ndeposited into First Republic Bank.\n\nThe potential impacts of rising interest\nrates and continued deposit outflows on\nglobal markets , financial institutions\nand macroeconomic conditions, generally,\nremain uncertain. Episodes of increased\neconomic and market volatility may\ncontinue to occur and could worsen if\nthere are additional instances of actual\nor threatened bank failures, which could\nadversely affect the Corporation\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates\nThe Corporation and the global financial\nmarkets continue to make progress with\nrespect to the transition away from the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\nand other Interbank Offered Rates\n(IBORs) to alternative reference rates\n(ARRs). As previously disclosed, the\nremaining U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR\nsettings (i.e., overnight, one month,\nthree month, six month and 12 month)\nwill cease or become non-representative\nimmediately after June 30, 2023,\nalthough the Financial Conduct Authority\n(FCA) announced on April 3, 2023 that it\nwill require LIBOR\u2019s administrator, ICE\nBenchmark Administration Limited, to\ncontinue publication of the one-month,\nthree-month and six-month USD LIBOR\nsettings on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis\n(calculated using the relevant CME Term\nSOFR Reference Rate plus the respective\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (ISDA) fixed spread\nadjustment) for use in legacy contracts\nand that it intends for such publication\nto cease on September 30, 2024. In April\n2023, certain central counterparties\n(CCPs) completed processes to convert\ncertain outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared\nderivatives to ARR positions, and the\nCorporation expects those CCPs will\nconvert remaining USD LIBOR-cleared\nderivatives to ARR positions in the\nsecond quarter of 2023. In March 2023,\nthe Corporation announced that after\nJune 30, 2023, the relevant CME Term\nSOFR Reference Rate, plus the respective\nISDA fixed spread adjustment, will be\nthe replacement reference rate for\ncertain outstanding floating rate and\nfixed-to-floating rate debt securities,\npreferred stock represented by\ndepositary shares and trust preferred\nsecurities issued by the Corporation,\nBofA Finance LLC and certain other\naffiliated issuers (USD LIBOR\nSecurities) that use USD LIBOR as the\nreference rate and are governed by New\nYork and Delaware law. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s\nreplacement of relevant USD LIBOR rates\nof certain USD LIBOR Securities, see the\nCorporation\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K\nfiled with the SEC on March 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, as the Corporation\ncontinues to transition IBOR-based\nproducts to various ARRs, including the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR),\nit has increased the use of those ARRs\nin its baseline forecast of net interest\nincome. For more information, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 40.

Total\nliabilities increased $136.3 billion\nfrom December 31, 2022 to $2.9 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher securities\nfinancing activity and short-term\nborrowings to support balance sheet and\nliquidity positioning, partially offset\nby lower deposits primarily due to\ncustomers\u2019 movement of balances to\nhigher yielding investment alternatives.\nShareholders\u2019 equity increased $7.0\nbillion from December 31, 2022 primarily\ndue to net income and market value\nincreases on derivatives, partially\noffset by returns of capital to\nshareholders through common and\npreferred stock dividends and common\nstock repurchases.

Net interest\nyield on a fully taxable-equivalent\n(FTE) basis increased 51 basis points\n(bps) to 2.20 percent. The increase was\nprimarily driven by benefits from higher\ninterest rates, including lower premium\namortization expense and loan growth,\npartially offset by lower net interest\nincome related to Global Markets\nactivity, higher rates paid on deposits\nand lower debt securities.

Provision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $901 million to $931 million\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2023 compared to the same period in\n2022. The provision for credit losses\nfor the current-year period was driven\nby our consumer portfolio primarily due\nto higher-than-expected credit card\nbalances, partially offset by certain\nimproved macroeconomic conditions that\nprimarily benefited our commercial\nportfolio. The provision for credit\nlosses in the prior-year period was $30\nmillion, as asset quality improvement\nwas offset by a reserve build related to\nour Russian exposure and loan growth.\nFor more information on the provision\nfor credit losses, see Allowance for\nCredit Losses on page 36.

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\n\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 43.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends.

For more\ninformation about GWIM , see Business\nSegment Operations in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\n\nNet income for GWIM decreased $217\nmillion to $917 million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 compared to\nthe same period in 2022 primarily driven\nby lower revenue. The operating margin\nwas 23 percent compared to 27 percent a\nyear ago.\n\nNet interest income increased $208\nmillion to $1.9 billion due to the\nimpacts of higher interest rates and\nloan balances, partially offset by lower\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily\nincludes investment and brokerage\nservices income, decreased $369 million\nto $3.4 billion primarily due to the\nimpacts of lower market valuations and\ndeclines in AUM pricing, partially\noffset by the impact of positive AUM\nflows.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $52\nmillion to $4.1 billion primarily due to\ncontinued investments in the business,\nincluding strategic hiring and\ntechnology, largely offset by lower\nrevenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 20 percent, down from 26 percent,\ndue to lower net income and an increase\nin allocated capital. For more\ninformation on capital allocated to the\nbusiness segments, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 9.\n\nAverage loans increased $10.5 billion to\n$221.4 billion primarily due to\nresidential mortgages and custom\nlending, partially offset by securities-\nbased lending. Average deposits\ndecreased $70.9 billion to $314.0\nbillion primarily driven by clients\nmoving deposits to higher yielding\ninvestment alternatives.\n\nMerrill Wealth Management revenue of\n$4.4 billion decreased four percent\nprimarily driven by the impact of lower\nmarket valuations and declines in AUM\npricing, partially offset by the impact\nof higher interest rates.\n\nBank of America Private Bank revenue of\n$918 million increased three percent\nprimarily driven by the benefits of\nhigher interest rates, partially offset\nby the impact of lower market\nvaluations.\n

partially offset\nby the impact of lower deposit balances\nand treasury service charges. Average\nloans and leases increased seven percent\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2023 due to client demand. Average\ndeposits decreased nine percent due to\ndeclines in domestic balances.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile against our risk appetite\nand risk capacity. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

Based on the\nresults of our 2022 CCAR stress test, we\nare subject to a 3.4 percent stress\ncapital buffer (SCB) from October 1,\n2022 through September 30, 2023. In\nApril 2023, we submitted our 2023 CCAR\ncapital plan and related supervisory\nstress tests. The Federal Reserve has\nindicated that it will disclose CCAR\ncapital plan supervisory stress test\nresults by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized\nthe Corporation\u2019s $25 billion common\nstock repurchase program. Additionally,\nthe Board authorized common stock\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder the Corporation\u2019s equity-based\ncompensation plans. Pursuant to the\nBoard\u2019s authorizations, during the first\nquarter of 2023, we repurchased $2.2\nbillion of common stock, including\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder equity-based compensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The Corporation's\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated banking\nentity, BANA, are Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the PCA\nframework. As of March 31, 2023, the\nCommon equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital ratios under\nthe Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements are 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nand 9.5 percent under the Advanced\napproaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent from 2.5 percent on January 1,\n2024, which will increase our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement. At March\n31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s CET1 capital\nratio of 11.4 percent under the\nStandardized approach exceeded its\ncurrent CET1 capital ratio requirement\nas well as the minimum requirement\nexpected to be in place as of January 1,\n2024 due to the anticipated increase in\nour G-SIB surcharge.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  17Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 7 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The SLR\nregulatory minimum includes a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, CET1 capital was\n$184.4 billion, an increase of $4.4\nbillion from December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by dividends and common stock\nrepurchases. Tier 1 capital increased\n$4.4 billion primarily driven by the\nsame factors as CET1 capital. Total\ncapital under the Standardized approach\nincreased $4.0 billion primarily due to\nthe same factors driving the increase in\nTier 1 capital and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital, partially\noffset by a decrease in subordinated\n\ndebt. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at March 31, 2023,\nincreased $17.0 billion during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 to $1,622\nbillion primarily due to higher\ncounterparty exposures in Global Markets\n. Supplementary leverage exposure at\nMarch 31, 2023 increased $31.4 billion\nprimarily due to higher trading assets\nfrom increased business activities and\nhigher cash held at central banks,\npartially offset by lower derivative\nexposures and debt securities balances.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18

The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional\nClearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\nIncorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's\nprincipal European broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are Merrill Lynch\nInternational (MLI) and BofA Securities\nEurope SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its minimum capital\nrequirements as an alternative net\ncapital broker-dealer under Rule\n15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute\ntheir minimum capital requirements in\naccordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are\nalso registered as futures commission\nmerchants and are subject to Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nRegulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also registered with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nMarch 31, 2023, BofAS had tentative net\ncapital of $19.3 billion. BofAS also had\nregulatory net capital of $17.1 billion,\nwhich exceeded the minimum requirement\nof $4.5 billion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary\nof BofAS and provides clearing and\nsettlement services as well as prime\nbrokerage and arranged financing\nservices for institutional clients. At\nMarch 31, 2023, MLPCC\u2019s regulatory net\ncapital of $7.1 billion exceeded the\nminimum requirement of $1.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nMarch 31, 2023, MLPF&S' regulatory net\ncapital was $6.3 billion, which exceeded\nthe minimum requirement of $137 million.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\nis regulated by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the FCA and is\nsubject to certain regulatory capital\nrequirements. At\n\nMarch 31, 2023, MLI\u2019s capital resources\nwere $33.5 billion, which exceeded the\nminimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.7\nbillion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution\nwith its head office located in France,\nis regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the\nAutorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and\nsupervised under the Single Supervisory\nMechanism by the European Central Bank.\nAt March 31, 2023, BofASE's capital\nresources were $9.1 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $3.3 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became\nconditionally registered with the SEC as\nsecurity-based swap dealers in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, and maintained\nnet liquid assets at March 31, 2023 that\nexceeded the applicable minimum\nrequirements under the Exchange Act.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity Risk                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur primary liquidity risk management\nobjective is to meet expected or\nunexpected cash flow and collateral\nrequirements, including payments under\nlong-term debt agreements, commitments\nto extend credit and customer deposit\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support\nour businesses and customers under a\nrange of economic conditions. To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nstress from increased volatility due to\nthe failure of certain financial\ninstitutions in March 2023. For more\ninformation, see Executive Summary \u2013\nRecent Developments \u2013 Financial Market\nEvents on page 3. Our practices have\nalso allowed us to effectively manage\nmarket fluctuations from the rising\ninterest rate environment, inflationary\npressures and changes in the\nmacroeconomic environment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding and\nliquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.

NB Holdings\nCorporation Bank of America Corporation,\nas the parent company (the Parent),\nwhich is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, has an intercompany\narrangement with our wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary, NB Holdings\nCorporation (NB Holdings). We have\ntransferred, and agreed to transfer,\nadditional Parent assets not required to\nsatisfy anticipated near-term\nexpenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent\nis expected to continue to have access\nto the same flow of dividends, interest\nand other amounts of cash necessary to\nservice its debt, pay dividends and\nperform other obligations as it would\nhave had it not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets.\nThese arrangements support our preferred\nsingle point of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the Parent\nwould be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity\nSources and Other Unencumbered Assets We\nmaintain liquidity available to the\nCorporation, including the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, in the form of\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of assets\nthat are readily available to the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, including\nholding company, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash is primarily\non deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent, central banks\noutside of the U.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and other investment-grade\nsecurities, and a select group of\nnon-U.S. government securities. We can\nobtain cash for these securities, even\nin stressed conditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or outright sales.\nWe hold our GLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the liquidity\nrequirements of our global businesses,\nand we consider the impact of potential\nregulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 12 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 12          Average Global            Three Months                        \n  (Dollars in       Liquidity                        Ended           December 31  \n  billions)         Sources                  March 31 2023                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                        $               683    $              694  \n  Nonbank and                                                                     \n  other                                                171                   174  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               854    $              868  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental\n\nliquidity by pledging a range of\nunencumbered loans and securities to\ncertain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)\nand the Federal Reserve Discount Window.\nThe cash we could have obtained by\nborrowing against this pool of\nspecifically-identified eligible assets\nwas $319 billion and $348 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We\nhave established operational procedures\nto enable us to borrow against these\nassets, including regularly monitoring\nour total pool of eligible loans and\nsecurities collateral. Eligibility is\ndefined in guidelines from the FHLBs and\nthe Federal Reserve and is subject to\nchange at their discretion. Due to\nregulatory restrictions, liquidity\ngenerated by the bank subsidiaries can\ngenerally be used only to fund\nobligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 13 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n                    Average Global            Three Months                        \n  Table 13          Liquidity                        Ended                        \n  (Dollars in       Sources                       March 31           December 31  \n  billions)         Composition                       2023                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                              $               204    $              174  \n  deposit                                                                         \n  U.S. Treasury                                        225                   252  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-back\u2026                                                                  \n  securities,                                          411                   427  \n  and other                                                                       \n  investment-gr\u2026                                                                  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                            14                    15  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               854    $              868  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR) rules.

The\nrequirement is intended to support the\nability of banks to lend to households\nand businesses in both normal and\nadverse economic conditions and is\ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses\non short-term liquidity risks. The U.S.\nNSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. At March 31,\n2023, the Corporation and its insured\ndepository institutions were in\ncompliance with this requirement.\n                                                                                  \n  Diversified Funding Sources                                                     \n                                                                                  \nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix\nof deposits, and secured and unsecured\nliabilities through a centralized,\nglobally\n\ncoordinated funding approach diversified\nacross products, programs, markets,\ncurrencies and investor groups. We fund\na substantial portion of our lending\nactivities through our deposits, which\nwere $1.91 trillion and $1.93 trillion\nat March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nOur trading activities in other\nregulated entities are primarily funded\non a secured basis through securities\nlending and repurchase agreements, and\nthese amounts will vary based on\ncustomer activity and market conditions.\n                                                                                  \n  Deposits                                                                        \n                                                                                  \nOur deposit base is well-diversified by\nclients, geography and product type\nacross our business segments. At March\n31,\n\n2023, 55 percent of our deposits were in\nConsumer Banking , 16 percent in GWIM\nand 26 percent in Global Banking . We\nconsider a substantial portion of our\ndeposit base to be a stable, low-cost\nand consistent source of liquidity. At\nMarch 31, 2023, approximately 67 percent\nof consumer and small business deposits\nand 80 percent of U.S. deposits in\nGlobal Banking were held by clients who\nhave had accounts with us for 10 or more\nyears. In addition, at March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, 33 percent and 34\npercent of our deposits were\nnoninterest-bearing and included\noperating accounts of our consumer and\ncommercial clients. Deposits at March\n31, 2023 decreased $19.9 billion, or one\npercent, from December 31, 2022\nprimarily due to clients in GWIM moving\ndeposits into higher yielding investment\nalternatives. Period-end deposits for\nConsumer Banking and Global Banking were\nrelatively stable at March 31, 2023\ncompared to December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Long-term Debt                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023, we issued $14.3 billion of long-\nterm debt consisting of $3.8 billion of\nnotes issued by Bank of America\nCorporation, which were largely TLAC\ncompliant, $4.4 billion of notes issued\nby Bank of America, N.A. and $6.1\nbillion of other debt.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023, we had total long-term debt\nmaturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $11.3 billion consisting of\n$8.9 billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $500 million for Bank of\nAmerica, N.A. and $1.9 billion of other\ndebt.

We\ntypically hedge the returns we are\nobligated to pay on these liabilities\nwith derivatives and/or investments in\nthe underlying instruments, so that from\na funding perspective, the cost is\nsimilar to our other unsecured long-term\ndebt. We could be required to settle\ncertain structured note obligations for\ncash or other securities prior to\nmaturity under certain circumstances,\nwhich we consider for liquidity planning\npurposes. We believe, however, that a\nportion of such borrowings will remain\noutstanding beyond the earliest put or\nredemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price.

S&P concurrently changed\nits outlooks on three other large U.S.\nbank holding companies to Stable from\nPositive, noting that the agency has\nreduced its upside expectations for bank\nratings in the near term.\n\nOn January 23, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService (Moody\u2019s) placed the long-term\nrating of the Corporation as well as the\nlong-term rating of its rated\nsubsidiaries, including BANA, on review\nfor upgrade. The agency cited the\nCorporation\u2019s strengthened capital\nratios, improved earnings profile and\ncontinued commitment to maintaining a\nrestrained risk appetite as drivers of\nthe review. Moody\u2019s concurrently\naffirmed all Prime-1 short-term ratings\nof the Corporation and rated\nsubsidiaries. A review for upgrade\nindicates that those ratings are under\nconsideration for a change in the near\nterm and typically concludes within 90\ndays. As of May 1, 2023, Moody\u2019s had not\nyet announced the completion of its\nreview of the long-term ratings.\n\nFor more information on additional\ncollateral and termination payments that\ncould be required in connection with\ncertain over-the-counter derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements\nin the event of a credit rating\ndowngrade, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements\nherein and Item 1A.

Uncertainty remains\nregarding broader economic impacts as a\nresult of inflationary pressures, rising\nrates and the current geopolitical\nenvironment and could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality metrics in\nfuture periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics\n\nto quantify and balance risks and\nreturns. Statistical models are built\nusing detailed behavioral information\nfrom external sources, such as credit\nbureaus, and/or internal historical\nexperience and are a component of our\nconsumer credit risk management process.\nThese models are used in part to assist\nin making both new and ongoing credit\ndecisions as well as portfolio\nmanagement strategies, including\nauthorizations and line management,\ncollection practices and strategies, and\ndetermination of the allowance for loan\nand lease losses and allocated capital\nfor credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable and home\nprices continued to decline modestly.\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023, net charge-offs increased $313\nmillion to $653 million compared to the\nsame period in 2022, as late-stage\ndelinquent credit card loans were\ncharged off.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses increased $124 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2023 to $7.4 billion.

balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\ndecreased $42 million during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 primarily\ndue to returns to performing and\npaydowns outpacing new additions. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat March 31, 2023, $1.3 billion, or 63\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more decreased $120 million.\n\nOf the $217.4 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat March 31, 2023, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period was $3.4\nbillion, or six percent, at March 31,\n2023. Residential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization period\ngenerally experience a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At March 31, 2023, $64 million,\nor two percent, of outstanding interest-\nonly residential mortgages that had\nentered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $724 million, or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\n\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2023, $185 million, or five\npercent, of outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $67 million were\ncontractually current. Loans that have\nyet to enter the amortization period in\nour interest-only residential mortgage\nportfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of 3 to 10 years.\nApproximately 96 percent of these loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n\nTable 19 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nof outstandings at both March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022.

Accruing\nloans that were 30 days or more past due\nremained relatively unchanged during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nNet recoveries decreased $18 million to\n$12 million during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 compared to the\nsame period in 2022.\n\nOf the $25.9 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at March\n31, 2023, as shown in Table 20, 12\npercent require interest-only payments.\nThe outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhad reached the end of their draw period\nand\n\nentered the amortization period was $4.9\nbillion at March 31, 2023. The HELOCs\nthat have entered the amortization\nperiod have experienced a higher\npercentage of early stage delinquencies\nand nonperforming status when compared\nto the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At\nMarch 31, 2023, $50 million, or one\npercent, of outstanding HELOCs that had\nentered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more. In\naddition, at March 31, 2023, $329\nmillion, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, 23 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 21 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 29, 31 and 34 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio.

Many commercial real\nestate markets are still experiencing\ndisruptions in demand, supply chain\nchallenges, tenant difficulties and\nchallenging capital markets. Recent\ndemand for office space has been\nstagnant, and future demand for office\nspace continues to be uncertain as\ncompanies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $292 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2023 to $5.2 billion, primarily driven\nby certain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 36.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure decreased $4.2 billion during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023 to\n$700.7 billion primarily driven by lower\nderivative assets, partially offset by\nhigher loans and leases.

During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, nonperforming commercial\nloans and leases increased $150 million\nto $1.2 billion. At March 31, 2023, 97\npercent of commercial nonperforming\nloans, leases and foreclosed properties\nwere secured, and 58 percent were\ncontractually current. Commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at 84\npercent of their unpaid principal\nbalance, as the carrying value of these\nloans has been reduced to the estimated\ncollateral value less costs to sell.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America32                                                               \n

To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in\nour credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $9.8 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $77 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 compared to net losses of $9 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were\nlargely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk\n(VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio\ninformation in Table 37. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page\n38.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal\n\ncourse of business through credit,\nmarket and operational risk governance\nrather than through country risk\ngovernance.

The\ndecline was driven by decreased exposure\nacross a mix of clients offset by\nincreased net\n\ncounterparty exposure with central\nclearing counterparties. Our second\nlargest non-U.S. country exposure was\nGermany with net exposure of $36.1\nbillion at March 31, 2023, a decrease of\n$9.6 billion from December 31, 2022.

The decrease in the allowance\nreflected a reserve release in our\ncommercial portfolio primarily driven by\ncertain improved macroeconomic\nconditions, partially offset by a\nreserve build in our consumer portfolio\nprimarily due to higher-than-expected\ncredit card balances during the three\n\nmonths ended March 31, 2023. The\ndecrease in allowance also includes the\nimpact of the accounting change to\nremove the recognition and measurement\nguidance on TDRs, which reduced the\nallowance for credit losses by $243\nmillion.

three months\nended March 31, 2023 were $807 million\nand increased $415 million, or 106\npercent, compared to $392 million for\nthe same period in 2022 primarily driven\nby credit card losses increasing off of\nhistoric lows and higher overdraft\nlosses due to an increase in industry-\nwide check fraud activity. The provision\nfor credit losses increased $901 million\nto $931 million for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 compared to the\nsame period in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 was driven by our\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\nhigher-than-expected credit card\nbalances during the first quarter of\n2023. This was partially offset by\ncertain improved macroeconomic\nconditions that primarily benefited our\ncommercial portfolio. The provision for\ncredit losses for the consumer\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, increased $932 million to\n$946 million for the three months\n\nended March 31, 2023 compared to the\nsame period in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the commercial\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, decreased $165 million to\n$149 million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 compared to the same\nperiod in 2022.\n\nTable 36 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022.

For more information on market\nrisks, see the Market section within\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 37 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and\n\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio\nand the fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 37 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 37 presents period-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022\nusing a 99 percent confidence level. The\namounts disclosed in Table 37 and Table\n38 align to the view of covered\npositions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations.

Table 40 shows the\npretax impact to forecasted net interest\nincome over the next 12 months from\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nresulting from instantaneous parallel\nand non-parallel shocks to the market-\nbased forward curve. Periodically, we\nevaluate the scenarios presented so that\nthey are meaningful in the context of\nthe current rate environment. The\ninterest rate scenarios also assume U.S.\ndollar interest rates are floored at\nzero.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023, the overall decrease in asset\nsensitivity of our balance sheet to\nhigher and lower rate scenarios was\nprimarily due to changes in deposit\nproduct mix and risk management\nactivities performed in our ALM\nportfolio to respond to changing market\nconditions. We continue to be asset\nsensitive to a parallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the majority of that\nimpact coming from the short end of the\nyield curve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates negatively impact the\nfair value of our debt securities\nclassified as available for sale and\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America40                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in alternate\ninterest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 40 assumes no change\nin deposit portfolio size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios,\nthe increase in net interest income\nwould be impacted by any customer\nactivity resulting in the replacement of\nlow-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits\nwith higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding as our benefit in those\nscenarios would be reduced. Conversely,\nin lower-rate scenarios, any customer\nactivity that results in the replacement\nof higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits would\nreduce our exposure in those scenarios.\n\nFor interest rate scenarios larger than\n100 bps shifts, it is expected that the\ninterest rate sensitivity will\nillustrate non-linear behaviors as there\nare numerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing\nwill have non-linear impacts to larger\nshort-end rate movements. In decreasing\ninterest rate scenarios, and\nparticularly where interest rates have\ndecreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced\nas customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit\npricing will likely increase at a faster\nrate, leading to incremental interest\nexpense and reducing asset sensitivity.\nWhile the impact related to the above\nassumptions used in the asset\nsensitivity analysis can provide\ndirectional analysis on how net interest\nincome will be impacted in changing\nenvironments, the ultimate impact is\ndependent upon the interrelationship of\nthe assumptions and factors, which vary\nin different macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 40.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives\n\nin accounting hedges to manage\nsubstantially all of the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations.\nBy hedging the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in\nthis area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on\nIRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThere were no significant gains or\nlosses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the hedge portfolio,\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022. For more information on\nMSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the physical impacts of climate\nchange, driven by extreme weather events\nsuch as hurricanes and floods, as well\nas chronic longer-term shifts such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels, and (2) risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\nThese changes and events may have broad\nimpacts on operations, supply chains,\ndistribution networks, customers and\nmarkets and are otherwise referred to,\nrespectively, as physical risk and\ntransition risk. These risks may impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. Physical climate events may lead\nto increased credit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or\ncollateral value, or increased\noperational risk by impacting the\nCorporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\ncustomers or vendors. Climate-related\ntransition changes in policy, technology\nor the market may amplify credit risk\nthrough financial impacts to the\nCorporation or its customers or\ncounterparties or increase market risk,\nincluding through sudden price\nadjustments. In addition, reputational\nrisk may arise, including from our\nclimate-related practices, disclosures\nand commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAs climate risk spans all key risk\ntypes, we have developed and continue to\nenhance processes to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into our Risk Framework\nand risk management programs established\nfor each of our seven key types of risk.\n\nWe publicly announced our commitment to\nachieve net zero emissions in our\nfinancing activities, operations, and\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal). In connection with our Net Zero\nGoal, we set certain 2030 targets,\nincluding reducing emissions associated\nwith our operations and financing\nactivities, related to auto\nmanufacturing, energy and power\ngeneration, and for our supply chain,\nincluding that a certain proportion of\nour global suppliers set their own\nclimate targets (2030 Targets). We\ndisclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed\nemission and emission intensity metrics\nfor the above referenced sectors in our\n2022 Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) Report,\nwith 2019 serving as the baseline for\nour financed emissions targets.\n\nWe plan to disclose the financed\nemissions for additional portions of our\nbusiness loan portfolio in 2023, and we\nplan to set financing activity emission\nreduction targets for other key sectors\nby April 2024.\n\nAchieving our climate-related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero Goal and\n2030 Targets, may require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, new standards and\npublic policies, including those that\nimprove the cost of capital for the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well\nas ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith customers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.\n\nGiven the extended period of these and\nother climate-related goals we have\nestablished, our initiatives have not\nresulted in a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\nposition in the relevant periods\npresented herein.\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework and climate risk management\nprocess, see the Managing Risk and\nClimate Risk Management sections in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such that the\nresults of any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current-\nperiod presentation. New Accounting\nStandard Issued Investments \u2013 Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures The FASB\nupdated its guidance on the accounting\nfor tax credit investments, which\npermits entities to make an accounting\npolicy election to apply the\nproportional amortization method\n\nwhen certain conditions are met. The new\naccounting guidance is effective on a\nretrospective or modified retrospective\nbasis beginning on January 1, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted. If adopted,\nthe Corporation does not expect the\nguidance to have a material impact on\nits consolidated financial position or\nresults of operations. New Accounting\nStandard Adopted Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses On January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting\nand disclosure requirements for expected\ncredit losses (ECL) that removed the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and\nadded disclosures on the financial\neffect and subsequent performance of\ncertain types of modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Upon adoption of the\nstandard, the Corporation recorded a\nreduction of $ 243million in the\nallowance for credit losses for the\nimpact of changes in the methodology\nused to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses for non-collateral\ndependent consumer and commercial TDRs.\nThere was no impact to the valuation of\nloans previously classified as\ncollateral-dependent TDRs. After\nadjusting for deferred taxes, the\nCorporation recorded an increase of $\n184million in retained earnings through\na cumulative-effect adjustment. The\nadditional disclosures are included in\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses on a\nprospective basis and include loan\nmodifications where the contractual\npayment terms of the borrower\u2019s loan\nagreement were modified through a\nrefinancing or restructuring.\nModifications that do not impact the\ncontractual payment terms, such as\ncovenant waivers, insignificant payment\ndeferrals, and any modifications made to\nloans carried at fair value, loans held-\nfor-sale (LHFS) and leases are not\nincluded in the disclosures. The\nCorporation uses various indicators to\nidentify borrowers in financial\ndifficulty. Consumer loan borrowers that\nare delinquent and commercial loan\nborrowers that are rated substandard or\nworse are the primary criteria used to\nidentify borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. If a borrower is\ncurrent at the time of modification, the\nloan generally remains a performing loan\nas long as there is demonstrated\nperformance prior to the modification,\nand payment in full under the modified\nterms is expected. Otherwise, the loan\nis placed on nonaccrual status and\nreported as nonperforming, excluding\nfully-insured consumer real estate\nloans, until there is sustained\nrepayment performance for a reasonable\nperiod. The allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for modified loans is determined\nin a manner consistent with the\nmethodology for the respective class and\ncredit rating of the financing\nreceivable as described in Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America48                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                               \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022.

At March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these\nhedging relationships was $ 21.1billion and $ 21.4billion, of which $ 9.3billion\nand $ 9.2billion were designated in a portfolio layer hedging relationship. At\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the cumulative adjustment associated with\nthese hedging relationships was a decrease of $ 329million and $ 451million.\n(4) Carrying value represents amortized cost.\n(5) Represents hedging activities related to certain commodities inventory.\nCash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below summarizes certain information\nrelated to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022. Of the $ 9.9billion after-tax net loss ($ 13.2billion\npretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at March 31, 2023, losses of $\n4.4billion after-tax ($ 5.9billion pretax) related to both open and terminated\ncash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12\nmonths. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily\ndecrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash\nflow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are\nhedged is approximately seven years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time\nperiod over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest\nincome is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time\nperiod being insignificant.\n                                                                                  \n  Ga\u2026

At both March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 4.8billion of non-U.S.\ngovernment-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received\ngross cash proceeds of $ 4.9billion at\nthe transfer dates. At both March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of the transferred securities was\n$ 4.7billion. Sales and Trading Revenue\nThe Corporation enters into trading\nderivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk\nexposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.

These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n95.5billion and $ 101.3billion and\nposted cash and securities collateral of\n$ 83.1billion and $ 81.2billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends\non the contract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. At March 31, 2023, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the\nterms of the contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain subsidiaries\ncould be required to post to\ncounterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.2billion,\nincluding $ 2.2billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National Association (BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able\nto unilaterally terminate certain\ncontracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take\nother action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases Commercial nonperforming loans\nincreased to $ 1.2billion at March 31, 2023 from $ 1.1billion at December 31,\n2022, driven by the commercial real estate office property type. Consumer\nnonperforming loans decreased to $ 2.7billion at March 31, 2023 from $ 2.8billion\nat December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loans as\nreturns to performing status and paydowns more than offset new additions.

At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 residential mortgage included $\n232million and $ 260million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 106million and $ 108million\nof loans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at March\n31, 2023.\n

Alternatively, the Corporation may\noffer the borrower a payment plan, which\nallows the borrower to repay past due\namounts through payments over a defined\nperiod. At March 31, 2023, the amortized\ncost of residential mortgage and home\nequity loans that were modified through\nthese plans during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 was $ 158million\nand $ 30million. The weighted-average\nduration of these modifications was\n8.2months and 8.9months. The total\nforborne payments for these\nmodifications was $ 7million and $\n3million for residential mortgage and\nhome equity loans. If a borrower is\nunable to fulfill their obligations\nunder the forbearance plans, they may be\noffered a trial or permanent\nmodification. Trial Modifications :\nTrial modification plans generally\nconsist of the Corporation offering a\nborrower modified loan terms that reduce\ntheir contractual payments temporarily\nover a three-to- four-monthtrial period.\nIf the customer successfully makes the\nmodified payments during the trial\nperiod and formally accepts the modified\nterms, the modified loan terms become\npermanent. At March 31, 2023, the\namortized cost of residential mortgage\nand home equity loans entering trial\nmodifications during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 was $ 21million and\n$ 9million.\n\nPermanent Modifications : Permanent\nmodifications include borrowers that\nhave completed a trial modification and\nhave had their contractual payment terms\npermanently modified, as well as\nborrowers that proceed directly to a\npermanent modification without a trial\nperiod. In a permanent modification, the\nborrower\u2019s payment terms are typically\nmodified in more than one manner but\ngenerally include a term extension and\nan interest rate reduction. At times,\nthe permanent modification may also\ninclude principal forgiveness and/or a\ndeferral of past due principal and\ninterest amounts to the end of the loan\nterm. The combinations utilized are\nbased on modifying the terms that give\nthe borrower an improved ability to meet\nthe contractual obligations. At March\n31, 2023, the amortized cost of\nresidential mortgage and home equity\nloans that were granted a permanent\nmodification during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 was $ 47million and\n$ 10million. The term extensions granted\nfor residential mortgage and home equity\npermanent modifications vary widely and\ncan be up to 30years, but are mostly in\nthe range of 1to 10years and 1to\n15years. The weighted-average term\nextension of permanent modifications for\nresidential mortgage and home equity\nloans was 7.7years and 12.1years, while\nthe weighted-average interest rate\nreduction was 1.50percent and\n2.37percent. Principal forgiveness and\npayment deferrals were insignificant for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023.\nFor consumer real estate borrowers in\nfinancial difficulty that received a\nforbearance, trial or permanent\nmodification, there were no commitments\nto lend additional funds at March 31,\n2023. Borrowers with a home equity line\nof credit that received a forbearance\nplan could have all or a portion of\ntheir lines reinstated in the future if\nthey cure their payment default and meet\ncertain Bank conditions. Chapter 7\nDischarges: If a borrower\u2019s consumer\nreal estate obligation is discharged in\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the\ncontractual payment terms of the loan\nare not modified, although they can no\nlonger be enforced against the\nindividual borrower. The Corporation\u2019s\nability to collect amounts due on the\nloan is limited to enforcement against\nthe property through the foreclosure and\nsale of the collateral. The Corporation\nwill only pursue foreclosure upon\ndefault by the borrower, and otherwise\nwill recover pursuant to the loan terms\nor at the time of a sale. Residential\nmortgage and home equity loans that were\ngranted a Chapter 7 discharge were\ninsignificant for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023. The Corporation tracks\nthe performance of modified loans to\nassess effectiveness of modification\nprograms.

The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including\nfully-insured loans, for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in process\nat March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nwas $ 819million and $ 871million.\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 37million and $ 56million\nof consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally\nFHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash\ninvesting activities and, accordingly,\nare not reflected in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and\nOther Consumer Credit card and other\nconsumer loans are primarily modified by\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment\nplan with a fixed interest rate. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, substantially all\npayment plans provided to customers had\na 60-month term. In certain\ncircumstances, the Corporation will\nforgive a portion of the outstanding\nbalance if the borrower makes payments\nup to a set amount. The Corporation\nmakes modifications directly with\nborrowers for loans held by the\nCorporation (internal programs) as well\nas through third-party renegotiation\nagencies that provide solutions to\ncustomers\u2019 entire unsecured debt\nstructures (external programs). The\nMarch 31, 2023 amortized cost of credit\ncard and other consumer loans that were\nmodified through these programs during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023\nwas $ 157million. The financial effect\nof modifications resulted in a weighted-\naverage interest rate reduction of\n18.65percent and principal forgiveness\nof $ 11million. The Corporation tracks\nthe performance of modified loans to\nassess the effectiveness of modification\nprograms. Defaults of modified credit\ncard and other consumer loans since\nJanuary 1, 2023 were insignificant\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2023. Of the $ 157million in modified\ncredit card and other consumer loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty as of March 31, 2023, $\n109million were current, $ 24million\nwere 30-89 days past due, and $\n24million were greater than 90 days past\ndue. These modifications represented\n0.08percent of outstanding credit card\nand other consumer loans at March 31,\n2023. Commercial Loans Modifications of\nloans to commercial borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing borrowers\nwith an opportunity to work through\nfinancial difficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique, reflects the\nborrower\u2019s individual circumstances and\nis designed to benefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk\nexposure. Commercial modifications are\nprimarily term extensions and payment\nforbearances. Payment forbearances\ninvolve the Bank forbearing its\ncontractual right to collect certain\npayments or payment in\n\nfull (maturity forbearance) for a\ndefined period of time. Reductions in\ninterest rates and principal forgiveness\noccur infrequently for commercial\nborrowers. Principal forgiveness may\noccur in connection with foreclosure,\nshort sales or other settlement\nagreements, leading to termination or\nsale of the loan. As of March 31, 2023,\nthe amortized cost basis of modified\ncommercial loans that were entered into\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2023 was $ 822million, including term\nextensions of $ 700million, forbearances\nof $ 102million and other miscellaneous\nmodifications of $ 20million. Term\nextensions granted during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 increased\nthe weighted-average life of the\nimpacted loans by 1.3years. The\nweighted-average duration of loan\npayments deferred under the\nCorporation\u2019s commercial loan\nforbearance program was 15months,\nsubstantially all of which were deferred\nover a range of 12to 24months. Of the $\n822million in modified Commercial loans\nto borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty as of March 31, 2023, $\n775million were current, $ 5million were\n30-89 days past due, and $ 42million\nwere greater than 90 days past due.\nThese modifications represented\n0.14percent of outstanding commercial\nloans at March 31, 2023. Defaults of\nmodified commercial loans since January\n1, 2023 were insignificant during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023. For\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023,\nthe Corporation had commitments to lend\n$ 534million to commercial borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty whose\nloans were modified during the period.\n\nPrior-period Troubled Debt Restructuring\nDisclosures Prior to adopting the new\naccounting standard on loan\nmodifications, the Corporation accounted\nfor modifications of loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty as\nTDRs, when the modification resulted in\na concession. The following discussion\nreflects loans that were considered TDRs\nprior to January 1, 2023. For more\ninformation on TDR accounting policies,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Consumer Real Estate The following\ntable presents the March 31, 2022 unpaid\nprincipal balance, carrying value, and\naverage pre- and post-modification\ninterest rates of consumer real estate\nloans that were modified in TDRs during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022.\nThe following Consumer Real Estate\nportfolio segment tables include loans\nthat were initially classified as TDRs\nduring the period and also loans that\nhad previously been classified as TDRs\nand were modified again during the\nperiod. Binding trial modifications are\nclassified as TDRs when the trial offer\nis made and continue to be classified as\nTDRs regardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification. At\nDecember 31, 2022, remaining commitments\nto lend additional funds to debtors\nwhose terms have been modified in a\nconsumer real estate TDR were not\nsignificant.\n

Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 10percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 17percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans During the three months\nended March 31, 2022 , the carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s commercial\nloans that were modified as TDRs was $\n848million. At December 31, 2022, the\nCorporation had commitments to lend $\n358million to commercial borrowers whose\nloans were classified as TDRs. The\nbalance of commercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 105million at December 31,\n2022. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $ 6.8billion and\n$ 6.9billion at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. Cash and non-cash\nproceeds from sales and paydowns of\nloans originally classified as LHFS were\n$ 2.4billion and $ 13.3billion for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022. Cash used for originations and\npurchases of LHFS totaled $ 2.3billion\nand $ 6.8billion for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022 . Also\nincluded were non-cash net transfers\ninto LHFS of $ 459million and $\n1.5billion for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022. Accrued\nInterest Receivable Accrued interest\nreceivable for loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022 was $ 4.0billion\nand $ 3.8billion and is reported in\ncustomer and other receivableson the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding\ncredit card loan balances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and fees. Credit\ncard loans are not classified as\nnonperforming but are charged off no\nlater than the end of the month in which\nthe account becomes 180 days past due,\nwithin 60 days after receipt of\nnotification of death or bankruptcy, or\nupon confirmation of fraud . During the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022, the Corporation reversed $\n118million and $ 131million of interest\nand fee income against the income\nstatement line item in which it was\noriginally recorded upon charge-off of\nthe principal balance of the loan. For\nthe outstanding residential mortgage,\nhome equity, direct/indirect consumer\nand commercial loan balances classified\nas nonperforming during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, interest\nand fee income reversed at the time the\nloans were classified as nonperforming\nwas not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The March 31, 2023 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic scenarios, including a\nbaseline scenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario\nreflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall economic outlook is weighted\n95percent towards a mild recessionary\nenvironment in 2023. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes that the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate will be above\nfivepercent by the fourth quarter of\n2023 and will remain near this level\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAdditionally, in this economic outlook,\nU.S. real gross domestic product is\nforecasted to contract at 0.5percent and\ngrow at 1.4percent year-over-year in the\nfourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For\ncomparison, as of December 31, 2022, the\nweighted economic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nto be just above five and a half percent\nby the fourth quarter of 2023 and slowly\ndecline to fivepercent by the fourth\nquarter of 2024 and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product was forecasted to\ncontract at 0.4percent and grow at\n1.2percent year-over-year in the fourth\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America70                                                               \n                                                                                  \nquarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively. In addition, as of March 31, 2023, the\nlatest estimate of the year-over-year real gross domestic product growth in the\nfourth quarter of 2022 was 0.9percent. For comparison, as of December 31, 2022,\nthe year-over-year baseline real gross domestic product growth in the fourth\nquarter of 2022 was forecasted at 0.4percent. The allowance for credit losses\ndecreased $ 271million from December 31, 2022 to $ 14.0billion at March 31, 2023,\nwhich included a $ 123million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio\nand a $ 394million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The\ndecrease in the allowance reflected a reserve release in our commercial portfolio\nprimarily driven by certain improved macroeconomic conditions, partially offset by\na reserve build in our consumer portfolio primarily due to higher-than-expected\ncredit card balances during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in\nallowance also includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on TDRs, which reduced the allowance for\ncredit losses by $ 243million. The change in the allowance for credit losses was\ncomprised of a net decrease of $ 168million in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and a decrease of $ 103million in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to\ndecreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 394million and the consumer real estate\nportfolio of $ 18million, partially offset by an increase in the credit card and\nother consumer portfolios of $ 141million. The provision for credit losses\nincreased $ 901million to $ 931million for the three months ended March 31, 2023\ncompared to the same period in 2022. The provision for credit losses for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to\nhigher-than-expected credit card balances during the first quarter of 2023. This\nwas partially offset by certain improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily\nbenefited our commercial portfolio. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans\naccounted for under the fair value option increased $ 2.0billion during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by commercial loans, which increased\n$ 6.3billion driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans, which decreased $\n4.2billion primarily driven by securities-based lending and credit card.

The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n98.3billion and $ 110.4billion at March 31, 2023 and 2022. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 69million and $ 70million during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Servicing advances on serviced loans,\nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n1.5billion and $ 1.6billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

net of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans and leases in the consolidated\ncredit card trust included $ 4.7billion and $ 3.3billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines\n                                                                                  \n  73Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nof credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing\nof related cash flows. Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation securitizes\noriginated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables,\nretaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and\nholding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests in accrued\ninterest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts. No new\nsenior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. At\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation held subordinate securities\nissued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of\n$ 4.7billion and $ 6.7billion. These securities serve as a form of credit\nenhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent. No subordinate securities were issued by the credit card\nsecuritization trust during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\nResecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into\nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities\nwith specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing\nactivities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the\nunilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $\n1.6billion and $ 9.5billion of securities during the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar\nactivities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale\nwas recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n586million and $ 699million, of which substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets for both periods. Substantially all of the\ntrading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers\nmunicipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal\nbonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates\nthat reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts,\nincluding those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $ 2.5billion at\nboth March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of\nbonds held in the trusts at March 31, 2023 was 11.0years. There were no\nsignificant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

been revised to include unconsolidated CLOs.\nCustomer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-\nlinked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically\ncreated on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a\nspecific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation\u2019s\ninvolvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n1.0billion and $ 914million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including the\nnotional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of\nlosses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs. Total assets of the consolidated and unconsolidated\nVIEs were $ 1.5billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. CDO and CLO\nVIEs The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated CDO and CLO VIEs, that\nhold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt, ABS\nor non-investment grade corporate loans, which are funded by multiple tranches of\ndebt instruments and equity securities issued by the VIEs. The VIEs are managed by\nthird-party portfolio managers. The Corporation holds $ 16.3billion of loans and\nsecurities issued by CDO and CLO VIEs at both March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. The Corporation\u2019s loss exposure is limited to its loan and debt security\nholdings and the notional amount of any derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated CDOs and CLOs totaled $ 16.3billion at both March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, which is insignificant to the total assets of the VIEs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America74                                                               \n                                                                                  \nInvestment VIEs The Corporation\nsponsors, invests in or provides\nfinancing, which may be in connection\nwith the sale of assets, to a variety of\ninvestment VIEs that hold loans, real\nestate, debt securities or other\nfinancial instruments and are designed\nto provide the desired investment\nprofile to investors or the Corporation.\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $\n454million and $ 854million. The\nCorporation also held investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 15.1billion and $ 12.2billion at March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure\nassociated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $\n2.2billion and $ 2.4billion at March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 comprised\nprimarily of on-balance sheet assets\nless non-recourse liabilities. Leveraged\nLease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net\ninvestment in consolidated leveraged\nlease trusts totaled $ 1.2billion at\nboth March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. The trusts hold long-lived\nequipment such as rail cars, power\ngeneration and distribution equipment,\nand commercial aircraft. The Corporation\nstructures the trusts and holds a\nsignificant residual interest. The net\ninvestment represents the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged\nlease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is\nnon-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds equity\ninvestments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that\nconstruct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain\nother projects. The total assets of\nthese unconsolidated tax credit VIEs\nwere $ 76.0billion and $ 74.8billion as\nof March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nAn unrelated third party is typically\nthe general partner or managing member\nand has control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. As an investor,\ntax credits associated with the\ninvestments in these entities are\nallocated to the Corporation, as\nprovided by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nCode and related regulations, and are\nrecognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of\nIncome in the year they are earned,\nwhich varies based on the type of\ninvestments. Tax credits from\nenvironmental, social and governance\n(ESG) investments in affordable housing\nare recognized ratably over a term of up\nto 10 years, and tax credits from\nrenewable energy investments are\nrecognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax\nCredits (ITCs) or as energy is produced\nfor transactions electing Production Tax\nCredits (PTCs), which is generally up to\na 10-year time period. The volume and\ntypes of investments held by the\nCorporation will influence the amount of\ntax credits recognized each period. The\nCorporation\u2019s equity investments in\naffordable housing and other projects\ntotaled $ 14.7billion at both March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, which\nincluded unfunded capital contributions\nof $ 7.0billion and $ 6.9billion and are\nprobable to be paid over the next five\nyears. The Corporation may be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant. During the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefits related to affordable\nhousing and other tax credit equity\ninvestments of $ 527million and $\n419million and reported pretax losses in\nother income of\n\n$ 372million and $ 337million. The\nCorporation\u2019s equity investments in\nrenewable energy totaled $ 14.1billion\nand $ 13.9billion at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. In addition, the\nCorporation had unfunded capital\ncontributions for renewable energy\ninvestments of $ 5.6billion and $\n1.9billion at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, which are contingent\non various conditions precedent to\nfunding over the next two years. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk of loss is generally\nmitigated by policies requiring the\nproject to qualify for the expected tax\ncredits prior to making its investment.\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Corporation\nrecognized tax credits and other tax\nbenefits related to renewable energy\nequity investments of $ 996million and $\n865million and reported pretax losses in\nother income of $ 561million and $\n530million. The Corporation may also\nenter into power purchase agreements\nwith renewable energy tax credit\nentities. The maximum loss exposure for\ntax credit VIEs was $ 28.8billion at\nboth March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.

The primary source of this\ncollateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell.\nFor more information on collateral, see\nNote 10 \u2013 Securities Financing\nAgreements, Short-term Borrowings,\nCollateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within\ncash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet of $\n6.5billion and $ 7.6billion,\npredominantly related to cash segregated\nin compliance with securities\nregulations and cash held on deposit\nwith central banks to meet reserve\nrequirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nCredit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.1billion and $ 10.4billion at\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThe carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncredit extension commitments at March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nexcluding commitments accounted for\nunder the fair value option, was $\n1.5billion and $ 1.6billion, which\npredominantly related to the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these commitments is\nclassified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Legally binding commitments to\nextend credit generally have specified\nrates and maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The table below includes\nthe notional amount of commitments of $\n3.1billion and $ 3.0billion at March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 122million and $\n110million at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, which is classified\nin accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

31, 2023, and $ 25.1billion and $ 9.5billion at December 31,\n2022. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 563million and $ 575million\nat March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 749million and $ 636million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 226million and $ 294million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Corporation had commitments to enter\ninto resale and forward-dated resale and\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $\n116.5billion and $ 92.0billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated\nrepurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 90.1billion and $\n57.8billion. These commitments generally\nexpire within the next 12months. At\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Corporation had a commitment to\noriginate or purchase up to $ 4.1billion\nand $ 3.7billion on a rolling 12-month\nbasis, of auto loans and leases from a\nstrategic partner. This commitment\nextends through November 2026 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice.\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Corporation had unfunded equity\ninvestment commitments of $ 534million\nand $ 571million. Other Guarantees Bank-\nowned Life Insurance Book Value\nProtection The Corporation sells\nproducts that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who\noffer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At both\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe notional amount of these guarantees\ntotaled $ 4.3billion. At March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure related to these\nguarantees totaled $ 633million and $\n632million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant\nServices The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of\nother merchant acquirers may be held\nliable for any reversed charges that\ncannot be collected from the merchants,\ndue to, among other things, merchant\nfraud or insolvency. If charges are\nproperly reversed after a purchase and\ncannot be collected from either the\nmerchants or merchant acquirers, the\nCorporation may be held liable for these\nreversed charges. The ability to reverse\na charge is primarily governed by the\napplicable payment network rules and\nregulations, which include, but are not\nlimited to, the type of charge, type of\npayment used and time limits. The total\namount of transactions subject to\nreversal under payment network rules and\nregulations processed for the preceding\nsix-month period, which was\napproximately $ 470billion, is an\nestimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum\npotential exposure as of March 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk in this area\nprimarily relates to circumstances where\na cardholder has purchased goods or\nservices for future delivery. The\nCorporation mitigates this risk by\nrequiring cash deposits, guarantees,\nletters of credit or other types of\ncollateral from certain merchants. The\nCorporation\u2019s reserves for contingent\nlosses and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were\nnot significant. Representations and\nWarranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees,\nsee Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 622million and $\n612million at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and\nthe related provision is included in\nother\n\nincome in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. The representations and\nwarranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of probable\nincurred losses, is based on its\nexperience in previous negotiations, and\nis subject to judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations\nand warranties losses may occur in\nexcess of the amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does\nnot expect such amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's financial condition\nand liquidity. See Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible\nloss in excess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 46.7billion and $ 59.6billion at\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities issued by certain\nstatutory trust companies that are\n100percent owned finance subsidiaries of\nthe Corporation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nrelated to each pending matter. As a\nmatter develops, the Corporation, in\nconjunction with any outside counsel\nhandling the matter, evaluates whether\nsuch matter presents a loss contingency\nthat is probable and estimable, and, for\nthe matters disclosed below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n89million and $ 106million was\nrecognized for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nfor which a loss in future periods is\nreasonably possible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued\nliability) and for representations and\nwarranties exposures, the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 0.8billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of March\n31, 2023. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure regarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities, management\ndoes not believe that loss contingencies\narising from pending matters, including\nthe matters described below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, will have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the\nsignificant judgment, variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties involved\nin those matters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and\nthe very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm.\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessment On April\n10, 2023, the magistrate judge issued a\nreport and recommendation (the Report)\nfor resolving the parties\u2019 pending\nsummary judgment motions. The Report\nrecommends granting the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\u2019s (FDIC) motion\nfor summary judgment on BANA\u2019s statutory\nliability for the unpaid assessments,\nsubject to BANA\u2019s statute of limitations\ndefenses to assessments for the quarters\nended March 31, 2012 through March 31,\n2013, on which the Report recommends\nthat relevant issues should be resolved\nat trial. The Report also recommends\ndenying BANA\u2019s counterclaims challenging\nthe adoption of the relevant assessment\nregulations and granting BANA\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment on the FDIC\u2019s\nclaims for unjust enrichment and\ndisgorgement. The Report will be\nsubmitted to the district court judge\nfor consideration, and the parties have\nthe opportunity to file objections to\nthe recommendations in the Report.

The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if\nthe significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent\n\nmarketplace. During the three months\nended March 31, 2023, there were no\nchanges to valuation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are expected to\nhave, a material impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations.
