The decrease in\nnet income was due to higher noninterest\nexpense, lower revenue and higher\nprovision for credit losses. Total\nassets increased $93.7 billion from\nDecember 31, 2023 to $3.3 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher trading\naccount assets and securities borrowed\nor purchased under agreements to resell\nto support Global Markets client\nactivity, as well as higher debt\nsecurities. Total liabilities increased\n$91.7 billion from December 31, 2023 to\n$3.0 trillion primarily driven by higher\nsecurities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase and trading\naccount liabilities to support Global\nMarkets client activity, as well as\nhigher deposits due to time deposit\ngrowth and seasonal deposit inflows.\nShareholders\u2019 equity increased $1.9\nbillion from December 31, 2023 primarily\ndue to net income, partially offset by\nreturns of capital to shareholders\nthrough common stock repurchases and\ncommon and preferred stock dividends.\nNet Interest Income Net interest income\ndecreased $416 million to $14.0 billion\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. Net interest yield on a fully\ntaxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased\n21 basis points (bps) to 1.99 percent.\nThe decreases were primarily driven by\nhigher deposits and funding costs,\npartially offset by higher asset yields,\nhigher net interest income related to\nGlobal Markets activity and modest loan\ngrowth.

Non-GAAP financial measures\nexclude certain items or otherwise\ninclude components that differ from the\nmost directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures are provided as\nadditional useful information to assess\nour financial condition, results of\noperations (including period-to-period\noperating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures\nand may not be defined or calculated the\nsame way as non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and return\non average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity\nas key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 6.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 42.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends. These key performance indicators\n(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated\nin the same way as similar KPIs used by\nother companies.

For more\ninformation about GWIM , see Business\nSegment Operations in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\n\nNet income for GWIM increased $88\nmillion to $1.0 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 compared to\nthe same period in 2023 primarily due to\nhigher revenue, partially offset by\nhigher noninterest expense. The\noperating margin was 24 percent compared\nto 23 percent a year ago.\n\nNet interest income decreased $62\nmillion to $1.8 billion primarily driven\nby an increase in the deposit rate paid\nand lower average deposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily\nincludes investment and brokerage\nservices income, increased $338 million\nto $3.8 billion. The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher asset\nmanagement fees due to higher average\nequity market valuations and positive\nAUM flows, partially offset by the\nimpact of lower AUM pricing.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $197\nmillion to $4.3 billion primarily due to\nhigher revenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 22 percent, up from 20 percent, due\nto higher net income. For more\ninformation on capital allocated to the\nbusiness segments, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 8.\n\nAverage loans of $218.6 billion remained\nrelatively unchanged compared to the\nsame period in 2023. Average deposits\ndecreased $16.6 billion to $297.4\nbillion primarily driven by clients\nmoving deposits to higher yielding\ninvestment cash alternatives, including\nofferings on our investment and\nbrokerage platforms.\n\nMerrill Wealth Management revenue of\n$4.6 billion increased six percent\nprimarily driven by higher asset\nmanagement fees due to higher average\nequity market valuations and positive\nAUM flows, partially offset by the\nimpact of lower AUM pricing.\n\nBank of America Private Bank revenue of\n$944 million increased three percent\nprimarily driven by higher

affordable housing and renewable energy. Global Transaction Services\nrevenue decreased $399 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily\ndriven by the impact of interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of higher\naverage deposit balances and higher treasury service charges. Average loans and\nleases decreased two percent for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to\nlower client demand. Average deposits increased seven percent due to growth in\nboth domestic and international balances.

Amounts\nexcluding net DVA are a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure.

Net\nDVA losses were $85 million compared to\ngains of $14 million in 2023. Excluding\nnet DVA, net income increased $111\nmillion to $1.8 billion. These increases\nwere primarily driven by higher revenue,\npartially offset by higher noninterest\nexpense.\n\nRevenue increased $257 million to $5.9\nbillion primarily due to higher\ninvestment banking fees and sales and\ntrading revenue. Sales and trading\nrevenue increased $25 million, and\n\nexcluding net DVA, increased $124\nmillion. These increases were primarily\ndriven by higher revenue in Equities,\npartially offset by lower revenue in\nFICC.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $141\nmillion to $3.5 billion, primarily\ndriven by continued investments in the\nbusiness, including technology.\n\nAverage total assets increased $25.3\nbillion to $895.4 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 compared to\nthe same period in 2023 driven by higher\nlevels of inventory, increased secured\nfinancing activity and loan growth in\nFICC, partially offset by lower levels\nof inventory in Equities. Period-end\ntotal assets increased $85.2 billion\nfrom December 31, 2023 to $902.7 billion\ndriven by seasonally higher levels of\nclient activity across both Equities and\nFICC.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 15 percent, unchanged from the same\nperiod a year ago.

ALM activities\nencompass interest rate and foreign\ncurrency risk management activities for\nwhich substantially all of the results\nare allocated to our business segments.\nFor more information on our ALM\nactivities, see Note 17 \u2013 Business\nSegment Information to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nThe net loss in All Other increased $589\nmillion to $696 million primarily due to\nhigher noninterest expense.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $587\nmillion primarily due to a $700 million\naccrual for the increase in the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated share of the\nFDIC special assessment, partially\noffset by lower expenses related to a\nliquidating business activity.\n\nThe income tax benefit increased $66\nmillion to $1.9 billion due to higher\ntax preference benefits primarily\nrelated to tax credit investment\nactivity. Both periods included income\ntax benefit adjustments to eliminate the\nFTE treatment of certain tax credits\nrecorded in Global Banking and Global\nMarkets.\n                                                                                  \n  15Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Managing Risk                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nRisk is inherent in all our business\nactivities. The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile against our risk appetite\nand risk capacity. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. These risks are\nbeing managed within our Risk Framework\nand supporting risk management programs.\nFor more information on our Risk\nFramework, risk management activities\nand the key types of risk faced by the\nCorporation, see the Managing Risk\nsection in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning.

Based on 2023\nstress test results, our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) is 2.5 percent effective\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024. In April 2024, we submitted our\n2024 CCAR capital plan and related\nsupervisory stress tests. The Federal\nReserve has indicated that it will\ndisclose CCAR capital plan supervisory\nstress test results by June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Board has authorized the repurchase\nof up to $25 billion of common stock\nover time, which includes common stock\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder the Corporation\u2019s equity-based\ncompensation plans. Pursuant to Board\nauthorization, during the three months\nended March 31, 2024, we repurchased\n$2.5 billion of common stock. For more\ninformation, see Part II, Item 2.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity securities\nand Use of Proceeds on page 93 and\nCapital Management \u2013 CCAR and Capital\nPlanning in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets (RWA) under both\nthe Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The lower of the capital\nratios under Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements is\nused to assess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the PCA framework. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, the Common equity tier 1\n(CET1) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital ratios under the Standardized\napproach were the binding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. Effective January 1, 2024,\nthe Corporation's minimum CET1 capital\nratio requirements were 10.0 percent\nunder both the Standardized approach and\nthe Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. Effective January 1, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is\nhigher under Method 2, increased 50 bps,\nresulting in an increase in our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the\nStandardized approach to 10.0 percent\nfrom 9.5 percent. At March 31, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nMarch 31, 2024, our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries exceeded their\nrequirement to maintain a minimum 6.0\npercent SLR to be considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA framework.\n

five-year transition period\nrelated to the adoption of the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard on January 1, 2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum\nis the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 3.0 percent at March 31,\n2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,\n2023, and our capital conservation\nbuffer (under the Advanced approaches)\nor SCB (under the Standardized approach)\nof 2.5 percent, as applicable. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer was zero\nfor both periods. The SLR regulatory\nminimum includes a leverage buffer of\n2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt March 31, 2024, CET1 capital was\n$196.6 billion, an increase of $1.7\nbillion from December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital increased $1.7 billion primarily\ndriven by the same factors as CET1\ncapital. Total capital under the\nStandardized approach increased $1.0\nbillion primarily due to the same\nfactors driving the increase in Tier 1\ncapital and an increase in the adjusted\nallowance for credit losses included in\nTier 2 capital, partially\n\noffset by a decrease in subordinated\ndebt. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at March 31, 2024,\nincreased $6.4 billion during 2024 to\n$1,658 billion primarily driven by\nclient activity in

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus the\nCorporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent at March 31, 2024 and 2.5 percent at\nDecember 31, 2023. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5\npercent. Effective January 1, 2024, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is\nhigher under Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting in an increase in our long-term\ndebt RWA regulatory minimum requirement to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Developments                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nFor information on regulatory\ndevelopments, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Developments in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc.

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage market\nfluctuations from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding and\nliquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access to\nfunding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.

We can\nobtain cash for these securities, even\nin stressed conditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or outright sales.\nWe hold our GLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the liquidity\nrequirements of our global businesses,\nand we consider the impact of potential\nregulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 12 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 12          Average Global            Three Months                        \n  (Dollars in       Liquidity                        Ended           December 31  \n  billions)         Sources                  March 31 2024                  2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                        $               747    $              735  \n  Nonbank and                                                                     \n  other                                                162                   162  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               909    $              897  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\n\neligible assets was $326 billion and\n$312 billion at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 13 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n                    Average Global                                                \n  Table 13          Liquidity                 Three Months                        \n  (Dollars in       Sources                          Ended           December 31  \n  billions)         Composition              March 31 2024                  2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                              $               344    $              380  \n  deposit                                                                         \n  U.S. Treasury                                        228                   197  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-back\u2026                                                                  \n  securities,                                          313                   299  \n  and other                                                                       \n  investment-gr\u2026                                                                  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                            24                    21  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               909    $              897  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR) rules.

The LCR is\ncalculated as the amount of a financial\ninstitution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative\nto the estimated net cash outflows the\ninstitution could encounter over a\n30-day period of significant liquidity\nstress, expressed as a percentage. Our\naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net\nbasis, was $586 billion and $590 billion\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. For the same\nperiods, the average consolidated LCR\nwas 113 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR\nfluctuates due to normal business flows\nfrom customer activity.

We may, from time to\ntime, purchase outstanding debt\ninstruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions,\nliquidity and other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also make markets\nin our debt instruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2024 , we issued $6.8 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America22                                                               \n                                                                                  \nother unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured\nnote obligations for cash or other\nsecurities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price.

balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\nremained relatively unchanged during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024. Of\nthe nonperforming residential mortgage\nloans at March 31, 2024, $1.3 billion,\nor 64 percent, were current on\ncontractual payments. Loans accruing\npast due 30 days or more decreased $154\nmillion.\n\nOf the $216.8 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat March 31, 2024, $62.9 billion, or 29\npercent, of loans were originated as\ninterest-only. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.6 billion, or six percent,\nat March 31, 2024. Residential mortgage\nloans that have entered the amortization\nperiod generally experience a higher\nrate of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At March 31, 2024, $51 million,\nor one percent, of outstanding interest-\nonly residential mortgages that had\nentered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $832 million, or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2024, $188\n\nmillion, or five percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere nonperforming, of which $62 million\nwere contractually current. Loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three years to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n\nTable 19 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. In the\nNew York area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (MSA) made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within\nCalifornia represented 14 percent of\noutstandings at both March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                    Net           \n                                                                    Ch\u2026           \n  T\u2026                                                                Th\u2026           \n  19    Re\u2026       Out\u2026                 Non\u2026       De\u2026               Mo\u2026           \n  (\u2026    Mo\u2026       Mar\u2026       De\u2026       Mar\u2026        31               En\u2026           \n  in    St\u2026         31        31         31       20\u2026               Ma\u2026           \n  m\u2026    Co\u2026       2024       20\u2026       2024       20\u2026    2023        31           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026           $  80,\u2026    $  81\u2026    $   643    $  641            $    3    $   \u2014  \n  N\u2026              25,\u2026       25\u2026        317       320                 \u2014        2  \n  Y\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026              15,\u2026       15\u2026        142       131                -1       -2  \n  T\u2026              9,3\u2026       9,\u2026         89        88                 \u2014        \u2014  \n  N\u2026              8,6\u2026       8,\u2026         99        97                 \u2014        \u2014  \n  J\u2026                                                                              \n  O\u2026              76,\u2026       76\u2026        822       837                 1        1  \n  R\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026           $  216\u2026    $  21\u2026    $  2,1\u2026    $  2,\u2026            $    3    $   1  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026                                                                              \n  l\u2026              10,\u2026       10\u2026                                                  \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n  T\u2026                                                                              \n  r\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026           $  227\u2026    $  22\u2026                                                  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  25Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2024, the home equity\nportfolio made up six percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years, and after the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans\ngenerally convert to 15- or 20-year\namortizing loans.

The HELOC utilization\nrate was 35 percent at both March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nTable 20 presents certain home equity\nportfolio key credit statistics.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 20    Home                                                                \n  (Dollars    Equity \u2013                                                            \n  in          Key Credit                               March 31         December  \n  million\u2026    Statistic\u2026                                   2024          31 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Outstan\u2026                                         $     25,185    $      25,527  \n  Accruing                                                                        \n  past due                          83       95                                   \n  30 days                                                                         \n  or more                                                                         \n  Nonperf\u2026                                                  438              450  \n  loans(2)                                                                        \n  Percent                                                                         \n  of                                                                              \n  portfol\u2026                                                                        \n  Refresh\u2026                                                                        \n  CLTV                                                                            \n  greater                                                                         \n  than 90                   \u2014  %     \u2014  %                                         \n  but less                                                                        \n  than or                                                                         \n  equal to                                                                        \n  100                                                                             \n  Refresh\u2026                                                                        \n  CLTV                               \u2014        \u2014                                   \n  greater                                                                         \n  than 100                                                                        \n  Refresh\u2026                                                                        \n  FICO                                                        3                3  \n  below                                                                           \n  620                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings, accruing past due,\nnonperforming loans and percentages of\nthe portfolio exclude loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option.\n\n(2) Includes loans that are\ncontractually current that have not yet\ndemonstrated a sustained period of\npayment performance following a\nmodification.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe home equity portfolio decreased $12\nmillion to $438 million at March 31,\n2024, primarily driven by paydowns and\npayoffs and returns to performing status\noutpacing new additions. Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at March\n31, 2024, $255 million, or 58 percent,\nwere current on contractual payments. In\naddition, $101 million, or 23 percent,\nwere 180 days or more past due and had\nbeen written down to the estimated fair\nvalue of the collateral, less costs to\nsell. Accruing loans that were 30 days\nor more past due remained relatively\nunchanged during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\n\nOf the $25.2 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at March\n31, 2024, as shown in Table 20, 10\npercent require interest-only payments.\nThe outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhad reached the end of their draw period\nand entered the amortization period was\n$3.8 billion at March 31, 2024. The\nHELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At March 31, 2024, $33 million,\nor one percent, of outstanding HELOCs\nthat had entered the\n\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2024, $274 million, or seven\npercent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, 28 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 21 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio. In the New York area, the New\nYork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA\nmade up 11 percent of the outstanding\nhome equity portfolio at both March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.

In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 29, 31 and 34 summarize our\nconcentrations.

Commercial net\ncharge-offs\n\nincreased $316 million to $470 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2024 compared to the same period in 2023\nprimarily due to higher losses in the\ncommercial real estate office portfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2023; however, we are\nclosely monitoring emerging trends and\nborrower performance in the higher\ninterest rate environment. Recent demand\nfor office space has been stagnant, and\nfuture demand for office space continues\nto be uncertain as companies evaluate\nspace needs with employment models that\nutilize a mix of remote and conventional\noffice use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $85 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2024 to $4.7 billion. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 35.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure decreased $546 million during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024 to\n$695.8 billion primarily driven by lower\nderivative assets.

At March 31, 2024, 97\npercent of commercial nonperforming\nloans, leases and foreclosed properties\nwere secured, and 46 percent were\ncontractually current. Commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at 84\npercent of their unpaid principal\nbalance, as the carrying value of these\nloans has been reduced to the estimated\ncollateral value less costs to sell.\n                                                                                  \n  31Bank of America                                                               \n

To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection.

We recorded net losses of $25\nmillion for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 compared to net losses of $77\nmillion for the three months ended March\n31, 2023. The gains and losses on these\ninstruments were largely offset by gains\nand losses on the related exposures.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic\nand political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in\ngovernment policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor\nand manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing\nbusiness in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g.,\nrelated to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to\nclient clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal\ncourse of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather\nthan through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit\nand trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our\nnon-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 34 presents our 20\nlargest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2024. These exposures accounted\nfor 90 percent and 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $3.0\nbillion in 2024 primarily driven by decreases in Canada, Japan, Germany and\nAustralia, partially offset by an increase in the United Kingdom.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                      \u2026           \n

For more information on market\nrisks, see the Market section within\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 37 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 37 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 37 presents period-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023\nusing a 99 percent confidence level. The\namounts disclosed in Table 37 and Table\n38 align to the view of covered\npositions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and\ncommodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, regardless\nof trading or banking treatment for the\ntrade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe average of total covered positions\nand less liquid trading positions\nportfolio VaR for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 compared to the prior\nquarter remained stable.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading\ndays than the high and low for the components.

Periodically, we evaluate the\nscenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar\ninterest rates are floored at zero.\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2024, the overall decrease in asset\nsensitivity of our balance sheet to\nhigher and lower rate scenarios was\nprimarily due to higher expenses on\ninterest-bearing deposits as a result of\nhigher forward rates. We continue to be\nasset sensitive to a parallel upward\nmove in interest rates with the majority\nof that impact coming from the\n\nshort end of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates\nnegatively impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities classified as available\nfor sale and adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from the\nbanking book activities.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The behavior\nof our deposit portfolio in the baseline\nforecast and in alternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key assumption in our\nprojected estimates of net interest\nincome. The sensitivity analysis in\nTable 40 assumes no change in deposit\nportfolio size or mix from the baseline\nforecast in alternate rate environments.\nIn higher rate scenarios, the increase\nin net interest income would be impacted\nby any customer activity resulting in\nthe replacement of low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits with higher\nyielding deposits or market-based\nfunding,\n                                                                                  \n  39Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nas our benefit in those scenarios would\nbe reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate\nscenarios, any customer activity that\nresults in the replacement of higher\nyielding deposits or market-based\nfunding with low-cost or noninterest-\nbearing deposits would reduce our\nexposure in those scenarios.\n\nFor interest rate scenarios larger than\n100 bps shifts, it is expected that the\ninterest rate sensitivity will\nillustrate non-linear behaviors as there\nare numerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing\nwill have non-linear impacts to larger\nshort-end rate movements. In decreasing\ninterest rate scenarios, and\nparticularly where interest rates have\ndecreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced\nas customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit\npricing will likely increase at a faster\nrate, leading to incremental interest\nexpense and reducing asset sensitivity.\nWhile the impact related to the above\nassumptions used in the asset\nsensitivity analysis can provide\ndirectional analysis on how net interest\nincome will be impacted in changing\nenvironments, the ultimate impact is\ndependent upon the interrelationship of\nthe assumptions and factors, which vary\nin different macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 40.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial\n\ninstruments. These foreign exchange\nderivatives are sensitive to other\nmarket risk exposures such as cross-\ncurrency basis spreads and interest rate\nrisk. However, as these features are not\na significant component of these foreign\nexchange derivatives, the market risk\nrelated to this exposure is not\nsignificant. For more information on the\naccounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on\nIRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThere were no significant gains or\nlosses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the hedge portfolio,\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023. For more information on\nMSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Climate Risk                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate risk is the risk that climate\nchange or actions taken to mitigate\nclimate change expose the Corporation to\neconomic, legal/regulatory, operational\nor reputational harm. Climate-related\nrisks are divided into two major\ncategories, both of which span across\nthe seven key risk types discussed in\nthe Managing Risk section in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K: (1) Physical Risk: risks\nrelated to the physical impacts of\nclimate change, driven by extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes and\nfloods, as well as chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2)\nTransition Risk: risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor vendors. Transition risks of climate\nchange may amplify credit risks through\nthe financial impacts of changes in\npolicy, technology or the market on the\nCorporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk. Reputational\nrisk can arise if we do not meet our\nclimate-related goals and/or targets, or\nare perceived to be inadequately\nresponsive to climate change or\notherwise.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America40                                                               \n                                                                                  \nEnterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the\nCorporate Governance, ESG and\nSustainability Committee (CGESC) of the\nBoard, which regularly discuss climate-\nrelated topics. The ERC oversees climate\nrisk as set forth in our Risk Framework\nand Risk Appetite Statement. The CGESC\nis responsible for overseeing the\nCorporation\u2019s environmental and\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s climate-related policies\nand practices. Our Climate Risk Council\nconsists of leaders across risk, Front\nLine Unit and control functions, and\nmeets routinely to discuss our approach\nto managing climate-related risks.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by an officer who reports to\nthe Chief Risk Officer. The Corporation\nhas a Climate and Environmental Risk\nManagement function that is responsible\nfor overseeing climate risk management.\nThey are responsible for establishing\nthe Climate Risk Framework (described\nbelow) and governance structure, and\nproviding an independent assessment of\nenterprise-wide climate risks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, in 2023 we created our\ninternal Climate Risk Framework, which\naddresses how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes and\nalso includes examples of how climate\nrisk manifests across the seven risk\ntypes. The framework details the roles\nand responsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense (i.e., Front Line Units, Global\nRisk Management and Corporate Audit).\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see the Managing Risk section\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

In line with\nthis approach, we have set interim 2030\ntargets across our financing activities\nrelated to certain high-emitting sectors\n(2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets), operations and supply chain,\nall of which are further supported and\ncomplemented by our $1.5 trillion\nsustainable finance goal (which is\naligned with the 17 UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals) of which $1 trillion\nis dedicated to supporting the\ntransition toward a low-carbon economy,\nincluding capital mobilized across clean\nenergy sectors and tailored financial\nsolutions for emerging areas of the low-\ncarbon economy. In particular, we have\nannounced 2030 Financing Activity\nEmissions Targets for auto\nmanufacturing, aviation, cement, energy,\niron and steel, maritime shipping and\npower generation sectors.\n\nAchieving our climate--related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero goal and\n2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets, may require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, better emissions data\nreporting, new standards and public\npolicies, including those that improve\nthe cost of capital for the transition\nto a low-carbon economy, as well as\nstrong and active engagement with\ncustomers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.

The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\n\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such that the\nresults of any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC).\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three months ended March 31, 2024\nand 2023.

Of the $ 8.4billion after-tax net loss ($ 11.2billion\npretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at March 31, 2024, losses of $\n3.9billion after-tax ($ 5.2billion pretax) related to both open and terminated\ncash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12\nmonths. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily\ndecrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash\nflow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are\nhedged is approximately nine years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time\nperiod over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest\nincome is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time\nperiod being insignificant.\n                                                                                  \n  Ga\u2026

It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in\nthe form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that\nenhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of\nthe respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its\ncounterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and\nthe mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $\n105.1billion and $ 104.1billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $\n89.7billion and $ 93.4billion in the normal course of business under derivative\nagreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nFor more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. At March 31, 2024, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.1billion, including $ 1.6billion for Bank of America,\nNational Association. Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally\nterminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be\nrequired to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a\nguarantee. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liability recorded for\nthese derivative contracts was not significant. The following table presents the\namount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at March 31, 2024 if the rating\nagencies had downgraded their long-term\nsenior debt ratings for the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries by one\nincremental notch and by an additional\nsecond incremental notch.

At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 residential mortgage included $\n140million and $ 156million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 90million and $ 96million of\nloans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at March\n31, 2024.\n

Effective January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting standard on loan modifications.\nAccordingly, March 31, 2024 balances presented in payment status tables represent\nloans that were modified over the last 12 months, and March 31, 2023 balances\npresented in payment status tables represent loans that were modified during the\nfirst quarter of 2023. Consumer Real Estate The following modification programs\nare offered for consumer real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. These modifications represented outstanding residential mortgage and\nhome equity loans of 0.03percent and 0.04percent at March 31, 2024, compared to\n0.09percent and 0.15percent at March 31, 2023. Forbearance and Other Payment\nPlans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the\nborrower\u2019s payments for a defined period with those payments then due over a\ndefined period of time or at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging\nstatus of a loan is generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. At\nMarch 31, 2024, the amortized cost of residential mortgage loans that were\nmodified through these plans during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nwas $ 20million and $ 158million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that\nwere modified through these plans during the same periods was $ 0and $ 30million.\nThe weighted-average duration of the mortgage and home equity loan modifications\nwas insignificant, ranging from 3months to 9months for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023. If a borrower is unable to fulfill their obligations\nunder the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial offer or permanent\nmodification. Trial Offer and Permanent Modifications : Trial offer for\nmodification plans generally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower\nmodified loan terms that reduce their contractual payments temporarily over a\nthree-to- four-monthtrial period. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortized cost\nof residential\n\nmortgage loans entering trial offer for modifications during the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 53million and $ 21million. The amortized cost\nof home equity loans entering trial offer for modifications during both periods\nwas $ 9million. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during\nthe trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms\nbecome permanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a\ntrial period. In a permanent modification, the borrower\u2019s payment terms are\ntypically modified in more than one manner but generally include a term extension\nand an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent modification may also\ninclude principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest\namounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on\nmodifying the terms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the\ncontractual obligations. At March 31, 2024, the amortized cost of residential\nmortgage loans that were granted a permanent modification during the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 58million and $ 47million. The amortized cost\nof home equity loans that were granted permanent modification during the same\nperiods was $ 9million and $ 10million. The term extensions granted for\nresidential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can\nbe up to 30years, but are mostly in the range of 1to 20years. The weighted-average\nterm extension of permanent modifications for residential mortgage was 9.3years\nand 7.7years for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, while the\nweighted-average interest rate reduction was 1.28percent and 1.50percent. For the\nsame periods, the weighted-average term extension of permanent modifications for\nhome equity loans was 16.0years and 12.1years, while the weighted-average interest\nrate reduction was 2.84percent and 2.37percent. Principal forgiveness and payment\ndeferrals were insignificant during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023. For consumer real estate borrowers in financial difficulty that received a\nforbearance, trial or permanent modification, there were no commitments to lend\nadditional funds at March 31, 2024 and 2023. The Corporation tracks the\nperformance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, modified residential\nmortgage and home equity loans that defaulted were insignificant. The table below\nprovides aging information as of March 31, 2024 for consumer real estate loans\nthat were modified over the last 12 months and as of March 31, 2023 for consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified during the first quarter of 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Real                                                                   \n  Estate -                                                                        \n  Payment                                                                         \n  Status of                                                                       \n  Modifications                                                                   \n  to Borrowers                                                                    \n  in Financial                                                                    \n  Difficulty                                                                      \n  (Dollars in                Current       30\u201389 Days       90+ Days              \n  millions)           March 31, 2024         Past Due       Past Due       Total  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Residential      $             304    $          78    $        94    $    476  \n  mortgage                                                                        \n  Home equity                     51                6             14          71  \n  Total            $             355    $          84    $       108    $    547  \n                      March 31, 2023                                              \n  Residential      $             126    $          49    $        30    $    205  \n  mortgage                                                                        \n  Home equity                     23                7             10          40  \n  Total            $             149    $          56    $        40    $    245  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America66                                                               \n                                                                                  \nConsumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $ 90million and $ 83million at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of consumer real estate\nloans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $ 627million and $\n633million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 30million and $ 37million of consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are\nnot reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other\nConsumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest\nrate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months. As of March 31, 2024,\nsubstantially all payment plans provided to customers had a 60-monthterm. In\ncertain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding\nbalance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes\nmodifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal\nprograms) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide\nsolutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The\nMarch 31, 2024 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were\nmodified through these programs during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023 was $ 231million and $ 157million. These modifications represented\n0.11percent and 0.08percent of outstanding credit card and other consumer loans at\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023. The financial effect of modifications resulted in a\nweighted-average interest rate reduction of 19.80percent and 18.65percent, and\nprincipal forgiveness of $ 28million and $ 11million during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023. The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans\nto assess effectiveness of modification programs. As of March 31, 2024, defaults\nof modified credit card and other consumer loans over the last 12 months were\ninsignificant. As of March 31, 2023, defaults of modified credit card and other\nconsumer loans during the first quarter of 2023 were insignificant. At March 31,\n2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $ 658million, of which $\n537million were current, $ 62million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 59million\nwere greater than 90 days past due. At March 31, 2023, modified credit card and\nother consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the\nfirst quarter of 2023 totaled $ 157million, of which $ 109million were current, $\n24million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 24million were greater than 90 days past\ndue. Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while\nproviding borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties,\noften to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects\nthe borrower\u2019s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are\nprimarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve\nthe Bank forbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment\nin full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in\ninterest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial\nborrowers.

The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include\nkey macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate,\nreal estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-\nparty economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit\nlosses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The March 31, 2024 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a\ndownside scenario reflecting continued inflation and interest rates with minimal\nrate cuts, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement\nabove the baseline scenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above\nscenarios has improved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average\nunemployment rate will be just below fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2024 and\nwill remain near this level through the fourth quarter of 2025. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes sluggish growth in the first half of 2024 with U.S. real\ngross domestic product forecasted to grow at 0.6percent and at 1.7percent year-\nover-year in the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2025. The allowance for credit losses\ndecreased $ 180million from December 31, 2023 to $ 14.4billion at March 31, 2024,\nwhich included a $ 111million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio\nand a $ 69million reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio. The reserve\ndecrease was primarily driven by commercial due to an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net\ndecrease of $ 129million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease\nof $ 51million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decline in the\nallowance for credit losses was attributed to decreases in the commercial\nportfolio of $ 111million, the consumer real estate\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America68                                                               \n                                                                                  \nportfolio of $ 56million, and the credit card and other consumer portfolios of $\n13million. The provision for credit losses increased $ 388million to $ 1.3billion\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The\nprovision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was\nprimarily driven by credit card loans and the commercial real estate office\nportfolio. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the\nfair value option decreased $ 3.9billion during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 primarily driven by consumer loans, which decreased $ 5.7billion driven by\ncredit card, residential mortgage, and securities based lending. Commercial loans\nincreased $ 1.7billion driven by broad-based growth.

business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest\nEntities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K . The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities\nof consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in\nsituations where the Corporation has a loan or security interest and involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest\nin the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulting from its involvement with\nconsolidated VIEs and unconsolidated\n\nVIEs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that\nall of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential\nlosses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also\npotential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded\nliquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-\ndowns of assets. The Corporation invests in ABS, CLOs and other similar\ninvestments issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of\ninvolvement other than a loan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the\nCorporation also enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may\nutilize VIEs for activities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to\nhold collateral. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the\ninvestment balances. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013\nSecurities or Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit\nLosses and are not included in the following tables. The Corporation did not\nprovide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023 that it was not\npreviously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The\nCorporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and\ncollateral value guarantees, with certain\n                                                                                  \n  69Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nunconsolidated VIEs of $ 961million and $ 989million at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage\nbanking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties,\ngenerally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed\nby government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or\nthe Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-\ninsured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans.\nSecuritization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or\npurchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time,\nsecuritize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities.\nThe Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the\nCorporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including\nsenior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except\nas described in Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not\nprovide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard\nrepresentations and warranties. The table below summarizes select information\nrelated to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  First-lien                                                                      \n  Mortgage                                                                        \n  Securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n                   Residential                Commercial                          \n                    Mortgage -                Mortgage                            \n                        Agency                                                    \n                         Three                                                    \n                        Months                                                    \n                   Ended March                                                    \n                            31                                                    \n  (Dollars                                                                        \n  in                      2024        2023                       2024       2023  \n  millions)                                                                       \n  Proceeds                                                                        \n  from loan     $        1,209    $  1,347                   $  1,309    $   142  \n  sales(1)                                                                        \n  Gains                                                                           \n  (losses)                   \u2014          -5                         19          3  \n  on                                                                              \n  securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n  Repurchas\u2026                                                                      \n  from                       8           9                          \u2014          \u2014  \n  securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n  trusts(3)                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations\nsponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and\nprimarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 5million and $\n10million, net of hedges, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nare not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n90.5billion and $ 98.3billion at March 31, 2024 and 2023. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 62million and $ 69million during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Servicing advances on serviced loans,\nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n1.2billion and $ 1.3billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . Home Equity Loans The\nCorporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the\nCorporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a\nrapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure\nin the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result\nof the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity\nlines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the\ntiming of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation deconsolidated agency\nresidential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $ 793million and $\n328million.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Credit Card and\nAutomobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and\npurchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are\nsold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are\nongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either\nloan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on\nthe securitization structure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various\nsubordinated interests, including an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit\ncard receivables and owning certain retained interests. At March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $\n18.0billion and $ 16.6billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the\ncarrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party\ninvestors from the trusts totaled $ 7.6billion and $ 7.8billion, which are\nincluded in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation\nresecuritized $ 2.8billion and $ 1.6billion of securities during the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs\nwere measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making\nand similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or\nloss on sale was recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n88million and $ 586million, of which substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets for both periods. Substantially all of the\ntrading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-\nlinked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset\nacquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to\nobtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or\nfinancial instrument. The Corporation\u2019s involvement in the VIE is limited to its\nloss exposure. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 913million and $ 952million at March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, including the notional amount of derivatives to which\nthe Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Municipal Bond\nTrusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated,\nlong-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing\nfloating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term\nbasis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to\nunconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation\n                                                                                  \n  71Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nwas transferor, totaled $ 1.8billion and $ 1.7billion at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts\nat March 31, 2024 was 12.2years. There were no significant write-downs or\ndowngrades of assets or issuers during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities,\ntypically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple\ntranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party\nportfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs,\nholds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the\nCDOs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated\nCDOs totaled $ 86million and $ 80million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nInvestment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which\nmay be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that\nhold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are\ndesigned to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $ 99million and $ 472million. The\nCorporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $\n20.7billion and $ 18.4billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 2.2billion and $ 2.6billion at March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less\nnon-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.1billion at both March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars,\npower generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The\nnet investment represents the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The table\nbelow summarizes the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation that\nrelated to other asset-backed VIEs at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n

or practice to sell or repledge. At March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of this collateral was $ 978.3billion and $\n911.3billion, of which $ 941.8billion and $ 870.9billion were sold or repledged.\nThe primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 5.3billion and $ 5.6billion, predominantly related to cash\nsegregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet reserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk\n\nlimitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Credit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount\nof unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e.,\nsyndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed\namounts were $ 9.9billion and $ 10.3billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s credit extension commitments at both\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, excluding commitments accounted for under\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.2billion, which predominantly related to the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments\nis classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have\nspecified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change\nclauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay.\n                                                                                  \n  75Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe table below includes the notional amount of commitments of $ 3.1billion and $\n2.6billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that are accounted for under\nthe fair value option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value\nfor these commitments of $ 78million and $ 67million at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nFor more information regarding the Corporation\u2019s loan commitments accounted for\nunder the fair value option, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value Option.\n

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 24.0billion and $\n9.3billion at March 31, 2024, and $ 23.6billion and $ 9.7billion at December 31,\n2023. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 795million and $ 744million\nat March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 432million and $ 822million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 1.2billion and $ 420million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\nhad commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities\nborrowing agreements of $ 142.9billion and $ 117.0billion, and commitments to\nenter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $\n121.9billion and $ 63.0billion. A significant portion of these commitments will\nexpire within the next 12months. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 4.0billion on a\nrolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This\ncommitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior\nnotice. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had unfunded\nequity investment commitments of $ 473million and $ 477million. As a Federal\nReserve member bank, the Corporation is required to subscribe to a certain amount\nof shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays cumulative\ndividends at a prescribed rate. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had paid $ 5.4billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the\nremaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district bank board, which\nthe Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance\nBook Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nnotional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.5billion and $ 3.8billion. At\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related\nto these guarantees totaled $ 527million and $ 577million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2033 and 2037. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable\nfor any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among\nother things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after\na purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The\nability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 324billion, is an estimate\nof the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of March 31, 2024. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America76                                                               \n                                                                                  \narea primarily relates to circumstances\nwhere a cardholder has purchased goods\nor services for future delivery. The\nCorporation mitigates this risk by\nrequiring cash deposits, guarantees,\nletters of credit or other types of\ncollateral from certain merchants. The\nCorporation\u2019s reserves for contingent\nlosses, and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were\nnot significant. Representations and\nWarranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees,\nsee Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 305million and $\n604million at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and\nthe related provision is included in\nother income in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The representations\nand warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of incurred\nlosses, is based on its experience in\nprevious negotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 104.2billion and $ 132.5billion at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and\n\nunconditional guarantee of trust\nsecurities and capital securities issued\nby certain statutory trust companies\nthat are 100percent owned finance\nsubsidiaries of the Corporation. Other\nContingencies During the first quarter\nof 2024, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) increased its\nestimate of the loss to the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (DIF) arising from the\nclosures of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank. The estimated loss to\nthe DIF will be recovered through the\ncollection of a special assessment from\ncertain insured depository institutions.\nAccordingly, the Corporation recorded a\npretax charge of $ 700million in other\ngeneral operating expenses to increase\nits accrual to $ 2.8billion for the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated share of the\nFDIC special assessment. The\nCorporation\u2019s share of the special\nassessment will remain subject to change\nas new information or updates to the\nestimated loss to the DIF become\navailable.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, whether a loss\nin excess of any accrued liability is\nreasonably possible in future periods.\nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to\nbe both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued\nliability and record a corresponding\namount of litigation-related expense.\nThe Corporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n97million and $ 89million was recognized\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023. For any matter disclosed\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure for which a\nloss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n0.8billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of March 31, 2024.\nThe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are based upon\ncurrently available information and\nsubject to significant judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The matters\nunderlying the accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nestimated range of possible loss does\nnot represent the Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure. Information is provided\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure regarding the\nnature of the litigation and, where\nspecified, associated claimed damages.\nBased on current knowledge, and taking\ninto account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of those matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthose matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments\nunder applicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable in the current marketplace. During the three months\nended March 31, 2024, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques\nthat had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated financial position or results of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFor more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation\nmeasures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nCorporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value\noption. For more information, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value Option .
