Our Board has implemented a number of\nmeasures to enrich Board composition, enhance independent\noversight and increase their effectiveness. These\nmeasures align our corporate governance structure with\nachieving our strategic objectives, and enable our Board\nto effectively communicate and oversee our culture of\ncompliance and rigorous risk management.

Our Investor Relations\nteam regularly meets with investors, prospective\ninvestors, and investment analysts. These meetings often\ninclude participation by our Chairman and CEO, Chief\nFinancial Officer, or line of business leaders, and they\ngenerally are focused on company performance, strategy,\nand Responsible Growth. In addition to the investor\nrelations meetings, our Board and management also\nroutinely engage with our shareholders and other\nstakeholders. Throughout 2020 and into 2021, we provided\ndirect updates about our Board and our company to our 250\nlargest shareholders representing approximately 61% of\nour shares outstanding and to key stakeholders. During\nthat same time period, our Board and management met with\nshareholders representing approximately 24% or 2.1\nbillion of our shares outstanding and with other\nstakeholders to solicit their input on important\ngovernance, executive compensation, human capital\nmanagement, regulatory, sustainability, pandemic-related\ndevelopments, and other matters. This continued exchange\nhas informed our Board\u0092s meeting agendas, and contributes\nto governance and disclosure enhancements that help us\naddress the issues our shareholders and key stakeholders\ntell us matter most to them. Importantly, this engagement\nprocess complements Responsible Growth and assists us in\nachieving our strategic objectives, creating long-term\nvalue, maintaining our culture of compliance, and\ncontributing to our ESG activities. To provide more\nclarity regarding the Board\u0092s oversight of sustainability\nand ESG matters, the Board updated the charter of its\nCorporate Governance Committee in 2016 to reflect the\nCommittee\u0092s more direct oversight of our company\u0092s ESG\nmatters and our management-level Global ESG Committee. In\nearly 2020, to reflect this additional oversight and to\nprovide clarity to investors and stakeholders, the Board\nchanged the name of the Committee to the \u0093Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee\u0094 and also\nchanged the name of its Compensation and Benefits\nCommittee to \u0093Compensation and Human Capital Committee\u0094\nto highlight the Board\u0092s ongoing oversight of\nsustainability, ESG, and human capital matters. Since\nthat time, the Board has further strengthened its ESG\noversight by having our management-level Global ESG\nCommittee escalate environmental and social risks to the\nManagement Risk Committee, which in turn reports to the\nBoard\u0092s Enterprise Risk Committee.

Our Global ESG Committee\nis comprised of senior executives across every line of\nbusiness and support function who help guide the\ncompany\u0092s efforts and enable ESG progress. The committee\nidentifies and discusses ESG issues material to our\nbusiness\u0097including our human capital management\npractices, products and service offerings, client\nselection, and investments in creating a sustainable\nglobal economy\u0097and helps set and monitor our progress\nagainst these ESG goals. The committee regularly reports\nto the Board\u0092s Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee on the company\u0092s ESG activities\nand emerging ESG risks and opportunities, and provides\nESG risk updates to the Board\u0092s Enterprise Risk Committee\nthrough the Management Risk Committee. In addition, the\nBoard\u0092s Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees\nour human capital management practices and receives\nregular reports from our Chief Human Resources Officer,\nwho is a member of the Global ESG Committee. As part of\nthese efforts, management established a Sustainable\nMarkets Committee, co-chaired by Vice Chairman Anne\nFinucane and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Tom Montag, to\naccelerate our progress, identify new opportunities, and\nbuild upon our work in sustainable finance including\nhelping accelerate the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Our CEO, together with the chair of our Global\nESG Committee, Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, and her team\nengage with consumer advocates, community advisors, and\nother stakeholders for their advice and guidance in\nshaping our ESG policies and practices. This includes our\nNational Community Advisory Council (NCAC), comprised of\nsenior leaders from social justice, consumer advocacy,\ncommunity development, environmental, research, and\nadvocacy organizations, and bank executives. Since its\nfounding in 2005, the NCAC has met at least twice\nannually to provide external perspectives on our business\npolicies, practices and products.

Being a great place to work Another way we\ndrive Responsible Growth is by being a great place to\nwork. We deliver on our commitment to be a great place to\nwork by being a diverse and inclusive workplace,\nattracting and developing exceptional talent, supporting\nemployees\u0092 physical, emotional, and financial wellness,\nand recognizing and rewarding performance. Through this\nlens, we provide compensation, benefits, and resources to\nemployees that enhance their experience and further their\ncareers with us. This is not only good for our business\nbut it is the right thing to do. Our shareholders have\ninformed us of the importance they place on transparency\nand understanding our employee practices. In October\n2020, we published our latest Human Capital Management\nReport to provide information and details on all we do to\nsupport our employees and their families, including the\nsteps we have taken during the global health crisis over\nthe past year, as well as the additional steps we are\ntaking to continue to build on this progress. As\ndescribed in the report, our company focuses significant\nresources on hiring, developing, and retaining diverse\ntalent. We value and promote diversity and inclusion in\nevery aspect of our business and at every level of our\norganization. Our commitment to creating a diverse and\ninclusive environment starts at the top with our Board\nand executive leadership, who play key roles in the\noversight of our culture, and our growth as a diverse\nworkplace and an inclusive work environment. For over 20\nyears, our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council, chaired\nby our CEO and comprising of senior executives from every\narea of the company, has promoted diversity goal setting,\nwhich is embedded in our performance management system\nand occurs at all levels of the enterprise. Our company\nseeks to build a diverse pipeline of candidates for\npositions at all levels of the company, including\nleadership positions. We routinely disclose our company\u0092s\nworkforce diversity metrics in order to publicly hold\nourselves accountable and to confirm whether we are\ndelivering on our commitment to increase diverse\nrepresentation across the company wherever possible. Our\ncommitment to diversity has resulted in improvements in\nkey workforce diversity metrics, and our practices and\npolicies have also resulted in strong representation\nwhere our broad employee population mirrors the clients\nand communities we serve. To help drive a culture of\ninclusion, our company has developed and provided all\nemployees access to a range of programs and resources\nfocused on building understanding and driving progress in\nthe workplace. In 2020, more than 165,000 employees\nparticipated in over 320 courageous conversations focused\non expanding our perspectives to drive a culture of\ninclusion. Our CEO and COO also hosted multiple diverse\nspeakers in virtual town halls to engage in an open\ndialogue on diversity and inclusion. In 2020, we had\nnearly 88,000 total diversity & inclusion program\ncompletions, reaching more than 63,300 unique employees.\nOur focus on being a great place to work is highlighted\nin our 2020 Human Capital Management Report (available at\nhttps://about.bankofamerica.com/annualmeeting) and\ndescribed in further detail in \u0093Responsible Growth\u0094\nstarting on page 33. Our focus on climate change and the\nenvironment Building on Bank of America\u0092s longstanding\nsupport for the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global\nwarming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, in February\n2021, we outlined initial steps to achieve our goal of\nnet zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our financing\nactivities, operations, and supply chain before 2050. We\ncontinue to actively engage with our clients to support\ntheir own transitions to net zero and plan to establish\ninterim emissions reduction targets for high-emitting\nportfolios, including energy and power. In addition, we\nreleased our broader 2030 operational and supply chain\ngoals as part of a holistic commitment to environmental\nsustainability. As part of our transition to net zero, in\nJuly 2020, our company joined the Partnership for Carbon\nAccounting Financials (PCAF) as a member of the Global\nCore Team. In collaboration with 15 other financial\ninstitutions, we contributed to the development of the\nGlobal GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the\nFinancial Industry, providing a consistent methodology to\nassess and disclose emissions associated with financing\nactivities. We are committed to disclosing our financed\nemissions no later than 2023. This collaboration builds\non our ongoing and recent efforts with partners to\naddress the financing, technology, policy, and other\nchallenges inherent in the transition to a net zero\nglobal economy. We achieved carbon neutrality in our\noperations in 2019, a year ahead of schedule, and engaged\nwith our vendors to successfully increase the number of\nvendors that measure and publicly report GHG emissions\nthrough the CDP Supply Chain survey. We have established\nthe next set of targets for our operations and supply\nchain to be achieved by 2030, including: maintaining\ncarbon neutrality for operations (Scope 1 and 2);\npurchasing 100% zero carbon electricity; reducing\nlocation-based GHG emissions by 75% (Scope 1 and 2); and\nreducing energy use by 55%. We are also deploying capital\nto low-carbon, sustainable business activities.\nSignificantly increasing investment in the low-carbon\ntechnologies and activities needed to decarbonize all\nsectors of the economy will be critical to meeting our\ngoals. Since 2007, we have mobilized more than $200\nbillion in capital and have committed to mobilize an\naggregate of at least $445 billion by 2030 under our\nEnvironmental Business Initiative. Under this initiative,\nwe partner closely with our clients to finance the\nadoption of low-carbon solutions, including resource-\nefficient building construction, solar and wind power\ngeneration, electric vehicles and charging\ninfrastructure, and resource-efficient agriculture. We\nare also dedicating significant financial, intellectual,\nphilanthropic, and catalytic capital to support the\nadvancement of developing technologies, such as\nsustainable agriculture and biofuels, water\ninfrastructure, clean hydrogen, waste-to-energy, and\ncarbon capture sequestration technologies.

We continue to leverage our business    \n  continuity plans and capabilities to service our       \n  clients and meet our clients\u0092 financial needs by        \n  offering assistance to clients affected                \n  by the coronavirus and providing access to credit and  \n  the important financial services on which our clients  \n  rely. We continue to support the communities where we  \n  live and work by engaging in various initiatives to    \n  help those affected by this health                     \n  and humanitarian crisis.                               \n                                                         \nOur Board has taken an active role in overseeing\nmanagement\u0092s implementation of our response. In 2020, our\nBoard held 28 meetings, 33% more than 2019. In addition\nto formal meetings, our Board participated in five\ninformation sessions and received regular and timely\nhealth-related updates through meeting presentations and\nstand-alone memoranda. Supporting our teammates Our\ncommitment to support our teammates has been in sharp\nfocus in 2020 and into 2021. We continue to take steps to\nprovide enhanced employee benefits, programs, and\nresources for all of our teammates, both in direct\nresponse to the current health crisis and for ongoing,\nlong-term needs. To support the health and well-being of\nour employees we did not make layoffs in 2020 due to the\ncurrent health crisis, we transitioned 85% of our\nemployees to work from home, and reskilled and realigned\nmore than 24,000 employees to serve and support our\nclients in new capacities. To further support our\nemployees, we provided employees\u0092 families with nearly 3\nmillion days of back-up care for children and adults as\nwell as providing student enrichment resources. During\n2020, we expanded physical wellness benefits by providing\nno-cost telehealth resources with 24/7 virtual access to\ngeneral medicine doctors and mental health specialists to\nemployees, (1)and for employees remaining in the office,\ntemperature checks, daily health screenings, and onsite\nnurses at many of our sites. We supported our teammates\u0092\nfinancial wellness by making grants to teammates related\nto the current health crisis from our Employee Relief\nFund, updating our retirement plans for CARES Act\nprovisions, and offering other support including salary\ncontinuation for teammates unable to work due to the\nhealth crisis. In addition, we enhanced our emotional\nwellness benefits, made behavioral health Teladoc\n\u00aeconsultations available to enrolled members, and\nreleased numerous trainings and videos on the topic.\nSupporting our clients All Bank of America teammates who\nwork with clients are trained to identify and assist\npandemic impacted clients and provide the right support\nto address their unique needs. Bank of America\nunderstands the critical role financial services plays in\nthe daily lives of individuals and small businesses.

We have\nbeen actively involved in the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration\u0092s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)\u0097we\nwere the first major bank to begin accepting PPP\napplications in early April of 2020. We have helped\napproximately 343,000 small business clients\u0097in every\nindustry, in every market\u0097receive PPP loans and will\ncontinue to support our small business clients who have\nalready received PPP funding through the loan forgiveness\nprocess. We continue to be a leading provider of PPP\nloans for clients in 2021. Supporting our communities\nWe\u0092ve continued to support communities impacted by the\ncoronavirus by partnering with global, national, and\nlocal partners delivering health and humanitarian\nresources. Specifically, we committed $100 million in\nphilanthropy to support and address pressing needs\nrelated to the coronavirus, including healthcare, food,\neducation, and needs in vulnerable communities, in\naddition to the $250 million in philanthropic investments\nwe provide each year. In order to support the many small\nbusinesses impacted by the coronavirus, we provided more\nthan $250 million in capital to Community Development\nFinancial Institutions (CDFIs) and MDIs to facilitate\nlending through the PPP, and $10 million in philanthropic\ngrants to help fund the operations of CDFIs and MDIs.\nBank of America is the largest private investor in CDFIs\nin the U.S., with a $1.8 billion CDFI portfolio spanning\n256 partner CDFIs across all 50 states. In 2020, we\nissued a $1 billion corporate social bond to support\nthose on the front lines of the health crisis.

Our Board also assesses\ndirectors\u0092 age and tenure, and Board continuity; it\nstrives to achieve a balance between the perspectives of\nnew directors and those of longer-serving directors with\nindustry and institutional insights. Our Board views\ndiversity as a priority and seeks representation across a\nrange of attributes. It regularly assesses our Board\u0092s\ndiversity when identifying and evaluating director\ncandidates. See the next page. In addition, our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee follows\napplicable regulations in confirming that our Board\nincludes members who are independent, possess financial\nliteracy and expertise, and an understanding of risk\nmanagement principles, policies, and practices, and have\nexperience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk\nexposures. Our current Board, including the 16 director\nnominees, reflects the Board\u0092s commitment to identify,\nevaluate, and nominate candidates who possess personal\nqualities, qualifications, skills, and diversity of\nbackgrounds, and provide a mix of tenures that, when\ntaken together, best serve our company and our\nshareholders. See \u0093Our director nominees\u0094 on page 5.\nSuccession planning and the director recruitment process\nOur Board regularly reviews and renews its composition.\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee is responsible for identifying and recommending\ndirector candidates to our Board for nomination using a\ndirector selection process that has been reviewed and\nacknowledged by our primary bank regulators. The Board,\nin coordination with the Board committees, also regularly\nconsiders Board leadership succession planning and\ncommittee membership.\n                             \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    3  \n                             \nProposal 1: Electing directors Assess. The Committee\nregularly reviews the mix of individual directors on our\nBoard to assess the overall Board composition. Among\nother factors, the Committee considers our company\u0092s\nstrategy and needs; our directors\u0092 experiences,\ndiversity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and\nqualifications our Board identifies in its self-\nevaluations to develop criteria for potential candidates\nand assess whether these attributes and qualifications\nare additive to our overall Board composition. To\nmaintain a vibrant mixture of viewpoints and benefit from\nthe fresh perspectives brought by new directors and the\ninstitutional knowledge and industry insights of\ndirectors having longer experience on our Board, the\nCommittee reviews measures that enhance the Board\u0092s\nsuccession planning process, including the appropriate\nretirement age and related tenure limitations, and\nability to commit the time necessary to our company. For\nadditional information on the average tenure of directors\nserving on our Board and each director\u0092s tenure, see \u0093Our\ndirector nominees\u0094 on page 5. Identify. To drive\neffective Board renewal and director and Board leadership\nsuccession planning, the Committee has a regularly\nrecurring agenda item to develop and review a diverse\ngroup of potential director candidates. Based on the\nfactors and criteria developed in the assessment phase,\nthe Committee engages third-party search firms to\nidentify potential candidates for review. It considers\nand provides feedback on the then-current pool of\ndirector talent identified by search firms; the search\nfirms periodically update the list of potential director\ncandidates based on Committee and Board input. In 2020,\nthe Committee continued to develop the pool of potential\ndirector candidates using multiple external search firms.\nIn its work with the external search firms, the Committee\nemphasizes the importance of diversity by requesting the\ninclusion of diverse candidates in its consideration of\npotential directors. Potential director candidates\npossess professional experiences and racial, ethnic,\ngender, nationality, and other relevant attributes\naligned with Committee-specified criteria and with the\nqualities identified by our Board in recent self-\nevaluations. See \u0093Board evaluation\u0094 on page 21 for\nadditional information on our Board\u0092s self-evaluation\nprocess. The Committee also considers candidates proposed\nby management and by our shareholders.\n                                                         \n  Evaluate.

The\nFederal Reserve Board\u0092s Enhanced Prudential Standards\nrequire the chair of our Enterprise Risk Committee to be\nindependent. In addition, our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines require a substantial majority of our\ndirectors to be independent. Our Board has adopted\nDirector Independence Categorical Standards (Categorical\nStandards), published on our website at\nhttp://investor.bankofamerica.com, to assist it in\ndetermining each director\u0092s independence. Our Board\nconsiders directors or director nominees \u0093independent\u0094 if\nthey meet the criteria for independence in both the NYSE\nlisting standards and our Categorical Standards. In early\n2020, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, evaluated\nthe relevant relationships between each director or\ndirector nominee (and his or her immediate family members\nand affiliates) and Bank of America Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries and affirmatively determined that all of our\ndirectors and director nominees are independent, except\nfor Mr. Moynihan due to his employment by our company.\nSpecifically, the following directors and director\nnominees are independent under the NYSE listing standards\nand our Categorical Standards: Ms. Allen, Ms. Bies, Mr.\nBovender, Mr. Bramble, Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Ms.\nHudson, Ms. Lozano, Mr. May, Mr. Nowell, Ms. Ramos, Dr.\nRose, Mr. White, Mr. Woods, Mr. Yost, and Dr. Zuber. In\nmaking its independence determinations, our Board\nconsidered the following ordinary course, non-\npreferentialrelationships that existed during the\npreceding three years and those applicable transactions\nreported under \u0093Related person and certain other\ntransactions\u0094 on page 42, and determined that none of the\nrelationships for the directors and director nominees set\nforth above constituted a material relationship between\nthe director or director nominee and our company:\n                                                         \n      Our company or its subsidiaries provided ordinary  \n      course financial products and services to all of   \n      our directors and                                  \n      director nominees, some of their immediate family  \n      members, and entities affiliated with some of      \n      them or their immediate family members (Mr.\u00a0de     \n      Weck, Mr.\u00a0Donald, and Dr.\u00a0Rose). In each case,     \n      the fees we received for these products and        \n      services were below the thresholds of the NYSE     \n      listing standards and our Categorical Standards,   \n      and, where applicable, were less than 2% of the    \n      consolidated gross annual revenues of our company  \n      and of the other entity.                           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Our company or its subsidiaries purchased          \n      products or services in the ordinary course from   \n      entities where some of our                         \n      directors and director nominees are executive      \n      officers or employees or their immediate family    \n      members serve or served in the past three years    \n      as executive officers (Mr.\u00a0Donald, Dr.\u00a0Rose, and   \n      Mr.\u00a0Woods). In each case, the fees paid to         \n      each of these entities were below the thresholds   \n      of the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical  \n      Standards.                                         \n                                                         \n                         \n  18    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Independent board leadership Our\nBoard is committed to objective, independent leadership\nfor our Board and each of its committees. Our Board views\nthe active, objective, independent oversight of\nmanagement as central to effective Board governance, to\nserving the best interests of our company and our\nshareholders, and to executing our strategic objectives\nand creating long-term value. This commitment is\nreflected in our company\u0092s governing documents, including\nour Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the\ngoverning documents of each of the Board\u0092s committees.\nOur Board leadership structure Our Board\u0092s optimal\nleadership structure may change over time to reflect our\ncompany\u0092s evolving needs, strategy, and operating\nenvironment; changes in our Board\u0092s composition and\nleadership needs; and other factors, including the\nperspectives of shareholders and other stakeholders. In\naccordance with a 2014 amendment to our Bylaws, which our\nshareholders ratified at a special meeting in 2015, our\nBoard has the flexibility to determine the Board\nleadership structure best suited to the needs and\ncircumstances of our company and our Board. Our\nshareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing this\nflexibility by voting against shareholder proposals\nseeking Bylaw amendments requiring an independent\nChairman at each of our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of\nshareholders. At least annually, our Board, in\ncoordination with our Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, deliberates on and discusses\nthe appropriate Board leadership structure, including the\nconsiderations described above. Under our Board\u0092s current\nleadership structure, we have a Chairman and a Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Lead Independent Director is\nempowered with, and exercises, robust, well-defined\nduties. Our Board is composed of experienced and\ncommitted independent directors (with all non-\nmanagementnominees being independent). Our Board\ncommittees have objective, experienced chairs and\nmembers. All our directors are required to stand for\nelection annually. Our Board, under leadership of the\nLead Independent Director, is committed to engaging with\nshareholders and other stakeholders. Our Board believes\nthat these factors, taken together, provide for\nobjective, independent Board leadership, effective\nengagement with and oversight of management, and a voice\nthat is independent from management and accountable to\nshareholders and other stakeholders. Our Lead Independent\nDirector, together with the other independent directors,\nexemplifies objective independent Board leadership, and\neffectively engages and oversees management. The Lead\nIndependent Director is joined by experienced,\nindependent Board members and a Chairman who, as CEO,\nserves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term\nstrategy and our Responsible Growth. The independent\ndirectors provide objective oversight of management,\nreview the CEO\u0092s performance and approve CEO\ncompensation, help to establish the long-term strategy\nand regularly assess its effectiveness, and serve the\nbest interests of our company and our shareholders by\noverseeing management\u0092s work to create long-term value.\nOur Board, through its annual assessment, with input from\nshareholders, believes that the existing structure\ncontinues to be the optimal leadership framework at this\ntime. As a highly regulated global financial services\ncompany, we and our shareholders benefit from an\nexecutive Chairman with deep experience and leadership in\nand knowledge of the financial services industry, our\ncompany, its businesses, and our focus on Responsible\nGrowth. We and our shareholders also benefit from a Lead\nIndependent Director who is empowered and exercises\nrobust, well-defined duties (see next page for a list of\nthe duties); who is highly engaged and holds regular\nmeetings with our primary regulators, our independent\ndirectors, and our CEO and other management members, and\nplays a leading role in our shareholder engagement\nprocess (see page 30).\n                                                         \n  Highly engaged Lead Independent\u00a0Director               \n  The formalized list                                    \n  of duties of the Lead Independent Director does not    \n  fully capture the active role of our Board\u0092s            \n  independent leader.

In addition,\nour Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee has a process for implementing an orderly\nindependent director leadership transition for our Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nprovide that an individual who would be age 75 at the\ntime of election shall not be nominated for initial\nelection to the Board, provided that the Board may\napprove the nomination for reelection of a director who\nwould be age 75 at the time of election, if, in light of\nall the circumstances, the Board determines that it is in\nthe best interests of the Corporation and its\nshareholders.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    19  \n                              \nCorporate Governance\n                                                         \n  Our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Bovender has        \n  reached the retirement age of 75,                      \n  and will retire from the Board at the upcoming annual  \n  meeting. In anticipation of his retirement and to      \n  assure an orderly transition for the Lead Independent  \n  Director role, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and      \n  Sustainability Committee devoted                       \n  considerable time and attention to succession          \n  planning. Starting in 2019 and at each Committee       \n  meeting through September 2020, the Committee          \n  reviewed, planned for, and executed on an appropriate  \n  and well-considered Lead Independent Director          \n  succession plan. The Committee regularly apprised the  \n  Board of its deliberations and planning.               \n  During the planning process and as a part of its       \n  deliberations, the Committee considered feedback       \n  received through the Board\u0092s formal self-evaluations    \n  and a number                                           \n  of factors the Committee deemed relevant to            \n  recommending a successor, including key skills and     \n  competencies of the Lead Independent Director          \n  position, professional and personal attributes it      \n  determined to be necessary to successfully serve in    \n  the                                                    \n  role, and the time necessary to discharge the duties   \n  of a Lead Independent Director. Our Lead Independent   \n  Director, Mr. Bovender, and the chair of the           \n  Committee, Mr. May, met with each independent          \n  director individually to discuss the key skills and    \n  competencies of the Lead Independent Director          \n  position, and potential successors to Mr. Bovender.    \n  These conversations were reviewed with the Committee   \n  and the Board.                                         \n  Following the Committee\u0092s review of potential           \n  candidates and due deliberation, the Committee         \n  recommended that the Board appoint Mr. Nowell to       \n  succeed Mr. Bovender as                                \n  Lead Independent Director upon Mr. Bovender\u0092s           \n  retirement; the Board approved Mr. Nowell\u0092s             \n  appointment at its meeting in September 2020.          \n  A thoughtful transition plan is in place for Mr.       \n  Nowell, and he has been working closely with Mr.       \n  Bovender to assist in the transition. For example,     \n  since                                                  \n  Mr.\u00a0Nowell\u0092s appointment as the Lead Independent        \n  Director successor, he regularly meets with our CEO    \n  and key regulators, and is joining Mr.\u00a0Bovender in     \n  his quarterly calls with independent directors as      \n  well as the company\u0092s                                   \n  shareholder engagement meetings. He is expected to     \n  meet with additional key shareholders prior to the     \n  2021 annual meeting. Mr. Nowell\u0092s term as Lead          \n  Independent Director will commence upon his            \n  re-election to the Board by shareholders at the        \n  2021 annual meeting.

The\nevaluation is a multi-faceted process that includes\nquarterly one-on-one discussions with our Lead\nIndependent Director, individual director input on Board\nand committee meeting topical agenda subjects, executive\nsessions without management present, periodic input to\nour CEO and senior management on topical agendas and\nenhancements to Board and committee effectiveness, and an\nannual formal self-evaluation developed and administered\nunder the direction of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee. Formal self-evaluation\nInformation from research commissioned by the Board on\nthe characteristics of highly effective and efficient\nboards identified five key areas where the research\nsuggested high functioning boards and committees\nexcelled: board and committee composition; board culture;\nboard and committee focus; board process; and information\nresources. Composition. Through the self-evaluation\nprocess, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills,\nand experience of potential director candidates that are\nconsistent with the company\u0092s current strategy, allow the\nBoard to effectively perform its risk oversight\nresponsibilities, and that would add to the Board\u0092s\ndiversity. Board culture. Our Board considers its role in\nsetting the standard for the company\u0092s culture and values\nby forging a collegial and collaborative dynamic that\nvalues independent judgment and emphasizes\naccountability. As part of this review, directors\nevaluate how they interact among themselves, and with\nmanagement, including the importance of challenging and\nholding management accountable, and their relationships\nwith investors. Focus. Our Board and committees consider\ntheir critical oversight responsibilities, including\nstrategy, risk, and ESG, and succession planning for the\nBoard and the Lead Independent Director. Our Board and\ncommittees continuously reassess their focus and\nregularly engage in dialogue and solicit feedback from\nmanagement, shareholders, and other stakeholders and\nreceive third-party perspectives on the competitive\nenvironment, opportunities for growth, macroeconomic\ntrends, geopolitics, and cyber and information security.\nProcess. As part of the self-evaluation process,\ndirectors review overall Board and committee structure,\nquality of meeting materials and presentations, agenda\ntopics, and other meeting processes. Each of our\ndirectors meets with management and with our Lead\nIndependent Director through a combination of executive\nsessions, smaller group sessions, and one-on-one\nmeetings. Directors are focused on Board and committee\nmeeting structure so as to allow ample time for\ndiscussion, debate, and in-depth review of key topics and\ntrends. Information and resources. Through the self-\nevaluation process, our Board and committees evaluate the\nmaterials, education, and training opportunities they\nreceive both from management and outside advisors and\nexperts. Our directors continue to highlight the need for\nclear, comprehensive, and concise information to\neffectively support their oversight responsibilities. In\nparticular, directors have highlighted the importance of\nwell-organized, streamlined, and accessible materials\nthat identify key issues in a timely manner. Our\nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee\ndeveloped the formal 2020 self- evaluation to solicit\ndirector feedback on these key areas, the results of\nwhich are shared with management as appropriate. The\nCommittee also considered industry trends, practices of\nour peers, feedback from shareholders, and regulatory\ndevelopments. For the formal 2020 self- evaluation, the\nCommittee solicited directors\u0092 views on actions taken in\nresponse to the prior year\u0092s evaluation, and input on\nadditional topics relating to the health crisis and the\nremote operating environment, and feedback from the\nshareholder engagement discussions. As part of its\nongoing review of Board and committee composition, the\nCommittee also continued to seek input on the Board\u0092s\ndirector succession planning process, including Lead\nIndependent Director successor planning.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    21  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Enhancements made in response to\nformal Board

education is vital to the\nability of directors to fulfill their roles, and supports\nBoard members in their continuous learning. The Board\nencourages directors to participate annually in external\ncontinuing director education programs, and our company\nreimburses directors for their expenses associated with\nthis participation. Our directors also attend forums and\nconferences convened by our primary banking regulators.\nContinuing director education is also provided during\nBoard meetings and other Board discussions as part of the\nformal meetings, and as stand-alone information sessions\noutside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2020, our\nBoard heard from our primary banking regulators, global\nmanagement advisors, an infectious disease expert, and\nfrom management on numerous subjects, including current\ngeopolitical events, cybersecurity, digital banking,\nhuman capital management, including diversity and\ninclusion, and the COVID-19pandemic and many related\nconsiderations. All new directors also participate in our\ndirector orientation program during their first six\nmonths on our Board. New directors have a series of\nmeetings over time with management representatives from\nall of our business and staff areas to review and\ndiscuss, with increasing detail, information about our\ncompany, industry, and regulatory framework. Based on\ninput from our directors, we believe this gradual on-\nboardingapproach over the first six months of Board\nservice, coupled with participation in regular Board and\ncommittee meetings, provides new directors with a strong\nfoundation in our company\u0092s businesses, connects\ndirectors with members of management with whom they will\ninteract and oversee, and accelerates their effectiveness\nto engage fully in Board deliberations. Directors have\naccess to additional orientation and educational\nopportunities upon acceptance of new or additional\nresponsibilities on the Board and in committees. CEO and\nsenior management succession planning Our Board oversees\nCEO and senior management succession planning, which is\nformally reviewed at least annually; two such planning\nsessions were held in 2020. Our CEO and our Chief Human\nResources Officer provide our Board with recommendations\nand evaluations of potential CEO successors, and review\ntheir development progress. Our Board reviews potential\ninternal senior management candidates with our CEO and\nour Chief Human Resources Officer, including the\nqualifications, experience, and development priorities\nfor these individuals. Directors engage with potential\nCEO and senior management successors at Board and\ncommittee meetings and in less formal settings to allow\ndirectors to personally assess candidates. Further, our\nBoard periodically reviews the overall composition of our\nsenior management\u0092s qualifications, tenure, and\nexperience. In 2020, the Board also reviewed our\nstrategies for enhancing representation of, and\nprofessional development for, our diverse teammates for\neach of our eight lines of business and each of our staff\nareas, including information about representation at\nmanagement levels. Our Board also establishes steps to\naddress emergency CEO and senior management succession\nplanning in extraordinary circumstances. Our emergency\nCEO succession planning is intended to enable our company\nto respond to unexpected position vacancies, including\nthose resulting from a major catastrophe, by continuing\nour company\u0092s safe and sound operation and minimizing\npotential disruption or loss of continuity to our\ncompany\u0092s business and operations.\n                         \n  22    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Board meetings and attendance\nDirectors are expected to attend our annual meetings of\nshareholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each\nof our incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the\naggregate meetings of our Board and the committees on\nwhich they served during 2020.

Our purpose and\nvalues form the foundation of our culture\u0097a culture that\nis rooted in accountability, disciplined risk management,\nand delivering together as a team to better serve our\nclients, strengthen our communities, and deliver value to\nour shareholders. This all comes together as an engine\nfor sustainable Responsible Growth. Our culture comes\nfrom how we run the company every day, by acting\nresponsibly and managing risk well, which includes our\ncommitments to ethical behavior, acting with integrity,\nand complying with laws, rules, regulations, and policies\nthat reinforce such behavior. Managing risk is central to\neverything we do. Our success relies on the intellectual\ncuriosity and sound judgment of every employee across the\ncompany. Conduct and culture Our Board and its committees\nplay a key role in oversight of our culture, setting the\n\u0093tone at the top\u0094 and holding management accountable for\nits maintenance of high ethical standards and effective\npolicies and practices to protect our reputation, assets,\nand business. Our Board and its committees do this in a\nnumber of ways, including by:\n                                                         \n      prioritizing the importance of the character,      \n      integrity, and qualifications of each individual   \n      member, and the overall Board                      \n      and committee leadership structures and            \n      composition;                                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      overseeing management\u0092s identification,             \n      measurement, monitoring, and control of our        \n      material risks, including                          \n      compliance risk and conduct risk;                  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      regularly requesting and receiving briefings from  \n      senior management on matters relating to           \n      compliance and business conduct                    \n      risk;                                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      holding management accountable for the timely      \n      escalation of issues for review with the Board     \n      and its committees; and                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      overseeing our incentive plan design and           \n      governance processes to provide for an             \n      appropriate balance of risk and compensation       \n      outcomes                                           \n                                                         \nOur risk governance documents Risk is inherent in all of\nour business activities. One of our tenets of Responsible\nGrowth is: \u0093we must grow within our risk framework.\u0094 We\nexecute on that strategy through our commitment to\nresponsible and rigorous risk management and through a\ncomprehensive approach with a defined Risk Framework and\na well-articulated Risk Appetite Statement. The Risk\nFramework and Risk Appetite Statement are regularly\nreviewed with an eye towards enhancements and\nimprovements. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles,\nresponsibilities, and accountability for the management\nof risk and describes how our Board oversees the\nestablishment of our risk appetite, including both\nquantitative limits and qualitative statements and\nobjectives for our activities. This framework of\nobjective, independent Board oversight and management\u0092s\nrobust risk management better enables us to serve our\ncustomers, deliver long-term value for our shareholders,\nand achieve our strategic objectives. Our Risk Framework\nserves as the foundation for consistent and effective\nrisk management. It outlines the seven types of risk that\nour company faces\u0097strategic risk, credit risk, market\nrisk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including model,\nconduct, and cyber risk), compliance risk, and\nreputational risk\u0097and addresses climate risk and legal\nrisk. It describes components of our risk management\napproach, including our culture of managing risk well,\nrisk appetite, and risk management processes, with a\nfocus on the role of all employees in managing risk. It\nalso outlines our risk management governance structure,\nincluding the roles of our Board, management, lines of\nbusiness, independent risk management, and corporate\naudit within the governance structure. Our Risk Appetite\nStatement defines the aggregate levels and types of risk\nour Board and management believe appropriate to achieve\nour company\u0092s strategic objectives and business plans.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    25  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Our directors bring relevant risk\nmanagement oversight experience; see \u0093Our director\nnominees\u0094 on page 5. Our Chief Risk Officer, the\ncompany\u0092s senior-most risk manager, reports jointly to\nthe CEO and Enterprise Risk Committee, and participates\nin Board and Enterprise Risk Committee meetings. This\ngovernance structure is designed to complement our\nBoard\u0092s commitment to maintaining an objective,\nindependent Board and committee leadership structure, and\nto fostering integrity over risk management throughout\nour company and further demonstrates our commitment to a\nstrong culture of compliance, governance, and ethical\nconduct. We believe our holistic, ongoing Board and\ncommittee risk oversight process provides the foundation\nfor consistent and effective management of risks facing\nour company and demonstrates our commitment to a culture\nof rigorous risk management and compliance. Details of\nour company\u0092s risk management policies and practices are\ndescribed in \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094 in our\n2020 Annual Report. Board oversight of cybersecurity and\ninformation security risk Our Board recognizes the\nimportance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our\ncustomers, clients, and employees. As a part of its\nobjective, independent oversight of the key risks facing\nour company, the Board devotes significant time and\nattention to data and systems protection, including\ncybersecurity and information security risk. The Board\noversees management\u0092s approach to staffing, policies,\nprocesses, and practices sufficient to effectively gauge\nand address cybersecurity and information security risk.\nOur Board and Enterprise Risk Committee each receive\nregular presentations and reports throughout the year on\ncybersecurity and information security risk. These\npresentations and reports address a broad range of\ntopics, including updates on technology trends,\nregulatory developments, legal issues, policies and\npractices, the threat environment and vulnerability\nassessments, and specific and ongoing efforts to prevent,\ndetect, and respond to internal and external critical\nthreats. At least twice each year, the Board discusses\ncybersecurity and information security risks with our\nChief Operations and Technology Officer and our Chief\nInformation Security Officer.\n                         \n  26    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance The\nBoard receives prompt and\ntimely information from\nmanagement on any\ncybersecurity or information\nsecurity incident that may\npose significant risk to our\ncompany and continues to\nreceive regular reports on\nthe incident until its\nconclusion.

Each year, the Committee\nreviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive\ncompensation statement, or \u0093tally sheet,\u0094 for each\nexecutive officer. The tally sheets reflect each\nexecutive officer\u0092s total compensation, including base\nsalary, cash and equity-based incentive awards, the value\nof prior restricted stock unit awards (including the\nstatus of achieving any performance goals), qualified and\nnonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit\naccruals, and the incremental cost to our company of the\nexecutive\u0092s perquisites. The Committee uses this\ninformation to evaluate all elements of compensation and\nbenefits provided to an executive officer. Annually, the\nCommittee reviews with our Board its compensation\ndecisions (including cash and equity-based incentive\nawards, if applicable) for executives who report directly\nto our CEO. With respect to the CEO\u0092s compensation, the\nCommittee makes a recommendation that is further reviewed\nand approved by the independent members of the Board. The\nCEO does not participate in Committee or Board\ndeliberations about his compensation. Additionally, for\nour Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the\nCommittee\u0092s pay recommendations are further reviewed and\napproved by our Board\u0092s Enterprise Risk Committee and\nAudit Committee, respectively. Executive officers do not\nengage with the Committee in setting the amount or form\nof their own individual compensation. During annual\nperformance reviews for executive officers other than our\nCEO, the Committee considers our CEO\u0092s perspective and\nincentive award recommendations before approving\ncompensation for each of these executive officers. In\naddition, the Committee considers the performance of our\nvarious lines of business, business segments and\nfunctions, as well as performance feedback from our Chief\nHuman Resources Officer and our independent control\nfunctions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance,\nHuman Resources, and Legal).\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    27  \n                              \nCorporate Governance The Committee has the sole authority\nand responsibility under its charter to approve engaging\nany compensation consultant it uses and the fees for\nthose services. The Committee retained Farient Advisors\nLLC (Farient Advisors) as its 2020 independent\ncompensation consultant. Farient Advisors\u0092 business with\nus is limited to providing independent executive and\ndirector compensation consulting services. Farient\nAdvisors does not provide any other services to our\ncompany. For 2020, Farient Advisors provided the\nCommittee external market and performance comparisons,\nadvised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and\ndirector compensation, assisted in evaluating program\ndesign, and assisted with other executive and director\ncompensation-related matters. In performing these\nservices, Farient Advisors met regularly with the\nCommittee without management and privately with the Chair\nof the Committee. The Committee may delegate to\nmanagement certain duties and responsibilities regarding\nour benefit plans. Significant Committee delegations to\nmanagement include authority to: (i) the Management\nCompensation Committee to direct the compensation for all\nof our employees except for our CEO and his direct\nreports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to\noversee substantially all of our employee benefit plans.\nSee \u0093Compensation governance structure\u0094 below.\nCompensation risk management policies and practices Our\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee is committed to\na compensation governance structure that effectively\ncontributes to our company\u0092s overall risk management\npolicies. Compensation governance policy. The Committee\nhas adopted and annually reviews our Compensation\nGovernance Policy, which governs our incentive\ncompensation decisions and defines the framework for\noversight of enterprise-wide incentive compensation\nprogram design. Consistent with global regulatory\ninitiatives, our Compensation Governance Policy requires\nthat our incentive compensation plans do not encourage\nexcessive risk-taking.\n                                      \n  Our Compensation Governance Policy  \n  addresses...                        \n                                      \n                                                         \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Definition and process    \u0095\u2002\u2009Policies on incentive    \n  for identifying             compensation plan          \n  \u0093risk-taking\u0094 employees       effectiveness through      \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Key goals and process     testing and monitoring to  \n  for incentive               confirm that the plans     \n  compensation plan design    appropriately balance      \n  and governance to           risks with compensation    \n  appropriately balance       outcomes,                  \n  risks with compensation     including developing       \n  outcomes, including:        processes to administer    \n  O\u00a0\u00a0funding                  cancellations and          \n  incentive compensation      clawbacks                  \n  pools O\u00a0\u00a0determining        \u0095\u2002\u2009Policies that provide    \n  individual incentive        for the independence       \n  compensation awards         of our company\u0092s            \n  O\u00a0\u00a0use                      independent control        \n  of discretion as part of    functions and their        \n  those processes             appropriate input to the   \n                              Committee                  \n                                                         \nCompensation governance structure. Our compensation\ngovernance structure allocates responsibility so that our\nBoard, Compensation and Human Capital Committee, or the\nappropriate management-level governing body makes\ncompensation decisions with documented input from the\nindependent control functions. This approach promotes\neffective oversight and review and facilitates the\nappropriate governance to balance risk and reward. Below\nis an illustration of our compensation governance\nstructure, which is influenced by internal considerations\nand external factors:\n                         \n  28    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Incentive plan certification\nprocess. Pursuant to our Compensation Governance Policy,\nour annual incentive plan certification and review\nprocess provides for a comprehensive review, analysis,\nand discussion of incentive design and operation. As part\nof the governance for incentive plans, each of the CEO\u0092s\ndirect reports, along with their management teams and\nindependent control functions (including their respective\nrisk officers), meet periodically to discuss how business\nstrategy, performance, and risk align to compensation.\nThe relevant participants certify that the incentive\nprograms they review: (i) are aligned with the applicable\nlines of business and our company\u0092s business strategy and\nperformance objectives, (ii) do not encourage excessive\nor imprudent risk-taking beyond our company\u0092s ability to\neffectively identify and manage risk, (iii) are\ncompatible with effective controls and risk management,\nand (iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary\ntrading. Our Chief Risk Officer also certifies all\nincentive plans across our company as part of the\nManagement Compensation Committee\u0092s governance process.\nFarient Advisors and the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee review these management certifications.\nIncentive plan audit reviews. Corporate Audit annually\nreviews the operational effectiveness of the incentive\ncompensation program end to end, using a risk-based\napproach to evaluate plan design (including in-year\nchanges/enhancements), pay execution, program governance,\nand conformity with regulatory requirements. Conduct\nreviews. As part of our compensation governance\npractices, management reviews the results of the conduct\nreview process so that conduct is consistently and\nappropriately considered in performance assessments and\npay decisions across the company. These performance and\npay outcomes are reviewed at least annually by the\nCommittee. Independent control function feedback. In\naddition to reviewing the individual incentive\ncompensation awards for executive officers and other\nsenior executives who report directly to the CEO, the\nCommittee also reviews the outcomes of our control\nfunction feedback process and individual incentive\ncompensation awards for certain highly compensated\nemployees. As part of its governance process, the\nCommittee meets with the heads of our independent control\nfunctions and business lines to discuss their feedback on\nthe pay-for-performanceprocess, including how risk\nmanagement and conduct matters were factored into\ncompensation decisions. These processes and reviews, in\ncombination with risk management and clawback features,\nare key components of our compensation programs. These\nprograms are designed to appropriately hold employees\naccountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a way\nthat does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-\ntaking or create risks that are reasonably likely to have\na material adverse effect on our company. Hedging policy.\nUnder our Code of Conduct and other policies, all Bank of\nAmerica directors, executive officers, and certain other\ndesignated insiders are prohibited from hedging and\nspeculative trading of Bank of America securities. They\nmay not engage in short sales or trading in puts, calls,\nand other options or derivatives with respect to our\nsecurities. All other employees may not engage in any\nsuch transactions other than transactions that hedge\nagainst an existing long position in our securities if\nthe shares underlying the position are readily available\nfor sale or delivery. No employee may hedge the value of\noutstanding restricted stock units or other equity-based\nawards, and such awards may be forfeited or recouped for\nviolation of our anti-hedging and derivative transactions\npolicies.

Our Investor\nRelations team regularly meets with investors,\nprospective investors, and investment analysts. These\nmeetings often include participation by our Chairman and\nCEO, Chief Financial Officer, or line of business\nleaders, and they generally are focused on company\nperformance, strategy, and Responsible Growth. Our Board\nand management also regularly engage with our\nshareholders to solicit their views and input on company\nperformance, corporate governance, ESG, and other topics\nof interest to them, such as environmental initiatives,\nhuman capital management, and executive compensation\nmatters. The combination of information received in\ninvestor relations meetings and shareholder engagement\nmeetings provides the Board and management with insights\ninto a comprehensive scope of topics important to our\nshareholders.

Year-\nround engagement and Board reporting. Our Corporate\nSecretary, Investor Relations, ESG, and Human Resources\nteams, together with executive management members and\ndirectors, conduct regular, year-round outreach to\nshareholders in-person(when possible) and by phone to\nobtain their input on key matters and to inform our\nmanagement and our Board about the issues that our\nshareholders tell us matter most to them. Throughout the\nyear, our Corporate Secretary team provides periodic\ncompany updates by email to our largest shareholders,\ndriving awareness of our significant corporate governance\nmatters, environmental initiatives, and community\nimpacts, and changes in our Board. We also continue to\nimprove our engagement and communications with our retail\nshareholders, including employee shareholders. These\nefforts led to the development of our dedicated retail\nshareholder annual meeting webpage, which includes videos\nfrom our Board, addressing topics such as governance,\nmanagement oversight, and our Responsible Growth, and\nresources such as our Human Capital Management Report.\nTransparent and informed governance enhancements. Our\nBoard routinely reviews and improves our governance\npractices and policies, including our shareholder\nengagement practices. Shareholder input is regularly\nshared with our Board, its committees, and management,\nfacilitating a dialogue that provides shareholders with\ntransparency into our governance practices and\nconsiderations, and informs our company\u0092s enhancement of\nthose practices. In addition to shareholder sentiments,\nour Board considers trends in governance practices and\nregularly reviews the voting results of our meetings of\nshareholders, the governance practices of our peers and\nother large companies, and current trends in governance.\nSee page 32 for additional detail on recent governance\nenhancements our Board implemented. Our 2020 and early\n2021 shareholder engagement initiatives Our directors and\nmanagement met with our large shareholders holding\napproximately 24% of our shares outstanding and key\nstakeholders throughout 2020 and in early 2021 to obtain\ntheir input and to discuss their views on our Board\u0092s\nindependent oversight of management, our Board\u0092s\ncomposition and director succession planning and\nrecruitment, and our Board\u0092s oversight of our\nenvironmental and social initiatives, and human capital\nmanagement practices, among other issues important to our\nshareholders. These views were shared with our Board and\nits committees, where applicable, for their\nconsideration. In March and April of 2020, our Lead\nIndependent Director and management met with shareholders\nto discuss our company\u0092s initial response to the health\ncrisis arising from the coronavirus pandemic. The\ndiscussions focused on the strength of our balance sheet,\nour efforts to promote the health and safety of our\nemployees and their families, and our business continuity\nplan. Following these discussion, we provided additional\ntransparency by publishing a second edition of the Human\nCapital Management Report in October 2020 to provide the\nlatest information on our company\u0092s response to the\nhealth crisis in support of our employees and their\nfamilies, as well as updated information about diversity\nand inclusion data and representation of women and people\nof color in our workforce and management. Beginning in\nthe fall of 2020 through January 2021, our Lead\nIndependent Director and management again met with\nshareholders; they were joined by Mr. Nowell, our Lead\nIndependent Director successor, who was introduced to the\nshareholders. The directors shared information about the\nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee\nand Board\u0092s Lead Independent Director succession planning\nprogress, and discussed our Board\u0092s oversight of\nmanagement and our company\u0092s response to the global\nhealth and humanitarian crisis, including the work to\nsupport our teammates, clients, and communities. More\nbroadly, we sent periodic company updates to our largest\n250 shareholders representing approximately 61% of our\nshares outstanding throughout 2020, including upon\npublication of our 2020 update to the Human Capital\nManagement Report. To further our engagement with all\nshareholders, including retail and employee shareholders,\nwe significantly enhanced our annual meeting webpage in\n2019 and continue to refine the webpage to provide\nshareholders with a platform to easily access information\nabout our annual meeting, our director nominees, and the\nmatters for shareholder vote.

Through\nour commitment to Responsible Growth and our ESG\nleadership, we build trust and credibility as a company\npeople want to work for, invest in, and do business with.\nAt Bank of America, we are driving sustainable\nResponsible Growth through a strong focus on ESG\nleadership. Our management-level Global ESG Committee,\nwhich is led by our Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, is\ncomprised of senior executives from across the company\nwho are actively engaged in managing our ESG approach and\nstrengthening our governance. The committee engages in\ndialogue and debate on social and environmental issues\nthat are significant to our business, including our human\ncapital management practices, product and service\nofferings, business investments, and client selection\nwith the goal of creating a sustainable economy. The\ncommittee, which is accountable to our CEO, convenes six\ntimes a year and reports regularly to the Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee. As part of\nthese efforts, in January 2020 we established a\nSustainable Markets Committee, co-chairedby Vice Chairman\nAnne Finucane and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Tom\nMontag, to accelerate our progress, identify new\nopportunities, and build upon our work in sustainable\nfinance including helping accelerate the transition to a\nlow-carboneconomy. Through the Sustainable Markets\nCommittee, we are driving consistent perspective and\nfocus on all we are doing in sustainable finance, from\npolicy and research to the deployment of capital and\ndevelopment of investment products across all our\nbusiness and client bases. We engage with shareholders,\nconsumer advocates, community advisors, and other\nstakeholders for their advice and guidance in shaping our\npolicies and practices. In 2005, we founded our National\nCommunity Advisory Council, a forum made up of senior\nleaders from social justice, consumer advocacy, community\ndevelopment, environmental, research, and other advocacy\norganizations who solicit external perspectives, guidance\nand feedback on our business policies, practices, and\nproducts. This is just one of the many ways we engage\nglobally and take into account a wide range of\nperspectives as we make decisions as a company.

As the public sector and\nnonprofits cannot fill this gap alone, private sector\nengagement is critical. Our enterprise-wide focus on\nsustainable finance taps the power and scale of the\ncapital markets to deliver on both profitability and\nprogress. It is designed to unlock the necessary\nfinancing to address these major global and local\nchallenges such as affordable housing, sustainable\nenergy, clean water and sanitation, education, and health\ncare. In 2020, we mobilized and deployed approximately\n$100 billion in capital annually to address these issues.\nThrough the combined resources and expertise of the\nglobal financial community, government, and nonprofit\norganizations, we can address problems through business\ndecisions that improve our communities, generate growth,\nand lead to a return on investment.

Since 2007 when it    \n      was launched, we have\u00a0mobilized more than $200     \n      billion to these efforts across the globe.         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Tax equity for renewables: We have been the top    \n      tax equity investor in the U.S. since              \n      2015.

We maintain robust policies and practices\nthat reinforce equal pay for equal work, including\nreviews with oversight from our Board and senior leaders.\nFor over a decade, we have conducted rigorous processes\nand analyses with outside experts to examine individual\nemployee pay before year-endcompensation decisions are\nfinalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate.\nWe also have a standard U.S. practice that restricts the\nsolicitation of compensation information from candidates\nduring our hiring process. This helps ensure that we\nconsider new hires for their individual qualifications\nand roles, rather than how they may have been previously\ncompensated. We believe our pay-for-\nperformanceapproach\u0097combined with our focus on workforce\nrepresentation\u0097will continue driving the advancement and\nrepresentation of women and people of color in our\ncompany. In 2020, we continued to compensate our\nemployees fairly and equitably as demonstrated through\nour equal pay of equal work review. Similar to 2019, our\n2020 review covered our regional leadership hubs (U.S.,\nU.K., France, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and\nIndia. Results of this equal pay for equal work review\nshowed: Competitive compensation We pay our employees\nfairly based on market rates for their roles, experience,\nand how they perform, and we regularly benchmark against\nother companies both within and outside our industry to\nhelp ensure our pay is competitive. We are an industry\nleader in establishing an internal minimum rate of pay\nabove all mandated minimums for our U.S. hourly\nemployees, and have made regular increases over the past\nseveral years. Our minimum hourly wage for U.S. teammates\nwas raised to $20 in the first quarter of 2020, more than\none year earlier than planned. With our teammates called\nupon to address unprecedented challenges and headwinds in\nthe broader environment, working in support of each\nother, our clients and the communities where we work and\nlive, in first quarter 2021 we recognized employees with\nDelivering Together compensation awards. These awards\nbuild on the Shared Success awards announced to employees\nin the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Our policy covers any transactions\nwhere the aggregate amount involved will or may be\nexpected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our\ncompany is a participant, and a related person has or\nwill have a direct or indirect material interest. Under\nour related person transactions policy, our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee must\napprove or ratify any related person transactions, and\nwhen doing so, consider: the related person\u0092s interest in\nthe transaction; whether the transaction involves\narm\u0092s-lengthbids or market prices and terms; the\ntransaction\u0092s materiality to each party; the availability\nof the product or services through other sources; the\nimplications of our Code of Conduct or reputational risk;\nwhether the transaction would impair a director\u0092s or\nexecutive officer\u0092s judgment to act in our company\u0092s best\ninterest; the transaction\u0092s acceptability to our\nregulators; and in the case of an independent director,\nwhether the transaction would impair his or her\nindependence or status as an \u0093outside\u0094 or \u0093non-\nemployee\u0094director. Our Board has determined that certain\ntypes of transactions do not create or involve a direct\nor indirect material interest on the part of the related\nperson and therefore do not require review or approval\nunder the policy. These include transactions involving\nfinancial services, including: loans and brokerage;\nbanking, insurance, investment advisory, or asset\nmanagement services; and other financial services we\nprovide to any related person, if the services are\nprovided in the ordinary course of business, on\nsubstantially the same terms as those prevailing at the\ntime for comparable services provided to non-\naffiliates,and comply with applicable law, including the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board\nRegulation O. A number of our directors, director\nnominees, and executive officers, their family members,\nand certain business organizations associated with them\nare or have been customers of our banking subsidiaries.\nAll extensions of credit to these persons have been made\nin the ordinary course of business on substantially the\nsame terms, including interest rates and collateral, as\nthose prevailing at the time in comparable transactions\nwith persons not related to our company and did not\ninvolve more than the normal risk of collectability.\nOccasionally, we may have employees who are related to\nour executive officers, directors, or director nominees.\nWe compensate these individuals in a manner consistent\nwith our practices that apply to all employees. The\nsister of Mr. Thong M. Nguyen, an executive officer, and\nthe brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee, are\neach employed by the company in non-executive, non-\nstrategicpositions, and each received compensation in\n2020 of approximately $180,000 and $300,000,\nrespectively. Dr. Zuber\u0092s brother\u0092s compensation is\nprimarily commissions based. The methodology through\nwhich his compensation is calculated is consistent with\nthat used for other financial advisors in similar roles.\nThe compensation and other terms of employment of both\nMr. Nguyen\u0092s sister and Dr. Zuber\u0092s brother are\ndetermined on a basis consistent with the company\u0092s human\nresources policies.

Annual payments are made after the\ndirectors are elected by shareholders.

The number of restricted shares awarded is equal\nto the dollar value of the award divided by the closing\nprice of our common stock on the NYSE on the grant date,\nrounded down to the next whole share, with cash paid for\nany fractional share. Dividends are paid on the award\nwhen they are paid on shares of our common stock. The\nannual restricted stock award is subject to a one-\nyearvesting requirement. If a director retires before the\none-yearvesting date, a prorated amount of the award\nvests based on the number of days the director served\nduring the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested\namount of the award is forfeited. 2020 Director\ncompensation review Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee annually reviews and periodically recommends\nupdates to the director compensation program to our Board\nfor approval. The Committee\u0092s recommendation takes into\naccount our director compensation philosophy, changes in\nmarket practices, and consultation with the Committee\u0092s\nindependent compensation consultant, Farient Advisors. No\nchanges were made to the form or amount of director\ncompensation as part of the 2020 review. Director\ndeferral plan Non-managementdirectors may elect to defer\nall or a portion of their annual restricted stock or cash\nawards through the Bank of America Corporation Director\nDeferral Plan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors\nelect to defer their restricted stock award, their \u0093stock\naccount\u0094 is credited with \u0093stock units\u0094 equal in value to\nthe restricted stock award and subject to the same\nvesting requirement applicable to restricted stock awards\nto directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a\nshare of our common stock but because it is not an actual\nshare of our common stock, it does not have any voting\nrights. When directors elect to defer their cash award,\nthey may choose to defer into either a stock account or a\n\u0093cash account.\u0094 Deferrals into a stock account are\ncredited with dividend equivalents in the form of\nadditional stock units and deferrals into the cash\naccount are credited with interest at a long-term bond\nrate. Following retirement from our Board and depending\non the director\u0092s selection, a non-managementdirector may\nreceive the stock account balance (to the extent vested)\nand cash account balance in a single lump-sum cash\npayment or in a series of cash installment payments.\nStock retention requirements and hedging prohibition for\ndirectors\n                                                         \n      Under our stock retention requirements,            \n      non-management directors are required to           \n      hold and cannot sell the restricted stock they     \n      receive as compensation (except as necessary to    \n      pay taxes on taxable events such as vesting)       \n      until termination of their service.

At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, a\nmajority of shareholders voted to have a \u0093Say on Pay\u0094\nvote each year. As a result, we will conduct an advisory\nvote on executive compensation annually at least until\nthe next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of\nsuch votes. Although the \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 vote is advisory\nand is not binding on our Board, our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee will take into consideration the\noutcome of the vote when making future executive\ncompensation decisions. At the 2020 annual meeting of\nshareholders, nearly 95% of the votes cast favored our\n\u0093Say on Pay\u0094 proposal. The Committee considered this\nresult and input from investors during our shareholder\nengagement process, and in light of the strong support,\nmaintained a consistent overall approach for 2020. Our\nBoard has designed our current executive compensation\nprogram to appropriately link compensation realized by\nour executive officers to our performance and properly\nalign the interests of our executive officers with those\nof our shareholders. The details of this compensation for\n2020, and the reasons we awarded it, are described in\n\u0093Compensation discussion and analysis,\u0094 starting below.\n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094 approving our     \n  executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding  \n  \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 resolution) (Proposal 2).              \n                                                    \nOur Board recommends that our shareholders vote in favor\nof the following resolution: \u0093Resolved, that our\nshareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the\ncompensation of our company\u0092s named executive officers,\nas disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure\nrules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the\ncompensation tables, and the accompanying narrative\ndiscussion disclosed in this proxy statement.\u0094\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n                                                         \n  1.

The \u0093Pay evaluation & decision process\u0094\nsection on page 56 presents the range of performance and\ngovernance considerations that the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee considers as inputs into compensation\ndecisions. These factors are evaluated each year and have\nremained generally consistent over time as part of a\nbalanced and disciplined approach to the compensation\ndecision process. Within that broader framework, the\n\u00932020 Company & segment performance\u0094 section on page 50\nhighlights key company and segment performance\nconsiderations for 2020, including the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the \u0093Individual performance\nhighlights\u0094 section on page 57 focuses on performance for\neach of our named executive officers. These\nconsiderations reinforce and promote Responsible Growth\nand maintain alignment with our Risk Framework. Our\nexecutive compensation program provides a mix of salary,\nincentives, and benefits paid over time to align\nexecutive officer and shareholder interests. Our\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee has the primary\nresponsibility for approving our compensation strategy\nand philosophy, and the compensation programs applicable\nto our named executive officers listed below. With\nrespect to Mr. Moynihan\u0092s compensation, our Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee makes a recommendation that\nis further reviewed and approved by the independent\nmembers of the Board.\n                                                         \n  Named executive                                        \n  officers                                               \n  Brian T.

Executive\ncompensation program features a. Executive pay components\n& variable pay mix Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee determines the pay for our named executive\nofficers for each performance year. Our pay-for-\nperformancestructure is designed to emphasize variable\npay and help motivate our executives to deliver sustained\nshareholder value and Responsible Growth. Restricted\nstock units are divided into the following components:\ncash-settled (CEO only), time-based and performance-\nbased. The CEO\u0092s cash-settled restricted stock units\ncontinue to vest over one year. Time-based restricted\nstock units vest ratably over four years, increased from\nthree years in 2019, to further drive long-term\nshareholder alignment. Our performance-based awards\ncontinue to use a re-earn approach, meaning 100% of the\naward is the maximum that can be earned, and vest only if\nperformance standards are met over a three-year period.\nFuture performance below these standards will decrease\nthe amount paid, and no PRSUs will be re-earned if\nresults are below the minimum standards.

Standards for performance restricted stock units Re-\nearning the PRSUs granted in February 2021 (based on 2020\nperformance) requires the company to meet average ROA and\naverage adjusted TBV growth standards (tax-normalized)\nover a three-year performance period from 2021-2023. In\nlight of company performance in 2020 and performance\nexpectations given the broader economic environment, the\nCommittee has recalibrated standards for average ROA,\nwhile making no changes to standards for average adjusted\nTBV growth. Furthermore, in consideration of the\nCommittee setting standards based on the information and\nassumed tax policies available at the time and to\nmaintain the intended incentives and economics of awards\nduring the performance period, for the PRSUs granted in\n2021, metric results will be normalized for the material\neffects of any tax changes as outlined below. As has been\nconsistent practice, the Committee does not exercise\ndiscretion to change payouts and there is no change to\nthe standards for previously granted but not yet vested\nperformance RSU awards. Under a hypothetical scenario, if\nour 2020 ending assets of $2.8 trillion remained constant\nduring the performance period, our company would need to\nearn $67.7 billion in aggregate net income from 2021-2023\nto achieve the PRSU 0.8% average ROA growth standard. On\nan annualized basis, this equals approximately $22.6\nbillion in earnings which is 26% higher than 2020\nreported net income of $17.9 billion. These performance\nmetrics and standards encourage the achievement of\nsustained shareholder value and Responsible Growth. PRSUs\nare forfeited if results are below both minimum\nstandards. PRSUs granted since 2017 provide no upside\npayout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be re-\nearned for these awards). For any portion of the PRSU\nstandards achieved, payment will be made after the end of\nthe performance period. The performance year 2020 PRSU\nstandards are outlined below:\n                                                         \n            Three-year average                           \n            ROA                                          \n            (tax-normalized)(1)                          \n            (50% weighting)                              \n  Standard                           %\u00a0Earned            \n  <50bps                                           0  %  \n  50bps                                        331\u20443  %  \n  65bps                                        662\u20443  %  \n  \u00b380bps                                         100  %  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n            Three-year average                           \n            growth                                       \n            in adjusted TBV(2)                           \n            (50% weighting)                              \n  Standard                           %\u00a0Earned            \n  <5.25%                                           0  %  \n  5.25%                                        331\u20443  %  \n  7.00%                                        662\u20443  %  \n  \u00b38.50%                                         100  %  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n         Any results achieved above 331\u20443%               \n  Note:  will be interpolated on a straight-line basis   \n         between the two nearest standards.              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       Three-year average ROA (tax-normalized) means     \n       the average \u0093return on assets\u0094                      \n       for the three calendar years in the performance   \n       period.

Other\ncompensation topics a. Results for performance restricted\nstock units PRSUs have been a component of our executive\ncompensation program since 2011. PRSUs require our\nexecutive officers to re-earn awards over the performance\nperiod based on achievement of established performance\nstandards and help align management with shareholder\ninterests. Our practice is not to make discretionary\nadjustments to PRSU results for the impact of legacy\nlitigation, fines, and penalties, the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct, or impairment charges, which has contributed to\noutcomes for PRSU payouts since their introduction. Since\n2011, we have had two types of PRSU programs: 5-Year\nprogram (completed)\n                                                         \n      2011 and 2012 PRSUs were based on rolling          \n      four-quarter return on assets (ROA) standards      \n      over a five-year performance period.               \n                                                         \n3-Year program (current)\n                                                         \n      Since 2013, PRSUs have been based 50% on           \n      three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year       \n      average growth in adjusted TBV                     \n      standards, without adjustment for legacy           \n      litigation, fines, and penalties, the Tax Cuts     \n      and Jobs Act, or impairment charges.               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      The 2018 PRSUs completed in 2020 at 100% of the    \n      target opportunity, based on ROA results of 101    \n      bps and adjusted TBV results                       \n      of 11.08%. This is the maximum payout for this     \n      award.

For 2020,\nthese companies were: Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, Chevron,\nCisco, Coca-Cola, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, General\nElectric, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Pfizer,\nPhilip Morris International, Procter & Gamble, Verizon,\nand Wal-Mart.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    61  \n                              \nCompensation discussion and analysis c. Retirement\nbenefits We provide our named executive officers the\nopportunity to save for their retirement via employee and\nemployer contributions to qualified and nonqualified\ndefined contribution plans on the same terms as other\nU.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us\nattract and retain key people by providing a means to\nsave for retirement. Certain named executive officers\nalso participate in various frozen qualified and\nnonqualified defined benefit pension plans. For more\ninformation about these plans, see \u0093Pension benefits\ntable\u0094 and \u0093Nonqualified deferred compensation table\u0094 on\npages 69 and 70, respectively. d. Health and welfare\nbenefits & perquisites Our named executive officers\nreceive health and welfare benefits, such as medical,\nlife, and long-term disability coverage, under plans\ngenerally available to all other U.S.-based salaried\nemployees; in addition, our named executive officers are\neligible to receive an annual physical exam. Because we\nhave internal expertise on financial advisory matters, we\ndo not charge fees to our named executive officers for\ntheir use of our financial advisory services for personal\nneeds. We also may provide certain named executive\nofficers with secured parking. For information security\npurposes and efficiency, certain named executive officers\nare permitted to use a car service when commuting to and\nfrom our offices or business-related events;\nparticipating named executive officers reimburse the\ncompany for incremental costs incurred. In limited\ncircumstances, we may occasionally provide meals and\nallow spouses or guests to accompany executives traveling\nfor a business-related purpose and pay for other\nincidental expenses. Our policy provides for the use of\ncorporate aircraft by senior management for approved\ntravel. For reasons of security, personal safety, and\nefficiency, we require our CEO to use corporate aircraft\nfor all air travel (business, commuting, and personal).\nPursuant to his aircraft time-sharing agreement, our CEO\nreimburses our company for costs related to his use of\nour aircraft for commuting. Our executive officers,\nincluding our named executive officers, other than our\nCEO, are permitted to use corporate aircraft for limited\npersonal travel with reimbursement to the company for\nincremental costs, pursuant to their aircraft time-\nsharing agreements. e. Tax deductibility of compensation\nU.S. tax law limits a public company\u0092s deductions to $1\nmillion per year for compensation paid to its CEO, chief\nfinancial officer, and each of its three other most\nhighly compensated executive officers, as well as to any\nindividual who was subject to the $1 million deduction\nlimitation in 2017 or any later year. There is no\nexception for qualifying performance-based compensation\nunless it is pursuant to a written binding contract in\neffect as of November 2, 2017 (the Transition Date).\nCertain annual cash incentive awards and equity-based\nincentive awards made on or before the Transition Date\nmay satisfy the requirements for deductible compensation\nand any compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a\ncovered person after 2017 will not be deductible unless\nit qualifies for transition relief. The Committee\ncontinues to retain the discretion to make awards and pay\namounts that do not qualify as deductible. Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee Report Our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee has reviewed and discussed with\nmanagement the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that\nimmediately precedes this report. Based on this review\nand discussion, our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee has recommended to our Board that the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this\nproxy statement and incorporated by reference into our\nannual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2020.

For the PRSUs granted    \n       in 2020, the actual number of PRSUs earned (0%    \n       up to the maximum level of 100%) will depend on   \n       our company\u0092s future achievement of specific ROA   \n  (5)  and growth in adjusted TBV standards over a       \n       three-year performance period ending December\u00a0    \n       31, 2022. Values in the \u0093Stock awards\u0094 column       \n       assume that 100% (the maximum level) of the       \n       PRSUs granted would vest as the probable outcome  \n       for purposes of determining the grant date fair   \n       value. The grant date fair value for the PRSUs    \n       and TRSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018          \n       includes a discount of approximately 10%, 10%     \n       and 11%, respectively, to reflect the impact of   \n       post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value   \n       of these awards.                                  \n       See \u0093Grants of plan-based awards table\u0094 on page 65  \n       for a description of the CRSUs, PRSUs, and TRSUs  \n       granted in 2020.                                  \n                                                         \n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    63  \n                              \nExecutive compensation\n                                                         \n       The following table shows the change in pension   \n  (6)  value and the amount of any above-market          \n       earnings on nonqualified deferred                 \n       compensation for the named executive officers:    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                     Above-mar\u2026          \n               Change\u00a0in             earnings\u00a0           \n               pension\u00a0              on\u00a0                 \n  Name         value                 nonqualif\u2026          \n               ($)                   deferred            \n                                     compensat\u2026          \n                                     ($)                 \n  Brian T.                574,945                99,029  \n  Moynihan                                               \n  Paul M.                 172,084                     0  \n  Donofrio                                               \n  Dean C.                  45,159                     0  \n  Athanasia                                              \n  Geoffrey                                               \n  S.                          628                     0  \n  Greener                                                \n  Thomas K.                     0                     0  \n  Montag                                                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  The \u0093Change in pension value\u0094 equals the change in the   \n  actuarial present value of all pension benefits from   \n  December\u00a031, 2019 to December\u00a031, 2020.                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  For this purpose, in accordance with SEC rules, the    \n  present value was determined using the same            \n  assumptions applicable for                             \n  valuing pension benefits for purposes of our           \n  financial statements.

Under his\naircraft time-sharing agreement, during 2020 Mr. Moynihan\nreimbursed our company for certain incremental costs of\nflights on our corporate aircraft for commuting purposes.\nMr. Moynihan is responsible for his own taxes on any\nimputed income resulting from his personal use of our\ncorporate aircraft.

The component plans are cash balance\npension plans where notional cash balance accounts grow\nbased on notional credits. As of June 30, 2012,\nparticipants no longer receive compensation credits or\nyears of credited service under the Legacy Pension Plan.\nParticipants in the legacy Fleet component plan continue\nto receive notional interest credits based on the one-\nyearU.S. Treasury Note yield, subject to a minimum annual\nrate of 3.25%. Participants in the legacy Bank of America\ncomponent plan continue to receive notional interest\ncredits based on the 10-yearU.S. Treasury Note yield for\ntheir post-2007 accounts and notional investment credits\nbased on selected investment choices for their\npre-2008accounts.

Deferred\ncompensation plan. Each of our named executive officers\nis eligible to participate in the Bank of America\nDeferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan),\nwhich is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that\nallows for deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified\nplans. Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of base\nsalary and up to 75% of certain eligible incentive\nawards. Employer contributions made under the plan, if\nany, when combined with the employer contributions under\nthe 401(k) plan, will not exceed the maximum employer\ncontributions allowable under the 401(k) Plan\u0097$12,500 for\nmatching contributions and $7,500 for annual company\ncontributions. Participants may generally elect to\nreceive their distribution in a lump-sum payment or\ninstallments payable up to 15 years. Participants are not\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that they\ndeferred or any notional investment earnings (based on\nelections of the same investment options as under the\n401(k) Plan) until those amounts are distributed to them,\nand we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until\nthey are distributed. Legacy deferred compensation plan.\nMessrs. Moynihan and Athanasia each have an account under\nthe FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Deferred\nCompensation Plan No. 2 (Legacy Deferred Compensation\nPlan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan.\nPrior to being closed to deferrals in 2002, participants\ncould defer base salary and certain bonuses under the\nplan. Participants can elect payments in a lump-sum or up\nto 15 annual installments either on or after termination\nof employment, but not beyond the year in which the\nparticipant turns 65. Legacy supplemental plan. Messrs.\nMoynihan and Athanasia each have an account under the\nFleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Supplemental\nPlan (Legacy Supplemental Plan), which is a nonqualified\nretirement savings plan that allowed deferrals above the\nIRS limits on qualified plans. This plan was closed to\ncontributions in 2004. Payments are made in a lump-sum or\nup to 15 annual installments beginning in the year of\ntermination of employment or any later year elected by\nthe participant, but not beyond the year in which the\nparticipant turns 65. Legacy ESA plan. Mr. Athanasia has\na nonqualified deferred compensation account that was\nestablished prior to FleetBoston\u0092s merger with Bank of\nAmerica Corporation and funded by employer contributions\n(Legacy ESA Plan). This plan was closed to contributions\nin 2004. Upon his termination of employment, Mr.\nAthanasia will be paid in equal installments over a one-\nyearrestrictive covenant period, unless he terminates due\nto death or disability. Potential payments upon\ntermination or change in control We do not have any\nagreements with our named executive officers that provide\nfor cash severance payments upon termination of\nemployment or a change in control. In addition, under our\npolicy regarding executive severance agreements, we will\nnot enter into employment or severance agreements with\nour executive officers that provide severance benefits\nexceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined\nunder our policy), unless the agreement has been approved\nby our shareholders. Potential payments from equity-based\nawards Our equity-based awards to our named executive\nofficers include standard provisions that cause awards to\nvest or be forfeited upon termination of employment,\ndepending on the reason for termination. These provisions\nfor awards granted in 2020 are described in more detail\non page 65, and those details can be found for awards\ngranted in prior years in our prior proxy statements. In\ngeneral, our awards provide for continued payments on the\noriginal schedule after certain types of termination of\nemployment, subject to the following conditions:\n                                                         \n      In case of a \u0093Qualifying Termination\u0094 (sometimes     \n      referred to in prior years as \u0093Rule of 60\u0094), the     \n      award                                              \n      continues to be paid according to the award\u0092s       \n      payment schedule if the executive complies with    \n      certain covenants, including not working for a     \n      competitive business. A Qualifying Termination     \n      means any voluntary or involuntary termination     \n      (other                                             \n      than for death, disability, or cause) after the    \n      executive has met certain specified age and/or     \n      service requirements. For most of the named        \n      executive officers, the executive must have at     \n      least 10 years of service and his or her age and   \n      years of                                           \n      service must add up to at least 60. Mr.\u00a0Montag     \n      has a special eligibility standard set forth in    \n      his applicable offer letter but has otherwise      \n      satisfied the general age and service standard.    \n      Currently, each of the named executive officers    \n      meets                                              \n      the applicable requirements for a Qualifying       \n      Termination.                                       \n                                                         \n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    71  \n                              \nExecutive compensation\n                                                         \n      Awards remain subject to performance-based         \n      cancellation prior to payment, and may be          \n      cancelled in whole or in part if losses            \n      occur. Awards also can be cancelled or recouped    \n      if the executive engages in detrimental conduct.   \n      Further, under our Incentive Compensation          \n      Recoupment Policy, the Board can require           \n      reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid   \n      to an executive                                    \n      officer whose fraud or intentional misconduct      \n      causes our company to restate its financial        \n      statements. Awards also will be subject to any     \n      policies we may adopt to implement final,          \n      released, and effective rules implementing         \n      Section\u00a0954 of the                                 \n      Dodd-Frank Act.                                    \n                                                         \nAwards to our named executive officers under the KEEP are\ngenerally designed to be paid per schedule if an\nexecutive\u0092s employment is terminated without \u0093cause\u0094 or\nfor \u0093good reason\u0094 within two years after a change in\ncontrol. This change in control treatment is often\nreferred to as \u0093double trigger\u0094 vesting, because it\nrequires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a\nsubsequent involuntary termination (either by our company\nwithout \u0093cause\u0094 or by the executive for \u0093good reason\u0094).\nThe KEEP does not provide our executive officers \u0093single\ntrigger\u0094 vesting upon a change in control. If a named\nexecutive officer is terminated for \u0093cause,\u0094 our equity-\nbased awards provide that the awards will be forfeited.\nThe following table shows the value of equity awards that\nwould have been payable, subject to the non-competeor\ncompliance with covenants, as applicable, for a\ntermination of employment as of December 31, 2020. For\nthis purpose, restricted stock units were valued at our\nclosing price as of December 31, 2020, which was $30.31\nper share. Due to a number of factors that affect the\nnature and amount of any benefits provided upon\ntermination of employment, any actual amounts paid or\ndistributed may vary from the amounts listed below.\nFactors that could affect these amounts include the time\nduring the year of any such event and the price of our\ncommon stock.

For Mr.\u00a0Montag, \u0093All other      \n       terminations except for cause\u0094 includes a          \n       resignation by him for \u0093good reason\u0094 under his      \n       2008 employment agreement, defined as a           \n       resignation following: (i)\u00a0a meaningful and       \n       detrimental alteration in the nature of the       \n       executive\u0092s responsibilities or authority; or      \n       (ii)\u00a0a material reduction in the executive\u0092s       \n       total annual compensation that is not             \n       experienced generally by similarly situated       \n       employees.                                        \n                                                         \nOther potential payments Following termination of\nemployment, our named executive officers receive payment\nof retirement benefits and nonqualified deferred\ncompensation benefits under our various plans in which\nthey participate. The value of those benefits as of\nDecember 31, 2020 is set forth in the sections above\nentitled \u0093Pension benefits table\u0094 and \u0093Nonqualified\ndeferred compensation table.\u0094 There are no special or\nenhanced benefits under those plans for our named\nexecutive officers, and all of our named executive\nofficers are fully vested in the benefits discussed in\nthose sections. We make tax and financial planning\nadvisory services available to our named executive\nofficers during their employment with us. The standard\nform of this benefit continues through the end of the\nyear in which the executive ceases employment, including\npreparation of that year\u0092s tax returns. This benefit may\ncontinue for an extended term of up to five years if the\nexecutive meets the age and service standard for a\nQualifying Termination and does not engage in any full-\ntime employment. The benefit offered during the extended\nterm will end during the calendar year any other full-\ntime employment begins; the benefit, however, will end\nimmediately following termination for cause, or if the\nexecutive engages in detrimental conduct or begins\nemployment with a named competitor.\n                         \n  72    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCEO pay ratio Bank of America employees who retire and\nmeet the applicable requirements for a Qualifying\nTermination have access to continued coverage under our\ngroup health plan, but the employee generally must pay\nfor the full cost of that coverage on an after-taxbasis\nwithout any employer subsidy. By legacy agreement, Mr.\nMontag will be able to access non-subsidizedretiree\nmedical coverage if he retires, so long as he does not\nwork for or accept another position with a competitor. An\nemployee who is a former NationsBank employee and who was\nhired before January 1, 2000 is eligible for an annual\nsupplement to help cover the cost of retiree medical\nbenefits if they meet the \u0093Rule of 75\u0094 at termination.\nThe amount of this supplement equals $30 per year of\nservice. An employee meets the Rule of 75 if they retire\nafter age 50, with at least 15 years of vesting service\nunder our pension plan, and with a combined age and years\nof service of 75 or more. As of the end of the last\nfiscal year, the only named executive officer eligible\nfor these benefits was Mr. Donofrio. The amount of the\nannual retiree medical benefit supplement for Mr.\nDonofrio based on his years of service through December\n31, 2020 is $600. If Mr. Donofrio predeceases his spouse,\nthis supplement will continue at a rate of 50% for the\nlife of his surviving spouse. Also, all eligible\nemployees hired before January 1, 2006 who meet the Rule\nof 75 when they terminate receive $5,000 of retiree life\ninsurance coverage. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Donofrio\nwas the only named executive officer who would have\nqualified for this benefit.

We then calculated our CEO\u0092s annual       \n      total compensation using the same approach to      \n      determine the pay ratio shown above.               \n                                                         \nWe invest in our employees at all levels in the company\nby rewarding performance that balances risk and reward,\nempowering professional growth and development, and by\noffering affordable benefits and programs that meet the\ndiverse needs of our employees and their families.

In selecting and approving a\nlead engagement partner, the Committee relies on relevant\nsuccession criteria established by management and the\nCommittee, interactions with prospective candidates,\nassessments of their professional experience, and input\nfrom our company\u0092s independent registered public\naccounting firm. The Committee also engages in an annual\nevaluation of the independent registered public\naccounting firm. It considers, in particular, whether the\nretention of the firm is in the best interests of our\ncompany and its shareholders, taking into account the\nfirm\u0092s quality of service, the firm\u0092s institutional\nknowledge and experience, the firm\u0092s international\ncapabilities, the firm\u0092s sufficiency of resources, the\nquality of the communication and interaction with the\nfirm, and the firm\u0092s independence, objectivity, and\nprofessional skepticism. The Committee also considers the\nadvisability and potential impact of selecting a\ndifferent independent registered public accounting firm.\nAfter assessing the qualifications, performance, and\nindependence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which\nhas served as our company\u0092s independent registered public\naccounting firm since 1958, the Committee believes that\nretaining PwC is in the best interests of our company.\nThe Committee has appointed PwC as our independent\nregistered public accounting firm to audit the 2021\nconsolidated financial statements of Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries. Although it is not\nrequired to do so, our Board is asking shareholders to\nratify PwC\u0092s appointment. If our shareholders do not\nratify PwC\u0092s appointment, the Committee will consider\nchanging our independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2022. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC\u0092s\nappointment, the Committee may appoint a different\nindependent registered public accounting firm at any time\nif it determines that such a change is appropriate. PwC\nhas advised the Committee that it is an independent\naccounting firm with respect to our company and its\naffiliates in accordance with the requirements of the SEC\nand the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nRepresentatives of PwC are expected to be present at our\nannual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a\nstatement if they choose, and are expected to be\navailable to respond to appropriate shareholder\nquestions.

Audit\nCommittee Report Our Audit Committee is composed of seven\nBoard members. Our Board has determined that all\nCommittee members are independent under the NYSE listing\nstandards, our Categorical Standards, and applicable SEC\nrules and regulations. Our Board has also determined that\nall Committee members are financially literate in\naccordance with NYSE listing standards and qualify as\n\u0093audit committee financial experts\u0094 as defined by SEC\nrules. The Committee\u0092s responsibilities are stated in a\nwritten charter adopted by our Board. Management is\nresponsible for preparing and the overall reporting\nprocess with respect to our company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements, and, with the assistance of our\ncompany\u0092s internal corporate auditors, for establishing,\nmaintaining, and assessing the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our company\u0092s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, is\nresponsible for planning and conducting an independent\naudit of our company\u0092s consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with the standards of the United States\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and for\nexpressing an opinion as to the conformity of these\nfinancial statements with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America and as to the\neffectiveness of our internal controls over financial\nreporting. The Committee\u0092s responsibility is to monitor\nand oversee these processes. The Committee annually\nevaluates PwC\u0092s qualifications, performance, and\nindependence. The Committee also oversees the performance\nof the corporate audit function managed by our Chief\nAudit Executive. The Committee has reviewed and discussed\nwith management and with PwC our company\u0092s audited\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31,\n2020, management\u0092s assessment of the effectiveness of our\ncompany\u0092s internal control over financial reporting, and\nPwC\u0092s evaluation of our company\u0092s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.

Under the plan, we\nhave reserved a number of shares of our common stock for\nissuance to employees (including executive officers) as\nequity-based awards in the form of restricted stock\nshares, restricted stock units, stock options, and SARs\nand, beginning January 1, 2019, for issuance to non-\nemployeedirectors as restricted stock awards. The KEEP is\ncurrently scheduled to expire on April 23, 2029. In March\n2021, our Board approved the amendment and restatement of\nthe KEEP to rename it the \u0093Bank of America Corporation\nEquity Plan,\u0094 or BACEP, and to make the material changes\nnoted below, subject to the approval of our shareholders\nat the annual meeting. Hereafter, the KEEP will primarily\nbe referred to as the BACEP. Material changes The\namendment and restatement makes the following three\nmaterial changes:\n                                                         \n      The number                                         \n      of shares of our common stock available for        \n      awards under the plan will be increased by 115     \n      million shares.                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      The                                                \n      amendment and restatement extends the plan term    \n      through April 19, 2031 (i.e., 10 years after the   \n      date of the annual meeting).                       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                         \nThe amendment and restatement also updates plan\nprovisions to reflect changes to Section 162(m) of the\nCode made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Impact of\nthe amendment and restatement based on information as of\nMarch 1, 2021 As of March 1, 2021, under the current\nauthorization, there are approximately 132 million shares\nof common stock available for grant as equity-based\nawards. Based on our current run rate, these shares would\nlast less than two years, while the current plan term has\neight years remaining. We believe it is appropriate to\nincrease the number of shares of our common stock\navailable for awards under the plan so that our company\ncan continue the practice of granting deferred equity-\nbased awards in lieu of cash. We estimate the total\ndilutive effect of our stock plans on our shareholders\n(sometimes called \u0093overhang\u0094) resulting from the\namendment and restatement would be approximately 5.0%,\nwith the incremental overhang resulting from the\nrequested share increase equal to approximately 1.2%. The\noverhang is calculated as follows, in each case as of\nMarch 1, 2021:\n                                                         \n  (a) Incremental share request                          \n  subject to                                115,000,000  \n  shareholder approval                                   \n  (b) Shares underlying outstanding                      \n  awards of restricted shares /             204,518,373  \n  stock-settled restricted stock units                   \n  under all equity plans(1)                              \n  (c) Options outstanding under all                   0  \n  equity plans(2)                                        \n  (d) Shares currently available for                     \n  future issuance under all equity          131,938,573  \n  plans(3)                                               \n  (e) Total shares available for, or                     \n  outstanding under, equity awards (a       451,456,946  \n  + b + c + d)                                           \n  (f) Total common shares outstanding     8,627,252,552  \n  (g) Fully diluted overhang                       5.0%  \n  (e/(e+f))(4)                                           \n  (h) Basic diluted overhang (e/f)                 5.2%  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       Includes 5,736,404 vested restricted stock units  \n       subject to a required six- or                     \n       twelve-month holding period and 3,221,225 vested  \n       restricted stock units that are expected to be    \n       issued/delivered within 30 days of the record     \n  (1)  date.

Additionally, our rate at which we grant equity\nawards relative to shares of our common stock outstanding\n(sometimes referred to as \u0093run rate\u0094) was below the\naverage run rate for our primary competitor group on a\none-yearand three-year average basis. For the past three\ncalendar years (2018-2020), the weighted average annual\nshare usage is less than 1% of our common shares\noutstanding. If the proposed amendment and restatement is\napproved, we expect the pool of requested shares to last\napproximately two to three years assuming we maintain\nsimilar grant practices as over the past two years and\nassuming hypothetically our current stock price remains\nconstant. The number of shares remaining available for\ngrant under our equity compensation plans as noted in the\nprevious table differs from those reported as of December\n31, 2020 because that information does not take into\naccount year-to-dategrants during 2021 for the 2020\nperformance year. Information regarding the number of\nshares remaining available for grant as required by SEC\ndisclosure rules are discussed in detail in this proposal\nunder \u0093Additional Information\u0094 on page 82. The list of\ncompanies included in our primary competitor group are\ndetailed under \u0093Competitor groups\u0094 on page 61. Purpose of\nthe plan The plan, and the proposed amendment and\nrestatement of it, is intended to serve a critical role\nin our pay-for-performancecompensation program and is\nnecessary for us to comply with the regulatory landscape\nin certain jurisdictions. In addition, our Board believes\nthat equity-based awards aid in our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate our employees and are the most direct\nway to align employee interests with those of\nshareholders. As part of our pay-for-\nperformancepractices, more than 96,000 employees receive\nvariable incentives. More highly compensated employees\nreceive a portion of their variable incentive as deferred\nrestricted stock units (RSUs). The portion of the\nvariable incentive deferred as equity-based awards\ngenerally increases with compensation levels according to\na predetermined deferral grid, aligning employees\u0092\ninterests with those of shareholders. RSUs are also a\nsignificant component of the Delivering Together special\ncash and stock awards that will be made to 97% of\nemployees in Q1 2021. These awards continue to expand the\nnumber of employees receiving stock awards, driving\nincreased employee stock ownership and alignment with\nshareholder interests. The RSU awards are a key part of\nour pay-for-performancephilosophy, and in many cases are\nrequired by law, rule, and regulation. In addition, our\nexecutive officers receive PRSUs that must be re-earnedby\nmeeting specific performance criteria, as described on\npage 60 for awards granted in February 2021. Equity\nawards granted to employees are subject to cancellation\nand clawback features which encourage appropriate\nbehavior and manage risk in our compensation program;\nthese features are described on page 55. The value of\nRSUs tracks the price of our common shares. Compensation\nexpense is in the personnel expense line of the income\nstatement. The plan, and the proposed amendment and\nrestatement of it, is intended to be the company\u0092s\nvehicle for delivering deferred equity-based awards.\nSince additional shares to the plan were last approved by\nshareholders in 2019, the amount of common stock awarded\nhas averaged approximately 90 million shares each year;\nwe now have approximately 132 million shares remaining\nfor awards. The Board has determined to increase the\nshares of our common stock available for awards under the\nplan by 115 million shares to enable the granting of plan\nawards in the future. The alternative would be to\nincrease the use of deferred cash awards, which we\nbelieve would be less aligned with shareholder interests.\nTherefore, the Board recommends the amendment and\nrestatement to increase the number of shares of common\nstock available for awards under the plan. In addition,\nfor the last three years, the company has repurchased\nshares of common stock, in an amount equal to the value\nof stock-settled equity awards as they are recognized\ninto capital. These share repurchases offset the net new\nshares of common stock delivered under the plan. The\ncompany currently intends to continue this repurchase\npractice.

A copy\nof the BACEP, approved by the Board in March 2021, is\nattached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. The\nproposed amendment and restatement will become effective\nonly if the BACEP is approved by our shareholders. Number\nof shares The BACEP, as approved by shareholders in 2015,\nprovides that the aggregate number of shares of our\ncommon stock available for grants of awards under the\nplan from and after January 1, 2015 will not exceed the\nsum of (i) 450 million shares plus (ii) any shares that\nwere subject to an award as of December 31, 2014 under\nthe BACEP, if such award is cancelled, terminates,\nexpires, lapses or is settled in cash for any reason from\nand after January 1, 2015 plus (iii) effective upon April\n24, 2019, 150 million shares. As of March 1, 2021 there\nwere approximately 132 million common shares available\nfor future awards under the BACEP. The amendment and\nrestatement, if approved by shareholders, would increase\nthe number of shares available for awards by 115 million\nshares, to approximately 247 million shares estimated\nbased on information available on March 1, 2021.\n                         \n  78    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 4: Amending and restating the Bank of America\nCorporation Key Employee Equity Plan Under the BACEP,\neach award, whether granted as a stock option, SAR,\nrestricted stock share or restricted stock unit, counts\nagainst the available share pool as one share for each\nshare awarded. The share re-useprovisions under the BACEP\ndo not include any \u0093liberal share counting\u0094 features.\nShares used to cover the exercise price of stock options\nor to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection\nwith awards will continue to be unavailable for awards\nunder the BACEP. In addition, the total number of shares\ncovering stock-settled SARs or net-settledoptions will be\ncounted against the pool of available shares, not just\nthe net shares issued upon exercise. Shares covered by\nawards will continue to be available for awards if and\nonly to the extent (a) the award is cancelled or\nforfeited or (b) the award is settled in cash.\nAdministration The Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee will administer the BACEP. To the extent\npermitted by law, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee may designate an individual or committee (which\nneed not consist of directors) to act as the appropriate\ncommittee under the BACEP for granting awards to\nemployees who are not \u0093officers\u0094 under Section 16 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act. Under the BACEP, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee has authority\nwith respect to the following:\n                                                         \n      the                                                \n      selection of the employees to receive awards from  \n      time to time                                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the granting of awards in amounts as it            \n      determines                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the imposition of limitations, restrictions and    \n      conditions upon                                    \n      awards                                             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the                                                \n      certification of the attainment of performance     \n      goals, if applicable                               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the interpretation of the BACEP and the adoption,  \n      amendment and                                      \n      rescission of administrative guidelines and other  \n      rules and regulations relating to the BACEP        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the correction of any defect or omission or        \n      reconciliation of any                              \n      inconsistency in the BACEP or any award granted    \n      under the BACEP                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the making of all other determinations and taking  \n      of all other                                       \n      actions necessary or advisable for the             \n      implementation and administration of the BACEP     \n                                                         \nThe Board will continue to administer grants of\nrestricted stock under the BACEP to non-\nemployeedirectors. Eligibility Except for certain non-\nemployeedirector restricted stock awards as described\nbelow, employees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries\nmay participate in the BACEP, as selected by the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee. Eligible\nemployees are those employees of Bank of America and its\nsubsidiaries who have made, or are expected to make,\nimportant contributions to our business, as determined by\nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee, including\npersons employed outside the United States. Approximately\n95,000 employees are expected to be eligible to\nparticipate. However, as mentioned above, the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee in its\ndiscretion selects which employees will receive any\nawards. The BACEP also provides for awards of restricted\nstock to non-employeedirectors as part of our director\ncompensation program. All 15 of the non-employeedirectors\nnominated for election at the annual meeting are eligible\nto receive these restricted stock awards. As noted\nelsewhere in this proxy statement, as part of our\ndirector compensation program, our Board grants\nrestricted stock to directors on the day of their\nelection or appointment as a director. Any director\nnominee that receives at least a majority of votes cast\nat the annual meeting will be elected at the annual\nmeeting, and will be eligible to receive the restricted\nstock award as part of their 2021-2022 director\ncompensation. In the event this proposed amendment and\nrestatement does not receive at least a majority of the\nvotes cast at the annual meeting, and the amendment and\nrestatement does not become effective, there are enough\ncommon shares remaining for issuance to grant directors\nelected at the annual meeting the 2021-2022 restricted\nstock award. Types of awards The BACEP permits awards of\nstock options, SARs, restricted stock shares and\nrestricted stock units to employees and restricted stock\nshares to non-employeedirectors, all of which are\ndescribed in more detail below. Awards of stock options\nand SARs .The BACEP provides for the grant of options to\npurchase shares of our common stock at option prices\nwhich are not less than the fair market value of a share\nof our common stock at the close of business on the date\nof grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common\nstock as of March 1, 2021, was $35.79.) The BACEP also\nprovides for the grant of SARs to employees. SARs entitle\nthe holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares\nof our common stock or a combination of the two, as the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee in its\ndiscretion may determine, with a value equal to the\ndifference between: (i) the fair market value on the\nexercise date of the shares with respect to which a SAR\nis exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Awards of options under the\nBACEP, which may be either incentive stock options (which\nqualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock\noptions, are determined by the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee. No more than an aggregate of 450\nmillion shares may be awarded as incentive stock options\nunder the BACEP. The terms and conditions of each option\nand SAR are to be determined by the Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee (or its designees) at the time of\ngrant.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    79  \n                              \nProposal 4: Amending and restating the Bank of America\nCorporation Key Employee Equity Plan Options and SARs\ngranted under the BACEP will expire not more than 10\nyears from the date of grant, and the award agreements\nentered into with each participant will specify the\nextent to which options and SARs may be exercised during\ntheir respective terms, including in the event of the\nparticipant\u0092s death, disability or termination of\nemployment. The BACEP includes two additional limitations\non stock option and SAR grants.\n                                                         \n      The BACEP                                          \n      expressly prohibits dividend equivalents with      \n      respect to stock options and SARs.                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      The BACEP                                          \n      permits nonqualified stock options and SARs to be  \n      transferable if and to the extent permitted under  \n      the applicable award agreement, but prohibits      \n      transfers to be made for consideration.            \n                                                         \nOur Board has not granted stock options or SARs since\n2008. Awards of restricted stock shares and restricted\nstock units .Under the BACEP, the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee may award employees restricted shares\nof our common stock or restricted stock units which\nrepresent the right to receive shares of our common stock\n(or cash equal to the fair market value of those shares).\nEach award agreement will contain the terms of the award,\nincluding any applicable conditions, which may include\ncontinued service of the participant, the attainment of\nspecified performance goals or any other conditions\ndeemed appropriate by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee. Restricted stock shares will be held in our\ncustody until the applicable restrictions have been\nsatisfied. The participant cannot sell, transfer, pledge,\nassign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate restricted\nstock shares until the applicable restrictions are\nsatisfied. Once the restrictions are satisfied, the\nshares will be delivered to the participant\u0092s account,\nfree of restrictions. During the period of restriction,\nthe participant may exercise full voting rights with\nrespect to the restricted stock shares. The participant\nwill also be credited with dividends with respect to\nrestricted stock shares. Dividends may be payable\ncurrently or subject to additional restrictions as\ndetermined by the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and reflected in the award agreement. Our grant\npractice has been not to pay dividends on restricted\nstock shares during the vesting period, but to accrue\nthose dividends with interest from the grant date to be\npaid only if and when the underlying award becomes\nvested. The award agreement for any restricted stock\nunits will specify whether units that become earned and\npayable will be settled in shares of our common stock\n(with one share of common stock to be delivered for each\nearned and payable restricted stock unit), in cash (equal\nto the aggregate fair market value of the restricted\nstock units that are earned and payable), or in a\ncombination of shares and cash. Shares of our common\nstock used to pay earned restricted stock units may have\nadditional restrictions, as determined by the\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee. Unpaid\nrestricted stock units may have dividend equivalent\nrights, as determined by the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee and evidenced in the award agreement.\nAs with restricted stock shares, our grant practice has\nbeen to include dividend equivalent rights for awards of\nrestricted stock units that accrue with interest from the\ngrant date and are paid only if and when the underlying\naward becomes vested. Unpaid restricted stock units have\nno voting rights. The BACEP also provides for awards of\nrestricted stock to our non-employeedirectors as part of\nour director compensation program. These awards vest one\nyear after the date of grant or, if earlier, at the date\nof the next annual meeting. However, awards that are\nscheduled to vest in less than 50 weeks after the date of\ngrant will count against the 5% exception pool for the\nminimum vesting requirements described below. The awards\nvest earlier in case of death or a change in control. If\na director retires before the one-yearvesting date, a\nprorated amount of the award vests based on the number of\ndays the director served during the vesting period before\nretirement. Awards may be deferred under the Bank of\nAmerica Corporation Director Deferral Plan. See \u0093Director\ncompensation\u0094 on page 45 for additional details about our\ndirector compensation program. Minimum vesting conditions\nThe BACEP provides that generally all stock-settled\nawards will vest no more quickly than ratably annually as\nof each anniversary over a three-year period beginning on\nthe grant date of the award. This requirement does not\napply to (1) certain substitute awards arising from\nacquisitions, (2) shares delivered in lieu of fully\nvested cash incentive awards, (3) awards to non-\nemployeedirectors that vest on the earlier of the one\nyear anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual\nmeeting of shareholders (but not sooner than 50 weeks\nafter the grant date) or (4) awards that vest based on\nthe achievement of performance goals over a period of at\nleast one year. Also, the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee may grant equity-based awards without regard to\nthe minimum vesting requirement with respect to a maximum\nof 5% of the available share reserve authorized for\nissuance under the BACEP. In addition, the minimum\nvesting requirement does not apply to the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee\u0092s discretion to provide for\naccelerated exercisability or vesting of any award,\nincluding in cases of retirement, workforce reduction,\ndeath, disability, or a change in control, in the terms\nof the award or otherwise. Section 162(m) award limits\nPrior to 2018, awards under the BACEP could be designed\nto qualify as \u0093performance-based compensation\u0094 that were\nintended to be exempt from the deduction limits under\nSection 162(m) of the Code. Changes in the U.S. tax laws\nmade by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated this\nexception for grants made from and after January 1, 2018.\nUnder the pre-2018Section 162(m) rules, the plan under\nwhich awards were granted had to include certain\nshareholder-approved individual award limits in order for\nawards to qualify as performance-based compensation. The\nBACEP included such individual award limits, which were\nlimited to options/SARs and performance-based restricted\nstock and RSU awards that were intended to qualify for\nthe Section 162(m) performance-based compensation\nexception. Although no longer required, the amendment and\nrestatement continues to include award limits, by which a\nparticipant may not be granted in any calendar year: (i)\nstock options or SARs for more than 4,000,000 shares, or\n(ii) performance-based restricted stock shares/units for\nmore than 4,000,000 shares (assuming maximum\nperformance).\n                         \n  80    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 4: Amending and restating the Bank of America\nCorporation Key Employee Equity Plan Withholding for\npayment of taxes The BACEP provides for the withholding\nand payment by a participant of any payroll or\nwithholding taxes required by applicable law. The BACEP\npermits a participant to satisfy this requirement, with\nthe approval of the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee and subject to the terms of the BACEP, by\nwithholding from the participant a number of shares of\nour common stock otherwise issuable under the award\nhaving a fair market value equal to the amount of\napplicable payroll and withholding taxes. It also permits\nthe company and the participant to withhold at rates up\nto the maximum statutory tax rates. Adjustments for\nchanges in capitalization In the event of any change in\nthe number of our outstanding shares of common stock by\nreason of any stock dividend, split, spin-\noff,recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination,\nexchange of shares or otherwise, the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock with respect to which awards\nmay be made under the BACEP, the annual limit on\nindividual awards, the limits on incentive stock options,\nrestricted stock and restricted stock units and the\nterms, types of shares and number of shares of any\noutstanding awards under the BACEP will be equitably\nadjusted by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nin its discretion to preserve the benefit of the award\nfor us and the participant. No single trigger vesting\nupon a change in control for employees The BACEP permits\nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee to provide\nfor vesting of awards to employees in connection with a\nchange in control of Bank of America if there is also a\ntermination of employment in connection with the change\nin control. This is often referred to as \u0093double trigger\u0094\nvesting. For these purposes, a termination is considered\nto be in connection with a change of control if it occurs\nupon or within two years after the change in control and\nis for one of the following two reasons: (i) an\ninvoluntary termination by the company without \u0093cause\u0094 or\n(ii) a termination by the participant for \u0093good reason.\u0094\n\u0093Cause\u0094 and \u0093good reason\u0094 will be as defined in the\napplicable award agreements. In addition, the Committee\nmay provide for the assumption or substitution of awards\nby a surviving corporation. Awards to non-\nemployeedirectors fully vest upon a change in control.\nAmendment and termination of the plan Our Board has the\npower to amend, modify or terminate the BACEP on a\nprospective basis, provided that no termination,\namendment or modification shall adversely affect in any\nmaterial way any award previously granted under the plan\nwithout the written consent of any affected participant.\nStockholder approval will be obtained for any change to\nthe material terms of the BACEP to the extent required by\nNew York Stock Exchange listing requirements or other\napplicable law. The BACEP, as amended, automatically\nterminates at the close of business on April 19, 2031\nfollowing which no awards may be made under the BACEP.\nOption and SARs repricing prohibited The BACEP\nspecifically prohibits the repricing of stock options or\nSARs without shareholder approval. For this purpose, a\n\u0093repricing\u0094 means any of the following (or any other\naction that has the same effect as any of the following):\n(A) changing the terms of a stock option or SAR to lower\nits exercise price; (B) any other action that is treated\nas a \u0093repricing\u0094 under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; and (C) repurchasing for cash or canceling a\nstock option or SAR at a time when its exercise price is\ngreater than the fair market value of the underlying\nstock in exchange for another award, unless the\ncancellation and exchange occurs in connection with\nchange in capitalization or similar change. Such\ncancellation and exchange would be considered a\n\u0093repricing\u0094 regardless of whether it is treated as a\n\u0093repricing\u0094 under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples and regardless of whether it is voluntary on\nthe part of the employee. Federal income tax treatment\nThe following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of awards under the BACEP based\non the law as in effect on the date of this document. The\nfollowing discussion does not purport to cover federal\nemployment taxes or other federal tax consequences that\nmay be employed with awards, nor does it cover state,\nlocal or non-U.S.taxes. Nonqualified stock options . A\nparticipant generally will not recognize taxable income\nupon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option\nwith an exercise price at least equal to the fair market\nvalue of our common stock on the date of grant and no\nadditional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a\nnonqualified stock option, a participant generally will\nrecognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an\namount equal to the difference between the fair market\nvalue of the shares underlying the stock option on the\ndate of exercise and the exercise price of the stock\noption. When a participant sells the shares, the\nparticipant will have short-term or long-term capital\ngain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference\nbetween the amount the participant received from the sale\nand the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax basis of\nthe shares generally will be equal to the fair market\nvalue of the shares on the exercise date. Incentive stock\noptions . A participant generally will not recognize\ntaxable income upon the grant of an incentive stock\noption. If a participant exercises an incentive stock\noption during employment or within three months after\nemployment ends (12 months in the case of permanent and\ntotal disability), the participant will not recognize\ntaxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (although the participant\ngenerally will have taxable income for alternative\nminimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option\nwere a nonqualified stock option). If a participant sells\nor otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon\nexercise of an incentive stock option after the later of\n(a) one year from the date the participant exercised the\noption and (b) two years from the grant date of the stock\noption, the participant generally will recognize long-\nterm capital gain or loss equal to the difference between\nthe amount the participant received in the disposition\nand the exercise price of the stock option. If a\nparticipant sells or otherwise disposes of shares\nacquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option\nbefore these\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    81  \n                              \nProposal 4: Amending and restating the Bank of America\nCorporation Key Employee Equity Plan holding period\nrequirements are satisfied, the disposition will\nconstitute a \u0093disqualifying disposition,\u0094 and the\nparticipant generally will recognize taxable ordinary\nincome in the year of disposition equal to the excess of\nthe fair market value of the shares on the date of\nexercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or,\nif less, the excess of the amount realized on the\ndisposition of the shares over the exercise price of the\nstock option). The balance of the participant\u0092s gain on a\ndisqualifying disposition, if any, will be taxed as\nshort-term or long-term capital gain, as the case may be.\nWith respect to both nonqualified stock options and\nincentive stock options, special rules apply if a\nparticipant uses shares of common stock already held by\nthe participant to pay the exercise price or if the\nshares received upon exercise of the stock option are\nsubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the\nparticipant. Stock appreciation rights . A participant\ngenerally will not recognize taxable income upon the\ngrant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at least\nequal to the fair market value of our common stock on the\ndate of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon\nthe exercise of a SAR, a participant generally will\nrecognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an\namount equal to the difference between the fair market\nvalue of the shares underlying the SAR on the date of\nexercise and the grant price of the SAR. Restricted stock\nshares and restricted stock units . A participant\ngenerally will not have taxable income upon the grant of\nrestricted stock or restricted stock units. Instead, the\nparticipant will recognize ordinary income at the time of\nvesting or payout equal to the fair market value (on the\nvesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received\nminus any amount paid. For restricted stock only, a\nparticipant may instead elect to be taxed at the time of\ngrant. Tax consequences to Bank of America . In the\nforegoing cases, we generally will be entitled to a\ndeduction at the same time, and in the same amount, as a\nparticipant recognizes ordinary income, subject to\ncertain limitations imposed under the Code, including\nthose imposed by Section 162(m) as applicable. New stock\nplan benefits Because awards under the BACEP are\ndiscretionary, awards are generally not determinable at\nthis time. As stated previously, in the event the\nproposed amendment and restatement is not approved by\nshareholders at the annual meeting, there are enough\nshares remaining under the plan for the Board to grant\nrestricted stock awards to directors elected at the\nannual meeting as part of 2021-2022 director\ncompensation.

We encourage\nthis dialogue and believe this engagement is beneficial\nto our company and Board. Of the four shareholder\nproposals set forth below, none of the proponents\nattempted to engage with our company prior to submitting\ntheir proposal. We sought to engage with the proponents\nafter we received their proposals; we met with Mr.\nHarrington\u0092s representative and with CtW Investment Group\nabout their respective proposals, and Messrs. Chevedden\nand Steiner declined our invitation to discuss their\nproposals. We acknowledge the rights of shareholders to\nsubmit proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement in\naccordance with SEC rules. We also encourage shareholders\nthat have questions or would like additional information\nabout our practices or policies, or that are\ncontemplating submitting a proposal for inclusion in our\nproxy statement, to contact us beforehand to allow for a\nconstructive discussion of their concerns. See\n\u0093Shareholder proposals for our 2022 annual meeting\u0094 on\npage 93. Proposal 5: lmprove our catch-22proxy access\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No 205, Redondo Beach,\nCA 90278, has advised us that he intends to present the\nfollowing resolution: Shareholders request that our board\nof directors take the steps necessary to enable as many\nshareholders as may be needed to aggregate their shares\nto equal 3% of our stock owned continuously for 3-yearsin\norder to enable shareholder proxy access. The current\narbitrary ration of 20 shareholders to initiate\nshareholder proxy access can be called Catch-22Proxy\nAccess. In order to assemble a group of 20 shareholders,\nwho have owned 3% of the stock for an unbroken\n3-years,one would reasonably need to start with about 60\nactivist shareholders who own 9% of BAC stock for an\nunbroken 3-yearsbecause initiating proxy access is a\ncomplicated process that is easily susceptible to errors\nand dropouts. The 60 activist shareholders could then be\nwhittled down to 40 shareholders because some\nshareholders would be unable to timely meet all the paper\nchase requirements. After the 40 shareholders submit\ntheir paperwork to management \u0096 then management might\narbitrarily claim that 10 shareholders do not meet the\nrequirements figuring that shareholders do not want a\ncourt battle and management might convince another 10\nshareholders to drop out \u0096 leaving 20 shareholders. But\nthe current rule does not allow 40 shareholders to submit\ntheir paperwork to management to end up with 20 qualified\nshareholders. And 60 shareholders who own 9% of company\nfor an unbroken 3-yearsmight determine that they own 51%\nof company stock when length of unbroken stock ownership\nis factored out. Plus it would be easier to simply call\nfor a special shareholder meeting because 10% of shares\ncan call for a special meeting and there is no\n3-yearunbroken stock ownership disqualifier. But how does\none begin to assemble a group of 60 potential\nparticipants if potential participants cannot even be\nguaranteed participant status after following the tedious\nrules that can easily be 1500-words of legalese. A single\nshareholder always takes the risk that one will be the\n21st shareholder that could be voted off the island after\na substantial investment of time by the arbitrary ration\nof 20 shareholders. Who would be voted off the island?\nWould one favor shareholders who own the most stock or\nshareholders who have the best access to expert proxy\naccess advice or shareholders who could attract the best\nproxy access candidates or shareholders who can attract\nthe most votes to the proxy access candidates? For any\ngroup of shareholders who have the horsepower to initiate\nthe current Catch-22proxy access, calling a special\nshareholder meeting is a more rational option. Without\nthis reform our current Catch-22proxy access is excess\nbaggage. Please vote yes: Improve our catch-22proxy\naccess \u0096 Proposal 5 Our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094\nProposal 5 because:\n                                                         \n      Our                                                \n      existing proxy access Bylaw strikes the            \n      appropriate balance between promoting shareholder  \n      rights and protecting the interests of all of our  \n      shareholders;                                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Our                                                \n      Bylaw\u0092s limit on the size of a proxy access         \n      nominating group is in line with market practice,  \n      with the vast majority of companies that allow     \n      proxy access having imposed the same or a more     \n      restrictive limit; and                             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      We have                                            \n      strong corporate governance policies and           \n      procedures that empower our shareholders and       \n      enable shareholders to provide ongoing feedback    \n      to our Board.                                      \n                                                         \nThe proposal requests that the Board amend our proxy\naccess Bylaw to eliminate the limit on the number of\nshareholders that can aggregate their common stock\nownership to meet our minimum stock ownership threshold.\nBecause our proxy access Bylaw already provides our\nshareholders with a meaningful role in the nomination and\nelection of directors, and aligns with current market\npractice, and in light of our long-standing commitment to\nstrong corporate governance and shareholder engagement,\nwe believe the changes requested by the proposal are\nunnecessary and contrary to our shareholders\u0092 interests.\nMoreover, we note that in each of the past two years, the\nproponent has submitted a proposal requesting changes to\nour proxy access right and each year shareholders have\nresoundingly rejected the requested changes.\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    83  \n                              \nProposals 5-8: Shareholder proposals Our existing proxy\naccess Bylaw strikes the appropriate balance between\npromoting shareholder rights and protecting the interests\nof all of our shareholders.In March 2015, our company was\nthe first major financial institution, and one of the\nfirst large U.S. public companies, to amend our Bylaws to\nadopt a proxy access provision. This Bylaw provision\nallows one or more shareholders to nominate director\ncandidates for election to our Board, and for those\ndirector candidates to be included in our proxy\nmaterials. Under our proxy access Bylaw, a group of up to\n20 shareholders that collectively has owned at least 3%\nof our common stock for at least three years may form a\nnominating group and nominate director nominees\nconstituting up to 20% of our Board, and include those\nnominees in our proxy materials. Our Board evaluated a\nnumber of different factors and potential formulations in\nadopting our proxy access Bylaw, and considered the right\nof shareholders to have meaningful participation in the\ndirector election process, as well as the importance of\ninstituting reasonable terms and informational and\nprocedural requirements, such as limiting the number of\nshareholders that may aggregate their share ownership to\nachieve the 3% nominating group threshold. Based on its\nassessment of these factors, our Board concluded that our\ncurrent form of proxy access Bylaw appropriately balances\nshareholder rights to use proxy access with the best\ninterests of all our shareholders. Of relevance to this\nproposal, the Bylaw provides shareholders the ability to\nnominate a director candidate in our proxy statement and\npermits up to 20 shareholders to aggregate their holdings\nto satisfy our 3% ownership threshold for using proxy\naccess. The Bylaw thereby permits shareholders holding a\nrange of ownership positions in our company to\ncollectively nominate director nominees and include their\nnominees in our proxy statement, while avoiding a\nsituation where shareholders burden the company and our\nshareholders with candidates who are not able to obtain a\nthreshold level of support. Our Board determined that the\n20 shareholder limit is the most appropriate aggregation\nlimit because it balances our administrative interests\nand costs, while also providing a meaningful proxy access\nBylaw that is broadly accessible to our shareholders. In\nlight of the feedback we have received from our\nshareholders since 2015, and our ongoing review of the\nproxy access rights adopted by other companies, we\ncontinue to believe that our existing proxy access Bylaw\nis most appropriate for the company and our shareholders.\nOur Bylaw\u0092s limit on the size of a proxy access\nnominating group is in line with market practice, with\nthe vast majority of companies that allow proxy access\nhaving imposed the same or a more restrictive limit.The\nlimit on the size of the nominating group as described\nabove is designed to control the administrative burden of\nconfirming and monitoring share ownership within a\nnominating group and prevent the abuse of proxy access by\na group that includes shareholders that do not have a\nsubstantial economic stake in the company or who may have\nspecial or short-term interests and who are not able to\ngain a threshold level of support. We note that our\n20-shareholder limit is equal to or lower than the limit\nadopted at the vast majority of companies that have proxy\naccess bylaws. Of the 644 companies that have adopted\nproxy access since 2015, 629 companies (over 97%) have\nadopted a limit on the size of the nominating group, and\nour 20-shareholder limit is the same or more permissive\nthan the limit adopted at 96% of companies with proxy\naccess provisions. Under the current threshold, our\nshareholders already have the meaningful ability to\naggregate their ownership and participate in the director\nnomination and election process. We have strong corporate\ngovernance policies and procedures that empower our\nshareholders and enable them to provide ongoing feedback\nto our Board. Our proxy access Bylaw is only one of many\nprovisions that help advance and protect the interests of\nour shareholders and provide them a meaningful ability to\nmake their views known to the Board. In addition to the\nproxy access Bylaw, one or more shareholders owning 10%\nor more of our outstanding voting stock are entitled to\ncall a special meeting of shareholders. The ability for\n10% of our shareholders to call a special meeting\nrepresents a significant shareholder right\u0097and one that\nis significantly more shareholder-friendly than the right\nat most S&P 500 companies. Of the 314 S&P 500 companies\nthat permit shareholders to call a special meeting, more\nthan 84% of those companies have a stock ownership\nthreshold greater than 10%, with the most prevalent stock\nownership threshold set at 25%, and no companies have a\nthreshold lower than our 10% threshold. Our Board and\nmanagement are committed to engaging with and listening\nto our shareholders on an ongoing basis. At least twice\nannually, management invites our 250 largest\ninstitutional investors and a number of other active\ninstitutional investors, representing more than 61% of\nour outstanding shares, to engage with us. As described\nin \u0093Shareholder engagement\u0094 on page 30 of this proxy\nstatement, in 2020-21management and our Board\u0092s Lead\nIndependent Director held 43 meetings with shareholders\nrepresenting approximately 2.1 billion shares of our\noutstanding common stock. At these meetings, we solicit\nour shareholders\u0092 input on important performance,\ngovernance, executive compensation, human capital\nmanagement, regulatory, environmental, social, and other\nmatters. We maintain a two-waydialogue to clarify and\ndeepen our Board\u0092s understanding of shareholder concerns,\nand provide shareholders with insight into our Board\u0092s\nprocesses. Moreover, input received from our shareholders\nand other stakeholders as part of our year-round\nengagement program has resulted in a number of\nenhancements in our corporate governance, ESG, and\nexecutive compensation policies. For example, on page 32\nof this proxy statement we report on actions we have\ntaken as a result of our extensive shareholder engagement\nactivities. Other robust corporate governance policies\nthat we have adopted to empower our shareholders include\nthe annual election of all directors, majority voting for\ndirector elections, and independent Board leadership by a\nstrong Lead Independent Director. Our Board is committed\nto ongoing director succession planning reviews to\nprovide for the Board\u0092s regular renewal and refreshment\nin alignment with our long-term strategy, as described in\n\u0093Identifying and evaluating director candidates\u0094 on page\n3 of this proxy statement.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 5).                       \n                                                    \n                         \n  84    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 5-8: Shareholder proposals Proposal 6:\nShareholder right to act by written consent Kenneth\nSteiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, has\nadvised us that he intends to present the following\nresolution: Shareholders request that our board of\ndirectors take such steps as may be necessary to permit\nwritten consent by shareholders entitled to cast the\nminimum number of votes that would be necessary to\nauthorize the action at a meeting at which all\nshareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and\nvoting. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any\nappropriate topic for written consent. This proposal\ntopic won 95%-support at a Dover Corporation shareholder\nmeeting and 88%-support at an AT&T shareholder meeting.\nTaking action by written consent in place of a meeting is\na means shareholders can use to raise important matters\noutside the normal annual meeting cycle like the election\nof a new director. For instance a new director could be\nelected to replace directors who receive substantial\nnegative votes. In 2020 Maria Zuber received 407 million\nnegative votes. According to the argument in the 2020 BAC\nproxy management should be in favor of this proposal.\nManagement said that given a choice shareholders are\nbetter served by calling for a special meeting than by\nacting by written consent. If this is really the case\nthen management should be in favor of giving shareholders\nthe right to act by written consent because shareholders\ncould then chose the supposedly less effective means of\nwritten consent to send a wakeup call to management and\nmanagement could thus have an easier path to victory over\nshareholders. In any event a major advantage of special\nshareholder meetings has been completely blown out of the\nwater since the publication of the 2020 BAC annual\nmeeting proxy. A cornerstone of the 2020 BAC argument\nwas, \u0093A special meeting permits shareholders, the Board,\nand company management to discuss applicable shareholder\nconcerns.\u0094 To the contrary with the near universal use of\ntightly controlled online shareholder meetings, which can\nbe only 10-minutesof stilted formalities, shareholders\ncan be severely restricted in engaging with management\nand making their views known because all challenging\nquestions and comments directed to management can be\nscreened out. For instance Goodyear management hit the\nmute button right in the middle of a formal shareholder\nproposal presentation at its 2020 shareholder meeting to\nbar constructive criticism. Plus AT&T management would\nnot even allow the proponents of shareholder proposals to\nread their proposals by telephone at the 2020 AT&T online\nannual meeting during the pandemic.

Now more than ever shareholders need to\nhave the option to take action outside of a shareholder\nmeeting since tightly controlled online shareholder\nmeetings are a shareholder engagement wasteland.

We are committed to effective corporate\ngovernance policies and practices that promote the long-\nterm interests of all shareholders. This marks the third\nyear in a row that the proponent has submitted a proposal\non this topic for consideration by our shareholders, and\nin each of the past two years shareholders have\nresoundingly rejected the proposal\u0092s request. As\ndescribed below, our Board continues to believe that the\nchange requested by the proposal could be unfair and\ndisenfranchising to shareholders, is unnecessary in light\nof our current governance practices and policies, and is\nmore onerous to use than rights already available to our\nshareholders. We believe that matters requiring\nshareholder approval should be presented to, and voted\non, by all shareholders.Unlike matters presented for vote\nat a shareholder meeting, shareholder action by written\nconsent may not require communication to all\nshareholders, and may deny shareholders the ability to\nparticipate in major decisions affecting the company and\ntheir interests. A shareholder seeking action by written\n                              \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    85  \n                              \nProposals 5-8: Shareholder proposals consent may attempt\nto solicit the fewest possible shareholders to take\naction, rather than seeking input from all shareholders,\nand may rely on consents obtained from some shareholders\nbefore other shareholders have had the ability to\nevaluate a proposal, express their views, and vote.\nAction by written consent thereby can disenfranchise\nshareholders who are not given the opportunity to vote.\nIn contrast, when shareholders can act at a special or\nannual meeting of shareholders, all shareholders receive\nadvance notice of the meeting and have clearly\nestablished times during which they can evaluate the\nissues, engage with the company and other shareholders,\ncommunicate their views, and vote. Moreover, permitting\nshareholder action by written consent could create\nconfusion and disruption, as multiple shareholders could\nsolicit written consents at any time on a wide range of\nissues, which may duplicate or conflict with other\nproposals. While the proponent has criticized virtual\nshareholder meetings as undermining the benefits of\nacting through a shareholder meeting, the proponent fails\nto consider most of the procedural benefits leading up to\na meeting that we describe above, which may not be\navailable when shareholders seek to act by written\nconsent. In addition, at our 2021 annual meeting that\nwill be held virtually, shareholders will have an\nopportunity to participate in question and answer\nsessions regarding the management and shareholder\nproposals contained in this proxy statement, as well as\nother relevant topics of concern to shareholders. This\nopportunity to engage with the company and hear views of\nother shareholders would not be available when\nshareholders seek to act by written consent. Shareholders\nowning 10% of our common shares already have the\nmeaningful ability to call a special meeting of\nshareholders outside of the annual meeting cycle, and\nshareholders owning 3% of our common shares already have\nthe ability to nominate a candidate for election to our\nBoard through our proxy access Bylaw provision. In\naddition to shareholders being able to propose and vote\non important matters at our annual meeting, one or more\nshareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting\nstock are entitled to call a special meeting of\nshareholders. Shareholders\u0092 ability to use the special\nmeeting process is not subject to any conditions beyond\nthose that also apply to a management-called special\nmeeting. A special meeting permits shareholders, the\nBoard, and company management to discuss applicable\nshareholder concerns. Unlike action by written consent, a\nspecial meeting of shareholders empowers all shareholders\nto participate collectively in a single meeting and make\nan informed vote. The ability for 10% of our shareholders\nto call a special meeting represents a significant\nright\u0097and one that is significantly more shareholder-\nfriendly than the right at most other S&P 500 companies.\nOf the 314 S&P 500 companies that permit shareholders to\ncall a special meeting, more than 84% of those companies\nhave a stock ownership threshold greater than 10%, with\nthe most prevalent stock ownership threshold set at 25%,\nand no companies have a threshold lower than our 10%\nthreshold. In 2015, we were among the first companies to\nadopt a proxy access Bylaw provision. This provision\nallows shareholders owning 3% or more of our outstanding\ncommon stock, including groups of up to 20 shareholders\nwho collectively own 3% or more of our outstanding stock,\nthe right to nominate director candidates constituting up\nto 20% of our Board, and to solicit votes for those\ncandidates using our proxy materials. This proxy access\nright and the ability for 10% of our shareholders to call\na special meeting each allow our shareholders to voice\ntheir views in a way that is less onerous than by using\nthe proposal\u0092s written consent, which would require\nproposed actions to be approved by holders of at least a\nmajority (or higher when required by Delaware law) of our\noutstanding shares. In addition, fewer than 2.8% of S&P\n500 companies provide for action by written consent\ntogether with proxy access and the ability of 10% of\nshareholders to call a special meeting.

At least twice\nannually, management invites our 250 largest\ninstitutional investors and a number of other active\ninstitutional investors, representing more than 61% of\nour outstanding shares, to engage with us. As described\nin \u0093Shareholder engagement\u0094 on page 30 of this proxy\nstatement, in 2020-21management and our Board\u0092s Lead\nIndependent Director held approximately 43 meetings with\nshareholders representing approximately 2.1 billion\nshares of our outstanding common stock. At these\nmeetings, we solicit our shareholders\u0092 input on important\nperformance, governance, executive compensation, human\ncapital management, regulatory, environmental, social,\nand other matters. We maintain a two-waydialogue to\nclarify and deepen our Board\u0092s understanding of\nshareholder concerns, and provide shareholders with\ninsight into our Board\u0092s processes. Moreover, input\nreceived from our shareholders and other stakeholders as\npart of our year-roundengagement program has resulted in\na number of enhancements in our corporate governance,\nESG, and executive compensation policies. For example, on\npage 32 of this proxy statement, we report on actions we\nhave taken as a result of our extensive shareholder\nengagement activities.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 6).                       \n                                                    \n                         \n  86    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 5-8: Shareholder proposals Proposal 7:\nShareholder proposal requesting a change in\norganizational form John C. Harrington, 1001 2nd Street,\nSuite 325, Napa, CA 94559, has advised us that he intends\nto present the following resolution: Bank of America \u0096\n2021 Whereas, our company\u0092s Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer in August 2019, signed a \u0093Statement on the\nPurpose of a Corporation,\u0094 committing our company to all\nstakeholders, supporting \u0093 ... the communities in which\nwe work ... respect[ing] the people in our communities\nand protect[ing] the environment by embracing\nsustainability practices across our businesses;\u0094 and\nWhereas, inconsistent with our bank\u0092s \u0093embrace of\nsustainability,\u0094 our bank from 2016 through 2019 loaned\nover $156 billion in fossil fuel financing according to\nBanking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report\n2020, helping to drive multigenerational climate change.\nThe commitment of bank policy to all stakeholders, and to\nsustainability such as addressing climate impacts, raises\npotential conflicts for board members bound by fiduciary\nduties reflected in our company\u0092s Bylaws, Articles of\nIncorporation, Committee Charters, and Delaware law.\nFortunately, the State of Delaware in 2013 enacted a law\nto permit Delaware corporations to amend their\nCertificates of Incorporation to become a Public Benefit\nCorporation (PBC), to commit to operate in a responsible\nand sustainable manner; and Whereas, pursuant to Delaware\nlaw, a \u0093public benefit\u0094 is to encourage corporations to\noperate in such a manner that is in the best interests of\nthose materially affected by its conduct, which includes\nother stakeholders in addition to shareholders; and\nWhereas, recently Delaware adopted new amendments to the\npublic benefit law that made the adoption of the new\nstructure more attractive and accessible. [https:\n//www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-amendments-to-delaware-\ngeneral-76927/]. The amended law reduces certain board\nmember fiduciary liabilities for breaches of stakeholder\ninterests, and reduces the required shareholder approval\nof the conversion to a majority vote; and Whereas, in the\nopinion of the proponent, this law seems to be consistent\nwith our company\u0092s commitment to the Statement on the\nPurpose of the Corporation, providing the opportunity for\nthe board to legally articulate the purpose of our\ncorporation in a manner that would reconcile\naccountability to stakeholders, therefore, be it\nResolved, that shareholders request the Board to approve\nan amendment to the Company\u0092s Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation to become a Public Benefit Corporation\npursuant to Delaware law and to submit the proposed\namendment to the shareholders for approval. Such a change\nwould enable the company to operate in a responsible and\nsustainable manner that balances the stockholders\u0092\npecuniary interests, and the best interests of those\nstakeholders affected by the corporation\u0092s conduct.\nSupporting Statement:The proponent recommends that the\nBoard, in its discretion, consider stating a public\npurpose in the amended certificate that reflects a\nforward looking vision regarding the company\u0092s impacts on\nstakeholders. For example, the purpose in the certificate\ncould be stated as \u0093providing fair, inclusive and\nequitable access to financial services in a diverse\nworld.\u0094 Our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094 Proposal 7\nbecause:\n                                                         \n      We operate our company in a responsible and        \n      sustainable manner that balances the shareholders\u0092  \n      interests, and the                                 \n      interests of those stakeholders affected by our    \n      company\u0092s conduct, and we do not need to undergo a  \n      change in corporate form to deliver Responsible    \n      Growth;                                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Our Board supports our Chairman and CEO\u0092s decision  \n      to endorse the Business Roundtable\u0092s Statement on   \n      the                                                \n      Purpose of a Corporation, which we believe is      \n      consistent with our commitment to delivering       \n      long-term value for our shareholders through       \n      sustainable Responsible Growth;                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Our Board and ESG Committee are actively engaged   \n      in managing our ESG programs and strengthening     \n      our ESG practices to                               \n      support Responsible Growth and help drive the      \n      global economy;                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Our company aligns its policies, practices,        \n      products, and programs to deliver Responsible      \n      Growth;                                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      The public benefit corporation model is new,       \n      largely untested, and is therefore inappropriate   \n      for a company of our size                          \n      and complexity.                                    \n                                                         \nThe proposal requests that the Board take the steps\nnecessary to amend the company\u0092s Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation to become a public benefit corporation\nunder Delaware law.

Further, as we have described in this proxy\nstatement, we are already operating our company to drive\nand deliver Responsible Growth, and do not need to\nundergo the radical change in corporate form to operate\n\u0093in a responsible and sustainable manner.\u0094 Moreover, the\nDelaware public benefit corporation model, which is new\nand largely untested, is inappropriate for our company.\nAccordingly, our Board believes that a change in the\ncompany\u0092s organizational form is unnecessary. We operate\nour company in a responsible and sustainable manner that\nbalances our shareholders\u0092 interests, and the interests\nof those stakeholders affected by our company\u0092s conduct,\nand we do not need to undergo a change in corporate form\nto deliver Responsible Growth.The proposal claims that\nundergoing the corporate transformation to a Delaware\npublic benefit corporation \u0093would enable the company to\noperate in a responsible and sustainable manner that\nbalances the [share]holders\u0092 pecuniary interests, and the\nbest interests of those stakeholders affected by the\ncorporation\u0092s conduct.\u0094 At Bank of America, we believe we\nmust continue to serve our clients, deliver great returns\nfor shareholders, be a great place to work for teammates\nAND help drive progress on societal priorities in the\ncommunities in which we operate. As we have demonstrated\nand disclosed throughout this proxy statement, we are\nalready operating the company \u0093in a responsible and\nsustainable manner\u0094\u0097that reflects the core proposition to\nResponsible Growth. Going through the expense and efforts\nto radically change our corporate form would not improve\nour ability to drive and deliver Responsible Growth.\nFurther, as we note below, there is considerable risk\ninvolved in changing our corporate form to a public\nbenefit corporation. We and our stakeholders are better\nserved by continuing our focus on delivering Responsible\nGrowth rather than undertaking the risky experiment the\nproponent advocates. Our Board supports our Chairman and\nCEO\u0092s decision to endorse the Business Roundtable\u0092s\nStatement on the Purpose of a Corporation, which we\nbelieve is consistent with our commitment to delivering\nlong-term value for our shareholders through Responsible\nGrowth.Issued in August 2019 by the Business Roundtable,\nthe Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation was signed\nby 181 corporate chief executive officers, including our\nChairman and CEO, Mr. Moynihan. As signatories to the\nstatement, each chief executive officer supported the\npolicy of leading his or her company for the benefit of\nmultiple stakeholders\u0097customers, employees, suppliers,\ncommunities, and shareholders. In acknowledging their\n\u0093fundamental commitment\u0094 to these stakeholders, the\nsignatories pledged support to the statement\u0092s five core\ncommitments: delivering value to customers; investing in\nemployees; dealing fairly and ethically with suppliers;\nsupporting the communities in which the company works;\nand generating long-term value for shareholders.

Notably, none of\nthese publicly traded public benefit corporations are\nbank holding or financial holding companies with the\nglobal scope of our company nor do they operate in the\nsame complex regulatory environment. Given the\nnonexistence of precedent for the management and board\noversight of public benefit corporations the size and\nscope of our company, there is significant uncertainty\nregarding decision-making in a public benefit corporation\nwhen encountering a situation where the interests of\nshareholders and other stakeholders or the public benefit\ndiverge. Importantly, the Delaware public benefit\ncorporation statute requires a public benefit\ncorporation\u0092s certificate of incorporation to identify\none or more specific public benefits to be promoted by\nthe corporation, and here the proposal does not identify\nwhich public benefits it would ask shareholders to\nendorse, as to which shareholders could have differing\nviews. Furthermore, due to the lack of precedent\nconcerning a publicly traded corporation converting to a\npublic benefit corporation, it is extremely difficult to\npredict the impact that such action would have on our\nshareholders and our company\u0092s long-term success. The\nrisks and costs of implementing such a change in\ncorporate form are also expected to be extensive and\ncould include, but are not limited to: risk in our\nability to receive necessary regulatory approvals for\nsuch a change in corporate form; tax risk to shareholders\nin the corporate reorganization; and lack of data on\nmarket valuations of public benefit corporations that may\nlead to increased volatility in our stock price or a\nlower price-earnings multiple for our stock. In light of\nour demonstrated commitment to Responsible Growth and the\ncore commitments of the Business Roundtable\u0092s Statement\non the Purpose of a Corporation, the unnecessary need to\nchange our corporate form to continue delivering\nResponsible Growth, and the lack of precedent and\nuncertainties around the public benefit corporation model\nfor a company of our size and complexity, we believe that\nthe change in our company\u0092s organizational form requested\nin the proposal is unnecessary.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 7).                       \n                                                    \nProposal 8: Shareholder proposal requesting a racial\nequity audit CtW Investment Group, 1900 L Street NW,\nSuite 900, Washington, DC 20036, has advised us that it\nintends to present the following resolution: RESOLVED\nthat shareholders of Bank of America Corporation (\u0093BofA\u0094)\nurge the Board of Directors to oversee a racial equity\naudit analyzing BofA\u0092s adverse impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color. Input from civil\nrights organizations, employees, and customers should be\nconsidered in determining the specific matters to be\nanalyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at reasonable\ncost and omitting confidential or proprietary\ninformation, should be publicly disclosed on BofA\u0092s\nwebsite. SUPPORTING STATEMENT High-profile police\nkillings of Black people\u0097most recently George Floyd\u0097have\ngalvanized the movement for racial justice. That\nmovement, together with the disproportionate impacts of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic have focused the attention of the\nmedia, the public, and policy makers on systemic racism,\nracialized violence and inequities in employment, health\ncare, and the criminal justice system. In June 2020, BofA\nCEO Brian Moynahan [sic] noted the urgency in addressing\n\u0093racial injustices we have seen in the communities where\nwe work and live ....\u0094 BofA has committed $1 billion over\nfour years to address issues like healthcare, jobs,\nsupporting minority owned small businesses, and housing.\nBofA has a conflicted history when it comes to addressing\nracial injustice within the communities it serves. In\n2018, the Treasury Department\u0092s Office of the Comptroller\nfound that the bank offered proportionately fewer home\nloans to minorities than to white applicants in\nPhiladelphia.

In 2018, the bank began to\nimpose a minimum maintenance fee of $12 per month for\nchecking account customers or a minimum daily balance of\n$1500. Such minimum fees and balances disproportionately\nimpact people of color and can inhibit wealth creation\namong these communities. Lastly, we note that only 8% of\nexecutives within BofA\u0092s C-Suite are Black. The impact of\nBofA\u0092s practices on communities of color is not limited\nto the lending and employment contexts. In 2009 and 2010,\nLos Angeles issued $71.4 million in judgment obligation\nbonds, a portion of which was used to pay for police\nrelated settlements. By the time these bonds are paid\noff, BofA and other banks involved in this issuance will\nhave received $18 million. BofA\u0092s charitable\ncontributions are not fully aligned with its public\nstatements: BofA has donated to police foundations in New\nYork, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, which bypass normal\nprocurement processes to buy equipment for police\ndepartments, including surveillance technology that has\nbeen used to target communities of color and nonviolent\nprotestors. A racial equity audit will help BofA\nidentify, prioritize, remedy and avoid adverse impacts on\nnonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. We urge\nBofA to assess its behavior through a racial equity lens\nin order to obtain a complete picture of how it\ncontributes to, and could help dismantle, systemic\nracism.

In addition, the\nBoard\u0092s Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees\nour human capital management practices and receives\nregular reports from our Chief Human Resources Officer,\nwho is a member of the Global ESG Committee. For example,\nin 2020, the Board or its committees received information\nabout the following topics, among others:\n                                                         \n      our $1 billion commitment to advance racial        \n      equality and economic opportunity, including the   \n      status of activity;                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      our banking strategies for low- and                \n      moderate-income (LMI) communities, including       \n      communities of color, with information             \n      about products, employment, professional           \n      development, and investment, and philanthropic     \n      capital in LMI communities; and                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      our strategies for enhancing representation of,    \n      and professional development for, our diverse      \n      teammates for each of our                          \n      eight lines of business and each of our staff      \n      areas, including information about representation  \n      at management levels, our Employee Engagement      \n      Satisfaction Survey results, and results of pay    \n      equity analyses for people of color teammates.     \n                                                         \nIntegral to sustainable Responsible Growth is sharing our\nsuccess with the communities in which we operate, which\nwe do through ESG leadership, including taking action to\ndrive progress on racial and economic inequality in the\nUnited States.Our company believes that we have a role to\nplay in helping communities move forward. This\nunderstanding is core to our company\u0092s commitment to\nResponsible Growth and to the people and communities we\nserve. As part of that commitment, our company knows that\nit must take action to address the real consequences of\nsystemic racism. As one example of how we drive progress,\nin June 2020 our company announced its commitment to\ninvest $1 billion over four years to advance racial\nequality and economic opportunity, building on work we\u0092ve\nhad underway for many years. Our actions will help\naddress critical issues and long-term gaps, including\nskills and job readiness, medical capacity and access,\nsmall business support, and affordable housing. Our Board\nprovides oversight of this initiative, which is being led\nby our company\u0092s Vice Chairman and head of ESG, Capital\nDeployment and Public Policy, in coordination with\nbusiness lines and business support areas. In September\n2020, we directed $300 million of our $1 billion\ncommitment to four key areas across 91 U.S. markets and\nglobally:\n                                                         \n      Jobs and Reskilling: $25 million in support of     \n      jobs initiatives in Black and Hispanic/Latino      \n      communities, including                             \n      $1 million donations each to 21 community          \n      colleges, historically Black colleges and          \n      universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions;   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Health and Healthcare: $25 million in support of   \n      community outreach and initiatives, including      \n      philanthropic support                              \n      to underserved and minority communities adversely  \n      impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and          \n      personal protection equipment to communities in    \n      need;                                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Affordable Housing: $50 million in direct equity   \n      investments to Minority Depository Institutions    \n      (MDIs) (in addition                                \n      to over $100 million in deposits from Bank of      \n      America in MDIs) to facilitate benefits across     \n      multiple states in the communities they serve      \n      through lending, housing, neighborhood             \n      revitalization, and other banking services; and    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Small Business Support: $200 million of            \n      proprietary equity investments in minority         \n      entrepreneurs, businesses, and                     \n      funds.                                             \n                                                         \nThis work builds on actions the company had previously\ntaken, including an additional $100 million to support\nnonprofit partners across our communities, toward medical\nsupplies, food security, and other vital support during\nthe pandemic, and a $250 million commitment to community\ndevelopment financial institution banks (CDFIs) to assist\nwith lending to the smallest and minority-owned\nbusinesses (as part of our $1.8 billion CDFI portfolio\nwith 256 partner CDFIs across all 50 states, providing\naccess to capital to thousands of individuals and small\nbusinesses who do not qualify through traditional\nlenders). In 2020 we also issued a $2 billion Equality\nProgress Sustainability Bond, the first-of-its-kind in\nthe financial services industry. Proceeds from the social\nportion of the issuance are dedicated to financial\nempowerment of Black and Hispanic/Latino communities,\nincluding:\n                                                         \n      Mortgage lending, construction loans, and other    \n      financing and investments relating to single or    \n      multi-family housing or                            \n      affordable housing projects;                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Financing for medical professionals to create or   \n      expand medical, veterinary, and dental practices;  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Supply chain finance loans to be offered directly  \n      to minority-owned business enterprises;            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Deposits and equity investments in Black and       \n      Hispanic/Latino MDIs that are also CDFIs; and      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Equity investments in Black and Hispanic/Latino    \n      owned or operated businesses and funds that        \n      invest in Black and                                \n      Hispanic/Latino owned businesses.                  \n                                                         \nResponsible Growth has a positive benefit on our clients\nand communities by advancing projects and issues that\ncontribute to real economic growth and mobility\u0097whether\nthrough supporting the small businesses that are\nessential to the well-being of local communities or\nthrough projects that create jobs and drive the\neconomy.The proposal assumes our company has \u0093adverse\nimpacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of\ncolor.\u0094 We believe the results of our activities\ndemonstrate the converse is true, and we devote\nsignificant resources and effort to strengthen the local\ncommunities where we operate and offer products and\nservices to make customers\u0092 financial lives better. We\nare committed to serving individuals and small businesses\nin underserved communities. Approximately one-third of\nour financial centers and ATMs are located in LMI\nneighborhoods. Through our community-centered approach,\nwe work to meet our clients\u0092 and neighbors\u0092 unique needs\nby connecting them to tailored products and services,\njobs, and capital to increase financial resilience and\nhelp our local communities thrive.

Our company website provides additional\ninformation on how our business practices align with\nResponsible Growth. (3) In addition, in response to the\nSmall Business Administration\u0092s first round of the\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP), we were the first\nmajor bank to begin accepting applications in early April\n2020. To achieve that, we redeployed and trained\nthousands of teammates and developed new technology, all\nin a matter of weeks, to become the largest PPP provider\nin the U.S. by number of approved loans. (4)In 2020, we\ndelivered more than $26 billion in PPP loan funds to\nsmall businesses in need and helped approximately 343,000\nsmall business clients\u0097in every industry, every\nmarket\u0097receive PPP loans. Of the PPP loans received by\nour clients, 99% are for companies with fewer than 100\nemployees, 82% are for companies with 10 or fewer\nemployees, 96% are for less than $350,000, 86% are for\nless than $100,000, and 24% are from LMI neighborhoods.\nWe will continue to support our small business clients\nwho have already received PPP funding through the loan\nforgiveness process and support our small business\nclients with the new round of PPP lending in 2021. Within\nMerrill and the Bank of America Private Bank, our Chief\nInvestment Office (CIO) has introduced initiatives to\npromote the representation of women and people of color\namong asset managers on our wealth management platform\nand across the industry. The CIO now incorporates\ndiversity analysis into the review and selection of all\nexisting and new asset managers. In 2020, the CIO Due\nDiligence team enhanced its investment process to\nevaluate all third-party asset managers\u0092 policies and\npractices on diversity and inclusion at both their\norganizational and investment team levels. The team also\ncollaborates with asset managers and industry groups who\nare focused on developing investment solutions that serve\nto aggregate and direct capital to diverse managers, and\nprovide capital to diverse-owned businesses and\npopulations as part of their underlying investment\nmandates. We actively engage with consumer advocates in\nthe design and marketing of our financial services and\nproducts.In keeping with our commitment to provide our\ncustomers with financial products and services that fit\nour customers\u0092 needs and goals, we rely on the advice and\nguidance provided by consumer advocates and community\nadvisors. For example, in 2005, we founded our National\nCommunity Advisory Council (NCAC), a forum for senior\nleaders from social justice, consumer advocacy, community\ndevelopment, and environmental organizations and think-\ntanks to provide external perspectives on our business\npolicies, practices, and products, including our\noverdraft policies and practices. In addition to\nproviding feedback on our financial products and\nservices, the NCAC provides us with important\nperspectives about societal challenges experienced by our\ncustomers. It is through feedback from the NCAC, our\ncustomers, and other stakeholders that we have developed\nand offer leading products and services such as\nSafeBalance Banking \u0099and our suite of products for small\nbusinesses. The proposal requires that we solicit\n\u0093[i]nput from civil rights organizations, employees, and\ncustomers\u0094 to consider the specific matters to be\nanalyzed in the one-time audit. As noted above, instead\nof a one-time audit of the type requested by this\nproposal, we routinely solicit these constituents for\nadvice and input in our products, commitments, and\nstrategies to positively and dynamically impact our\nnonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. We\nalready engage many nonwhite stakeholders on a year-round\nbasis, through a much more robust dialogue and holistic\nexchange of information than may be possible in the one-\ntime audit requested in the proposal. As described in our\n2020 Human Capital Management Report, our company focuses\nsignificant resources on hiring diverse talent, and\ndeveloping and retaining diverse talent. We value and\npromote diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our\nbusiness and at every level of our organization. Our\ncommitment to creating a diverse and inclusive\nenvironment starts at the top with our Board and\nexecutive leadership, who play a key role in the\noversight of our culture and growth of a diverse\nworkplace and an inclusive work environment. For over 20\nyears, our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council, chaired\nby our CEO and comprising of senior executives from every\narea of the company, has promoted diversity goal setting,\nwhich is embedded in our performance management system\nand occurs at all levels of the enterprise. Our company\nseeks to build a diverse pipeline of candidates for\npositions at all levels of the company, including\nleadership positions. As part of our strong diversity\npractices, we routinely disclose our company\u0092s workforce\ndiversity metrics in order to publicly hold ourselves\naccountable and to confirm whether we are delivering on\nour commitment to increase diverse representation across\nthe company wherever possible. Our commitment to\ndiversity has resulted in improvements in key workforce\ndiversity metrics. For example, as disclosed in the\ncompany\u0092s 2020 Human Capital Report, since 2015 the\ncompany has achieved marked increases in the\nrepresentation of women and people of color in management\nlevels 1-3, with a 24% and 27% increase, respectively.\nOur practices and policies have also resulted in strong\nrepresentation where our employee population mirrors the\nclients and communities we serve: over 50% women; 48%\npeople of color; 14% Black/African American; and 19%\nHispanic/Latino. Importantly, our efforts do not stop\nwith recruiting and achieving increased diverse\nrepresentation.

We\nhave established robust policies and practices to help\nguide pay decisions, and our Human Resources team,\ncompany leadership, and Board are engaged on an ongoing\nbasis to ensure pay equity. Each year, we engage in a\nthorough and rigorous inspection process, which, together\nwith our detailed governance framework and independent\nanalyses by an external consulting firm, allow us to\nidentify areas for adjustment and take appropriate action\nprior to pay decisions being made. If pay misalignment is\nidentified, we take action where appropriate to bring an\nindividual employee in line with their comparable peers,\nmaking real-time compensation adjustments as part of our\nannual year-end pay decision process. This process, which\nhas been in place for over a decade, reinforces our\nculture and commitment to equal pay for equal work. As a\nresult of our focus on pay for performance, as validated\nby the independent review, for 2020 in the U.S.,\ncompensation received by people of color is on average\ngreater than 99% of that received by non-people of color\nteammates in comparable positions. Our efforts in the\nmatters described above and many others demonstrate our\ncommitment to improving our company\u0092s impacts on nonwhite\nstakeholders and communities of color. We recognize our\nneed to do more and we are committed to further progress.\nIn light of our commitment to advancing racial equality\nand economic opportunity for our customers, communities\nand teammates, our ongoing engagement with outside\nexperts to review, assess and enhance our business, and\nthe specific actions and demonstrable progress we have\nmade with respect to those commitments, our Board\nbelieves the requested audit and related report are\nunnecessary.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 8).                       \n                                                    \nShareholder proposals for our 2022 annual meeting\nShareholder proposals submitted for inclusion in the\nproxy statement for our 2022 annual meeting must comply\nwith applicable requirements and conditions established\nby the SEC, including Rule 14a-8of the Exchange Act, and\nmust be received by our Corporate Secretary no later than\nthe close of business on November 8, 2021.

Change in Control 13.1 Treatment of\nOutstanding Awards.Unless otherwise specifically\nprohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and\nregulations of any governing governmental agencies or\nnational securities exchanges, the Committee may, in its\nsole discretion, at the time an Award is made hereunder\nor at any time prior to, coincident with or after the\ntime of a Change in Control take any one or more of the\nfollowing actions which shall apply only upon the\noccurrence of a Change in Control or, if later, upon the\naction being taken: (a) provide for the acceleration of\nany time periods, or the waiver of any other conditions,\nrelating to the vesting, exercise, payment or\ndistribution of an Award so that any Award to a\nParticipant whose employment has been terminated as a\nresult of a Change in Control may be vested, exercised,\npaid or distributed in full on or before a date fixed by\nthe Committee, and in connection therewith the Committee\nmay (i) provide for an extended period to exercise\nOptions (not to exceed the original Option term) and (ii)\ndetermine the level of attainment of any applicable\nperformance goals; (b) provide for the purchase of any\nAwards from a Participant whose employment has been\nterminated as a result of a Change in Control, upon the\nParticipant\u0092s request, for an amount of cash equal to the\namount that could have been obtained upon the exercise,\npayment or distribution of such rights had such Award\nbeen currently exercisable or payable; or (c) cause the\nAwards then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights\nsubstituted therefore, by the surviving corporation in\nsuch Change in Control. For purposes of sub-paragraphs(a)\nand (b) above, any Participant whose employment is either\n(i) terminated by the Company other than for \u0093cause,\u0094 or\n(ii) terminated by the Participant for \u0093good reason\u0094\n(each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), in\neither case upon, or on or prior to the second\nanniversary of, a Change in Control, shall be deemed to\nhave been terminated as a result of the Change in\nControl. 13.2 Limitation on Change-in-ControlBenefits. It\nis the intention of the Company and the Participants to\nreduce the amounts payable or distributable to a\nParticipant hereunder if the aggregate Net After Tax\nReceipts (as defined below) to the Participant would\nthereby be increased, as a result of the application of\nthe excise tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Code.\nAccordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary\nnotwithstanding, in the event that the certified public\naccountants regularly employed by the Company immediately\nprior to any \u0093change\u0094 described below (the \u0093Accounting\nFirm\u0094) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as\ndefined below) would subject the Participant to tax under\nSection 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some\namount of Payments would meet the definition of a\n\u0093Reduced Amount\u0094 (as defined below). If the Accounting\nFirm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the\naggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced\nAmount in accordance with the provisions of Section\n13.2(b) below. (a) For purposes of this Section 13.2(a):\n(i) A \u0093Payment\u0094 shall mean any payment or distribution in\nthe nature of compensation to or for the benefit of a\nParticipant who is a \u0093disqualified individual\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and which is\ncontingent on a \u0093change\u0094 described in Section\n280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code with respect to the Company,\nwhether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or\notherwise; (ii) \u0093Plan Payment\u0094 shall mean a Payment paid\nor payable pursuant to this Plan (disregarding this\nSection 13.2); (iii) \u0093Net After Tax Receipt\u0094 shall mean\nthe Present Value of a Payment, net of all taxes imposed\non the Participant with respect thereto under Sections 1\nand 4999 of the Code, determined by applying the highest\nmarginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which applied\nto the Participant\u0092s Federal taxable income for the\nimmediately preceding taxable year; (iv) \u0093Present Value\u0094\nshall mean such value determined in accordance with\nSection 280G(d)(4) of the Code; and (v) \u0093Reduced Amount\u0094\nshall mean the smallest aggregate amount of Payments\nwhich (A) is less than the sum of all Payments and (B)\nresults in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are\nequal to or greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which\nwould result if all Payments were paid to or for the\nbenefit of the Participant. (b) If the Accounting Firm\ndetermines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to\nthe Reduced Amount, the Committee shall promptly give the\nParticipant notice to that effect and a copy of the\ndetailed calculation thereof. The Company shall reduce or\neliminate the Payments, by first reducing or eliminating\nthe portion of the Payments which are not payable in cash\nand then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in\neach case in reverse order beginning with payments or\nbenefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from\nthe\n                                \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    B-10  \n                                \nAppendix B: Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan\ndetermination, all as determined by the Accounting Firm.\nAll determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this\nSection 13.2 shall be binding upon the Company and the\nParticipant and shall be made within sixty (60) days\nimmediately following the event constituting the \u0093change\u0094\nreferred to above. As promptly as practicable following\nsuch determination, the Company shall pay to or\ndistribute for the benefit of the Participant such\nPayments as are then due to the Participant under this\nPlan. (c) At the time of the initial determination by the\nAccounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts\nwill have been paid or distributed by the Company to or\nfor the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan\nwhich should not have been so paid or distributed\n(\u0093Overpayment\u0094) or that additional amounts which will\nhave not been paid or distributed by the Company to or\nfor the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan\ncould have been so paid or distributed (\u0093Underpayment\u0094),\nin each case, consistent with the calculation of the\nReduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the\nAccounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a\ndeficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the\nCompany or the Participant which the Accounting Firm\nbelieves has a high probability of success or controlling\nprecedent or other substantial authority, determines that\nan Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid\nor distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of\nthe Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a\nloan ab initio to the Participant which the Participant\nshall repay to the Company together with interest at the\napplicable Federal rate provided for in Section\n7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such\nloan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount\nshall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and\nto the extent (i) such deemed loan and payment would not\neither reduce the amount on which the Participant is\nsubject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the\nCode or generate a refund of such taxes or (ii) the\nParticipant is subject to the prohibition on personal\nloans under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon\ncontrolling precedent or other substantial authority,\ndetermines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such\nUnderpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or\nfor the benefit of the Participant together with interest\nat the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section\n7872(f)(2) of the Code. 13.3 Termination, Amendment, and\nModifications of Change-in-ControlProvisions.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any\nAward Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article\n13 may not be terminated, amended, or modified on or\nafter the date of a Change in Control to affect adversely\nany Award theretofore granted under the Plan without the\nprior written consent of the Participant with respect to\nsaid Participant\u0092s outstanding Awards; provided, however,\nthe Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the\nCommittee, may terminate, amend, or modify this Article\n13 at any time and from time to time prior to the date of\na Change in Control. Article 14. Amendment, Modification,\nand Termination 14.1 Amendment, Modification, and\nTermination. The Board may at any time and from time to\ntime, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in\nwhole or in part; provided, however, that an amendment to\nthe Plan may be conditioned on the approval of the\nstockholders of the Company if and to the extent the\nBoard determines that stockholder approval is necessary\nor appropriate. 14.2 Awards Previously Granted. No\ntermination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall\nadversely affect in any material way any Award previously\ngranted under the Plan, without the written consent of\nthe Participant holding such Award. 14.3 No Repricing.\nNotwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the\nrepricing of Options or SARs is prohibited without prior\napproval of the Company\u0092s stockholders. For this purpose,\na \u0093repricing\u0094 means any of the following (or any other\naction that has the same effect as any of the following):\n(A) changing the terms of an Option or SAR to lower its\nOption Price or grant price; (B) any other action that is\ntreated as a \u0093repricing\u0094 under generally accepted\naccounting principles; and (C) repurchasing for cash or\ncanceling an Option or SAR at a time when its Option\nPrice or grant price is greater than the Fair Market\nValue of the underlying Shares in exchange for another\nAward, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in\nconnection with a change in capitalization or similar\nchange under Section 4.6 above. Such cancellation and\nexchange would be considered a \u0093repricing\u0094 regardless of\nwhether it is treated as a \u0093repricing\u0094 under generally\naccepted accounting principles and regardless of whether\nit is voluntary on the part of the Participant. Article\n15. Withholding 15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall\nhave the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or\nrequire a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount\nsufficient to satisfy Federal, state, local, foreign or\nother taxes (including the Participant\u0092s FICA or other\napplicable social tax obligation) required by law to be\nwithheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a\nresult of this Plan. 15.2 Share Withholding. The Company\nmay cause any tax withholding obligation described in\nSection 15.1 to be satisfied by the Company withholding\nShares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is\nto be determined equal to the required tax withholding\nimposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum\nstatutory rates). In the alternative, the Company may\npermit Participants to elect to satisfy the tax\nwithholding obligation, in whole or in part, by either\n(a) having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair\nMarket Value on the date the tax is to be determined\nequal to the required tax withholding imposed on the\ntransaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates) or\n(b) tendering previously acquired Shares having an\naggregate Fair Market Value equal to the required tax\nwithholding imposed on the transaction (not to exceed\nmaximum statutory rates). All such elections shall be\nirrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant,\nand shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations\nthat the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems\nappropriate.\n                           \n  B-11    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \nAppendix B: Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan\nArticle 16.

Article 18. Legal\nConstruction 18.1 Gender and Number. Except where\notherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term\nused herein also shall include the feminine; the plural\nshall include the singular and the singular shall include\nthe plural. 18.2 Severability. In the event any provision\nof the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any\nreason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the\nremaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be\nconstrued and enforced as if the illegal or invalid\nprovision had not been included. 18.3 Requirements of\nLaw. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares\nunder the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any\ngovernmental agencies or national securities exchanges as\nmay be required. 18.4 Securities Law Compliance. With\nrespect to Insiders, transactions under this Plan are\nintended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule\n16b-3or its successors under the Exchange Act. To the\nextent any provision of the plan or action by the\nCommittee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and\nvoid, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable\nby the Committee. 18.5 No Conflict. Unless otherwise\nprovided for by an Award Agreement, in the event of any\nconflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of\nan Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control.\n18.6 Governing Law. To the extent not preempted by\nFederal law, the Plan, and all agreements hereunder,\nshall be construed in accordance with and governed by the\nlaws of the State of Delaware. 18.7 Compliance With Code\nSection 409A.

Subject\nto the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Board, at\nany time and from time to time, may grant Shares of\nRestricted Stock to Non-EmployeeDirectors in such amounts\nas the Board shall determine. Notwithstanding the\ndefinition of \u0093Participant\u0094 provided in Article 2 above,\nupon receipt of a grant of Shares of Restricted Stock, a\nNon-EmployeeDirector shall be considered a Participant in\nthe Plan. Each grant of Shares of Restricted Stock to a\nNon-EmployeeDirector shall be evidenced by an Award\nAgreement that shall specify the Period or Periods of\nRestriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock\ngranted, and such other provisions as the Board shall\ndetermine. 19.2 Administration. The Board shall be\nresponsible for administering any grants of Restricted\nStock to Non-EmployeeDirectors and shall have all of the\npowers necessary to enable it to properly carry out its\nduties hereunder.

The Board shall have such other\nand further specified duties, powers, authority and\ndiscretion as are elsewhere in the Plan either expressly\nor by necessary implication conferred upon it. The Board\nmay appoint such agents as it may deem necessary for the\neffective performance of its duties, and may delegate to\nsuch agents such powers and duties as the Board may deem\nexpedient or appropriate that are not inconsistent with\nthe intent of the Plan and this Article 19.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the\ncontrary, Shares of Restricted Stock granted to Non-\nEmployeeDirectors shall not become vested until the first\nanniversary of the applicable date of grant (or, if\nearlier, the date of the next annual meeting of the\nstockholders of the Company) (the \u0093 Non-EmployeeDirector\nVesting Date\u0094), provided that if the Non-EmployeeDirector\nVesting Date occurs less than 50 weeks after the\napplicable date of grant, it shall count against the 5%\nexception pool to the minimum vesting requirements set\nforth in Section 3.4. If the Non-EmployeeDirector ceases\nto serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector before the Non-\nEmployeeDirector Vesting Date due to the Non-Employee\n                                \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    B-12  \n                                \nAppendix B: Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan\nDirector\u0092s death, or if there is a Change in Control\nprior to the Vesting Date, then the Shares shall become\nfully vested as of the date of such death or Change in\nControl, as applicable. If the Non-EmployeeDirector\nceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector at any time for\nany reason other than death before the earlier of the\nVesting Date or a Change in Control, then the Shares\nshall become vested pro rata (based on the number of days\nbetween the grant date of the Shares of Restricted Stock,\nor in the case of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a\nnewly appointed Non-EmployeeDirector, the date of\ncommencement of services, and the date of cessation of\nservices divided by (a) 365 days for grants made at an\nannual stockholders meeting or (b) the number of days\nfrom the date of commencement of services until the next\nannual stockholders meeting for grants made to a newly\nappointed Non-EmployeeDirector), and to the extent the\nShares are not thereby vested they shall be forfeited as\nof the date of such cessation of services. A Non-\nEmployeeDirector may not sell, transfer or otherwise\ndispose of any Shares of Restricted Stock until they\nbecome vested; however, the Non-EmployeeDirector shall\nhave the right to receive dividends with respect to the\nShares and to vote the Shares prior to vesting. If a Non-\nEmployeeDirector has elected to defer any Shares of\nRestricted Stock pursuant to the Bank of America\nCorporation Director Deferral Plan (or any other similar\nplan in which the Non-EmployeeDirector participates,\nincluding any successor or replacement plan) (a \u0093\nDeferral Plan\u0094), then (i) such Shares shall not be issued\nunder this Plan, (ii) the Non-EmployeeDirector shall be\ncredited with \u0093Stock Units\u0094 to be paid in cash when and\nas provided for under the Deferral Plan, and (iii) the\nvesting provisions set forth above shall apply to any\nsuch Shares that are deferred as Stock Units under the\nDeferral Plan. 19.4 No Other Awards.
