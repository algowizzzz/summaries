We value our    \u2502\n\u2502  employees and seek to establish and maintain human resource policies that     \u2502\n\u2502  are consistent with our core values and help to realize the power of our      \u2502\n\u2502  people. Our Board and its Compensation and Human Capital Committee provide    \u2502\n\u2502  oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs, initiatives   \u2502\n\u2502  and practices.

In addition, we have\npractices in place for attracting diverse talent, including campus recruitment.\nFor example, in 2023, 44 percent of our global campus hires were women and, in the\nU.S., 62 percent were people of color. Employee Engagement and Talent Retention As\npart of our ongoing efforts to make the Corporation a great place to work, we\nconduct a confidential annual Employee Engagement Survey (Survey) and have done so\nfor nearly two decades. The Survey results are reviewed by the Board and senior\nmanagement and used to assist in reviewing the Corporation\u2019s human capital\nstrategies, programs, initiatives and practices. In 2023, 88 percent of the\nCorporation\u2019s employees participated in the Survey, and our Employee Engagement\nIndex, an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation, was 87\npercent. Our turnover among employees was eight percent in 2023 and 13 percent in\n2022. Additionally, the Corporation provides a variety of resources to help\nemployees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including resources to\nhelp employees find new opportunities, re-skill and seek leadership positions. The\nlearning and development strategy is grounded in the\n\ndevelopment of horizontal skills delivered throughout the organization. Senior\nleaders, managers and teammates are onboarded and build both horizontal and role-\nspecific skills, to help drive high performance. This approach also helps\nfacilitate internal mobility and promotion of talent to build a bench of qualified\nmanagers and leaders. In 2023, more than 5,000 employees found new roles within\nthe Corporation, and we delivered approximately 6.7 million hours of training and\ndevelopment to our teammates through Bank of America Academy. Additionally, our\nBoard oversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally\nreviewed at least annually. Fair and Equitable Compensation Our compensation\nphilosophy is to pay for performance over the long term, as well as on an annual\nbasis. Our performance considerations encompass both financial and nonfinancial\nmeasures, including the manner in which results are achieved. These considerations\nare designed to reinforce and promote our Responsible Growth strategy and maintain\nalignment with our Risk Framework. The Corporation is committed to racial and\ngender pay equity and strives to compensate all of our employees fairly and\nequitably. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our\ncommitment, including reviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight\nfrom our Board and senior management. In 2023, our review showed that compensation\nreceived by women globally, on average, was greater than 99 percent of that\nreceived by men in comparable positions. In the U.S., compensation received by\npeople of color was, on average, greater than 99 percent of that received by\nteammates who are not people of color in comparable positions. We pay our\nemployees fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience and how they\nperform. We regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside\nour industry to confirm our pay is competitive. In 2021, the Corporation announced\nit would increase its minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 per hour by\n2025. In October 2023, as a next step towards that goal, the Corporation increased\nits hourly minimum wage for U.S. employees to $23 per hour. In addition, in\nJanuary 2024, for the seventh year since 2017, we announced that we recognized our\nteammates with Sharing Success compensation awards for their efforts during 2023.\nApproximately 97 percent of employees globally will receive an award in the first\nquarter of 2024. Health and Wellness \u2013 2023 Focus The Corporation is also\ncommitted to providing employees with access to leading benefits and programs that\nhelp promote their physical, emotional and financial wellness. Investments we make\nin our teammates are designed to help them thrive, both at work and at home,\nenabling them to better deliver for our clients, communities and each other. We\ncontinued our efforts to provide affordable access to healthcare, including\noffering no-cost, 24/7 access to virtual general medical and behavioral health\nresources to help our enrolled U.S. teammates stay healthy. We kept U.S. health\ninsurance premiums unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000 for the\neleventh year in a row and had nominal premium increases for teammates earning\nfrom $50,000 up to $100,000 for the seventh year in a row. We provided in-network\ngeneric prescription medications at no cost for teammates enrolled in a U.S. bank\nmedical PPO or Consumer Direct plan, and we continue to provide preventative care\nmedications at no cost for all teammates enrolled in U.S. medical plans. We also\n                                                                                  \n  3Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \ncontinued to enhance access to care\nacross the Corporation, through near-\nsite health centers, vaccination clinics\nand wellness screenings in many of our\nU.S. locations, as we believe primary\nand preventive care are important to our\nteammates\u2019 health and safety.\n\nWe offer an extensive benefit package\nand support work-life balance for our\nteammates, which includes in the U.S.,\n16 weeks of paid parental leave for both\nprimary and secondary caregivers and 50\ndays per year of child and adult backup\ndependent care. Globally, teammates and\nmembers of their households can utilize\nour Employee Assistance Program for 12\nfree, in-person confidential counseling\nsessions, and unlimited phone\nconsultations. Beginning in 2023,\nteammates celebrating at least 15 years\nof continuous service with the\nCorporation may participate in its\nglobal Sabbatical Program.\n\nFor more information about our human\ncapital management, see the\nCorporation\u2019s website and 2023 Annual\nReport to shareholders that we expect to\nbe available on the Investor Relations\nportion of our website in March 2024\n(the content of which is not\nincorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K).\n                                                                                  \n  Government Supervision and Regulation                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe following discussion describes,\namong other things, elements of an\nextensive regulatory framework\napplicable to BHCs, financial holding\ncompanies, banks and broker-dealers,\nincluding specific information about\nBank of America.\n\nWe are subject to an extensive\nregulatory framework applicable to BHCs,\nfinancial holding companies and banks\nand other financial services entities.\nU.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs\nand financial holding companies is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and the Deposit Insurance\nFund (DIF) rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and\ncreditors.\n\nAs a registered financial holding\ncompany and BHC, the Corporation is\nsubject to the supervision of, and\nregular inspection by, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries (the Banks), organized as\nnational banking associations, are\nsubject to regulation, supervision and\nexamination by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC have adopted guidelines that\nestablish minimum standards for the\ndesign, implementation and board\noversight of BHCs\u2019 and national banks\u2019\nrisk governance frameworks. U.S.\nfinancial holding companies, and the\ncompanies under their control, are\npermitted to engage in activities\nconsidered \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d as\ndefined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nand related Federal Reserve\ninterpretations. The Corporation's\nstatus as a financial holding company is\nconditioned upon maintaining certain\neligibility requirements for both the\nCorporation and its U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiaries, including\nminimum capital ratios, supervisory\nratings and, in the case of the\ndepository institutions, at least\nsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act\nratings. Failure to be an eligible\nfinancial holding company could result\nin the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of\nAmerica's activities, including\npotential acquisitions. Additionally, we\nare subject to a significant number of\nlaws, rules and regulations that govern\nour businesses in the U.S. and in the\nother jurisdictions in which we operate,\nincluding permissible activities,\nminimum levels of capital and liquidity,\ncompliance risk management, consumer\nproducts and sales practices, privacy,\ndata protection and executive\ncompensation, among others.\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations\nand the intensity of the supervision to\nwhich we are subject have increased over\nthe past several years, beginning with\nthe response to the 2008 financial\ncrisis, as well as other factors such as\ntechnological and market changes. In\naddition, the banking and financial\nservices sector is subject to\nsubstantial regulatory enforcement and\nfines. Many of these changes have\noccurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the Financial Reform\nAct). We cannot assess whether or not\nthere will be any additional major\nchanges in the regulatory environment\nand expect that our business will remain\nsubject to continuing and extensive\nregulation and supervision.\n\nWe are also subject to various other\nlaws and regulations, as well as\nsupervision and examination by other\nregulatory agencies, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly affect our\nentities, management and ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. For\ninstance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to both U.S. and\ninternational regulation, including\nsupervision by the SEC, Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority and New\nYork Stock Exchange, among others; our\nfutures commission merchant subsidiary\nsupporting commodities and derivatives\nbusinesses in the U.S. is subject to\nregulation by and supervision of the\nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC), National Futures\nAssociation, the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange, and in the case of the Banks,\ncertain banking regulators; our\ninsurance activities are subject to\nlicensing and regulation by state\ninsurance regulatory agencies; and our\nconsumer financial products and services\nare regulated by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB). In addition,\ncertain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries\nare also registered with the CFTC as\nswap dealers, and conditionally\nregistered with the SEC as security-\nbased swap dealers.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by various\nnon-U.S. regulators, including\ngovernments, securities exchanges,\nprudential regulators, central banks and\nother regulatory bodies, in the\njurisdictions in which those businesses\noperate. For example, our financial\nservices entities in the United Kingdom\n(U.K.), Ireland and France are subject\nto regulation by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority and Financial\nConduct Authority, the European Central\nBank and Central Bank of Ireland, and\nthe Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et\nde R\u00e9solution and Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s\nFinanciers, respectively.\n\nThe Corporation is also subject to\nextensive laws, rules and regulations in\nthe U.S. and in the other jurisdictions\nin which it operates regarding bribery\nand corruption, know-your-customer\nrequirements, anti-money laundering,\nembargo programs and economic sanctions.\nFor example, we are subject to the U.S.\nBank Secrecy Act (BSA), which contains\nanti-money laundering and financial\ntransparency laws designed to detect and\ndeter money laundering and the financing\nof terrorism, as well as record-keeping,\nreporting, due diligence and customer\nverification requirements, various\nsanctions programs administered and\nenforced by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) and foreign\njurisdictions, which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in\ncountries that are, involved in\nactivities, such as terrorism,\nhostilities, drug trafficking or human\nrights violations and the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the\nU.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt\nand illegal payments to government\nofficials and others.\n                                                                                  \n  Source of Strength                                                              \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Financial Reform Act and\nFederal Reserve policy, BHCs are\nexpected to act as a source of financial\nstrength to\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America4                                                                \n                                                                                  \neach subsidiary bank and to commit\nresources to support each such\nsubsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-\nguarantee provisions of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the\nevent of a loss suffered or anticipated\nby the FDIC, either as a result of\ndefault of a bank subsidiary or related\nto FDIC assistance provided to such a\nsubsidiary in danger of default, the\naffiliate banks of such a subsidiary may\nbe assessed for the FDIC\u2019s loss, subject\nto certain exceptions.\n                                                                                  \n  Transactions with Affiliates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act, as implemented by\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the\nBanks are subject to restrictions that\nlimit certain types of transactions\nbetween the Banks and their nonbank\naffiliates. In general, U.S. banks are\nsubject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit,\npurchases of assets and certain other\ntransactions involving their nonbank\naffiliates. Additionally, transactions\nbetween U.S. banks and their nonbank\naffiliates are required to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                                                                  \n  Deposit Insurance                                                               \n                                                                                  \nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks\nare insured by the FDIC, subject to\nlimits and conditions of applicable law\nand the FDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant to\nthe Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance\ncoverage limits are $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank for each\naccount ownership category. All insured\ndepository institutions are required to\npay assessments to the FDIC in order to\nfund the DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain a\nstatutory minimum ratio of the DIF to\ninsured deposits in the U.S. of at least\n1.35 percent and has established a long-\nterm goal of a two percent DIF ratio. As\nof the date of this report, the DIF is\nbelow the statutory minimum ratio and\nthe FDIC\u2019s long-term goal. In October\n2022, the FDIC adopted a restoration\nplan that includes an increase in\ndeposit insurance assessments across the\nindustry of two basis points (bps). The\nFDIC has indicated that it intends to\nmaintain such assessment rates for the\nforeseeable future. Deposit insurance\nassessment rates are subject to change\nby the FDIC and will be impacted by the\noverall economy and the stability of the\nbanking industry as a whole. The FDIC\nalso has the authority to charge special\nassessments from time to time, including\nin connection with systemic risk events.\nFor example, on November 16, 2023, the\nFDIC issued its final rule to impose a\nspecial assessment to recover the loss\nto the DIF resulting from the closure of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nFor more information on the impact to\nthe Corporation of the FDIC special\nassessment, see Executive Summary \u2013\nRecent Developments in the MD&A on page\n26.

These rules are\ncomplex and are evolving as U.S. and\ninternational regulatory authorities\npropose and enact amendments to these\nrules. The Corporation seeks to manage\nits capital position to maintain\nsufficient capital to satisfy these\nregulatory rules and to support our\nbusiness activities. These continually\nevolving rules are likely to influence\nour planning processes and may require\nadditional regulatory capital and\nliquidity, as well as impose additional\noperational and compliance costs on the\nCorporation.\n\nFor more information on regulatory\ncapital rules, capital composition and\npending or proposed regulatory capital\nchanges, see Capital Management on page\n47 and Note 16 \u2013 Regulatory Requirements\nand Restrictions to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, which are\nincorporated by reference in this Item\n1.\n                                                                                  \n  Distributions                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to various regulatory\npolicies and requirements relating to\ncapital actions, including payment of\ndividends and common stock repurchases.\nFor instance, Federal Reserve\nregulations require major U.S. BHCs to\nsubmit a capital plan as part of an\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR).\n\nOur ability to pay dividends and make\ncommon stock repurchases depends in part\non our ability to maintain regulatory\ncapital levels above minimum\nrequirements plus buffers and non-\ncapital standards established under the\nFDICIA. To the extent that the Federal\nReserve increases our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB), global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge or\ncountercyclical capital buffer, our\nreturns of capital to shareholders,\nincluding dividends and common stock\nrepurchases, could decrease. As part of\nits CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts\nstress testing on parts of our business\nusing hypothetical economic scenarios\nprepared by the Federal Reserve. Those\nscenarios may affect our CCAR stress\ntest results, which may impact the level\nof our SCB. For example, based on the\nresults of our 2023 CCAR stress test,\nthe Corporation\u2019s SCB decreased to 2.5\npercent. Additionally, the Corporation\u2019s\nG-SIB surcharge increased to 3.0 percent\non January 1, 2024. The Federal Reserve\ncould also impose limitations or\nprohibitions on taking capital actions\nsuch as paying or increasing dividends\nor repurchasing common stock. For\nexample, as a result of the economic\nuncertainty resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, in the second half of 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve introduced certain\nlimitations to capital distributions for\nall large banks, including the\nCorporation, which were removed\neffective July 1, 2021.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of\nour Banks are not \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or\n\u201cwell-managed,\u201d we would be required to\nenter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve to comply with all applicable\ncapital and management requirements,\nwhich may contain additional limitations\nor conditions relating to our\nactivities. Additionally, the applicable\nfederal regulatory authority is\nauthorized to determine, under certain\ncircumstances relating to the financial\ncondition of a bank or BHC, that the\npayment of dividends would be an unsafe\nor unsound practice and to prohibit\npayment thereof.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. The\nrights of the Corporation, our\nshareholders and our creditors to\nparticipate in any distribution of the\nassets or earnings of our subsidiaries\nare further subject to the prior claims\nof creditors of the respective\nsubsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding\ndistributions, including the minimum\ncapital requirements, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity and Note 16 \u2013\nRegulatory Requirements and Restrictions\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                                  \n  5Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Resolution Planning                                                             \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion\nof assets, the Corporation is required\nby the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to\nperiodically submit a plan for a rapid\nand orderly resolution in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure.\n\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a\ndetailed roadmap for the orderly\nresolution of the BHC, including the\ncontinued operations or solvent wind\ndown of its material entities, pursuant\nto the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or\nmore hypothetical scenarios assuming no\nextraordinary government assistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\ndetermine that the BHC\u2019s plan is not\ncredible, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC may jointly impose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on growth,\nactivities or operations. A summary of\nour plan is available on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of\na resolution plan for Bank of America,\nNational Association, which must\ndescribe how the insured depository\ninstitution would be resolved under the\nbank resolution provisions of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. A\ndescription of this plan is available on\nthe FDIC\u2019s website.\n\nWe continue to make substantial progress\nto enhance our resolvability, which\nincludes continued improvements to our\npreparedness capabilities to implement\nour resolution plan, both from a\nfinancial and operational standpoint.\n\nAcross international jurisdictions,\nresolution planning is the\nresponsibility of national resolution\nauthorities (RA) and central resolution\nauthorities (CA). Among those, the\njurisdictions with the greatest impact\nto the Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries are\nthe U.K., Ireland and France, where\nrules have been issued requiring the\nsubmission of significant information\nabout locally incorporated subsidiaries\nas well as the Corporation\u2019s banking\nbranches located in those jurisdictions\nthat are deemed to be material for\nresolution planning purposes. As a\nresult of the RA\u2019s and CA's review of\nthe submitted information, we could be\nrequired to take certain actions over\nthe next several years that could\nincrease operating costs and potentially\nresult in the restructuring of certain\nbusinesses and subsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Liquidity on page 9.\n                                                                                  \n  Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority                                \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nthe FDIC may be appointed receiver of an\ninsured depository institution if it is\ninsolvent or in certain other\ncircumstances. In addition, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nsystemically important financial\ninstitution (SIFI) such as the\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such institution. In the\nevent of such appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things, invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, instead\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury makes certain\nfinancial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. The orderly liquidation\nauthority is modeled in part on the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, but also\nadopts certain concepts from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority\ncontains certain differences from the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in\ncertain circumstances, the FDIC could\npermit payment of obligations it\ndetermines to be systemically\nsignificant (e.g., short-term creditors\nor operating creditors) in lieu of\npaying other obligations (e.g., long-\nterm creditors) without the need to\nobtain creditors\u2019 consent or prior court\nreview. The insolvency and resolution\nprocess could also lead to a large\nreduction or total\n\nelimination of the value of a BHC\u2019s\noutstanding equity, as well as\nimpairment or elimination of certain\ndebt.\n\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC\ncould replace a distressed BHC with a\nbridge holding company, which could\ncontinue operations and result in an\norderly resolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity is held solely\nfor the benefit of creditors of the\noriginal BHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve\nrequires that BHCs maintain minimum\nlevels of long-term debt required to\nprovide adequate loss absorbing capacity\nin the event of a resolution.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution, see Item 1A.

At June 30, 2023, we held greater\nthan 10 percent of the total amount of\ndeposits of insured depository\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act\nrestricts acquisitions by a financial\ninstitution if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial institution would exceed\n10 percent of the total liabilities of\nall financial institutions in the U.S.\nAt June 30, 2023, our liabilities did\nnot exceed 10 percent of the total\nliabilities of all financial\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n                                                                                  \n  The Volcker Rule                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured\ndepository institutions and companies\naffiliated with insured depository\ninstitutions (collectively, banking\nentities) from engaging in short-term\nproprietary trading of certain\nsecurities, derivatives, commodity\nfutures and options for their own\naccount. The Volcker Rule also imposes\nlimits on banking entities\u2019 investments\nin, and other relationships with, hedge\nfunds and private equity funds. The\nVolcker Rule provides exemptions for\ncertain activities, including market\nmaking, underwriting, hedging, trading\nin government obligations, insurance\ncompany activities and organizing and\noffering hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies\nthat certain activities are not\nprohibited, including acting as agent,\nbroker or custodian. A banking entity\nwith significant trading operations,\nsuch as the Corporation, is required to\nmaintain a detailed compliance program\nto comply with the restrictions of the\nVolcker Rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivatives                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nOur derivatives businesses are subject\nto extensive regulation globally,\nincluding under the Financial Reform\nAct, the European Union (EU) Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive and\nRegulation, the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation, analogous\nU.K. regulatory regimes and similar\nregulatory regimes in other\njurisdictions. These regulations, among\nother things, require clearing and\nexchange trading of certain derivatives,\nestablish capital, margin, reporting,\nregistration and business conduct\nrequirements for certain market\nparticipants, set position limits on\ncertain derivatives and set out\nderivatives trading transparency\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions,\nincluding the U.S., EU, U.K., and Japan,\nhave adopted resolution stay regulations\nto address concerns that the close-out\nof derivatives and other\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America6                                                                \n                                                                                  \nfinancial contracts could impede orderly\nresolution of G-SIBs, and additional\njurisdictions are expected to follow\nsuit. Generally, these regulations\nrequire amendment of certain financial\ncontracts to provide for contractual\nrecognition of stays of termination\nrights under various statutory\nresolution regimes and a stay on the\nexercise of cross-default rights based\non an affiliate\u2019s entry into insolvency\nproceedings. Resolution regulations may\nalso require contractual recognition by\nthe counterparty that amounts owed to\nthem may be written down or converted\ninto equity as part of a bail in.

Risk FactorsThe discussion below addresses our material risk        \u2502\n\u2502  factors of which we are aware. Any risk factor, either by itself or together  \u2502\n\u2502  with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our            \u2502\n\u2502  businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.     \u2502\n\u2502  References to third parties may include suppliers, service providers,         \u2502\n\u2502  counterparties, financial market utilities, exchanges and clearing houses,    \u2502\n\u2502  data aggregators and other partners and their upstream and downstream         \u2502\n\u2502  service providers (e.g., fourth parties, fifth parties) who may also          \u2502\n\u2502  contribute to our risks. Other factors not currently known to us or that we   \u2502\n\u2502  currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses,         \u2502\n\u2502  results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Therefore, the  \u2502\n\u2502  risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that   \u2502\n\u2502  we may face. For more information on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk   \u2502\n\u2502  in the MD&A beginning on page 44. For more information about the risks        \u2502\n\u2502  contained in this section, see Item 1. Business beginning on page 2, MD&A     \u2502\n\u2502  beginning on page 25 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements           \u2502\n\u2502  beginning on page 94.MarketWe may be adversely affected by the financial      \u2502\n\u2502  markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic              \u2502\n\u2502  conditions.General economic, political, social and health conditions in the   \u2502\n\u2502  U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our business. In particular,     \u2502\n\u2502  global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest        \u2502\n\u2502  rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross      \u2502\n\u2502  domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation,     \u2502\n\u2502  supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor         \u2502\n\u2502  shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal      \u2502\n\u2502  government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property         \u2502\n\u2502  values, bankruptcies and a default by a significant market participant or     \u2502\n\u2502  class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets. Global      \u2502\n\u2502  markets also may be affected by adverse developments impacting the U.S. or    \u2502\n\u2502  global banking industry, including bank failures and liquidity concerns,      \u2502\n\u2502  fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital     \u2502\n\u2502  markets and currencies, the transition of benchmark rates, including the      \u2502\n\u2502  Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), to alternative reference rates  \u2502\n\u2502  (ARRs), the impact of the volatility of digital assets on the broader         \u2502\n\u2502  market, the rate of growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the  \u2502\n\u2502  availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication,     \u2502\n\u2502  transportation or energy infrastructure, recessionary fears, investor         \u2502\n\u2502  sentiment and the U.S. and global election cycles, including resulting        \u2502\n\u2502  changes to policy and the geopolitical environment. Global markets,           \u2502\n\u2502  including energy and commodity markets, may also be adversely affected by     \u2502\n\u2502  the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic     \u2502\n\u2502  extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation    \u2502\n\u2502  of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military         \u2502\n\u2502  conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may    \u2502\n\u2502  impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. Any sudden or        \u2502\n\u2502  prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise,     \u2502\n\u2502  could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and   \u2502\n\u2502  adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition,           \u2502\n\u2502  including capital and liquidity levels. Elevated inflation and interest rate  \u2502\n\u2502  levels, monetary tightening by central banks, and geopolitical developments,  \u2502\n\u2502  including the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict in the Middle East,    \u2502\n\u2502  have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact                  \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in            \u2502\n\u2502  additional market volatility and disruptions.Global uncertainties regarding   \u2502\n\u2502  fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. Actions taken by    \u2502\n\u2502  the Federal Reserve or central banks in other jurisdictions, including        \u2502\n\u2502  changes in target rates, balance sheet management and lending facilities,     \u2502\n\u2502  are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly in an elevated  \u2502\n\u2502  inflation environment. This can affect interest rates and the value of        \u2502\n\u2502  financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities, and impact   \u2502\n\u2502  our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise   \u2502\n\u2502  government debt levels, adversely affect businesses and household incomes,    \u2502\n\u2502  adversely impact the banking sector generally, and increase uncertainty       \u2502\n\u2502  surrounding monetary policy. Monetary policy in response to high inflation    \u2502\n\u2502  has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening   \u2502\n\u2502  and/or inversion of the yield curve. This has resulted in and may continue    \u2502\n\u2502  to result in volatility of equity and other markets, further volatility of    \u2502\n\u2502  the U.S. dollar, a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and   \u2502\n\u2502  recessionary concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which       \u2502\n\u2502  could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially            \u2502\n\u2502  increasing delinquency rates. Financial market volatility could also result   \u2502\n\u2502  from uncertainty about the timing and extent of rate cuts by the Federal      \u2502\n\u2502  Reserve in response to moderating inflation and/or weakening economic         \u2502\n\u2502  conditions. Elevated inflation may limit the scope of monetary support,       \u2502\n\u2502  including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of an economic         \u2502\n\u2502  downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted     \u2502\n\u2502  yield curve.Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in   \u2502\n\u2502  an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest  \u2502\n\u2502  rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest         \u2502\n\u2502  income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.               \u2502\n\u2502  Additionally, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and       \u2502\n\u2502  evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation,         \u2502\n\u2502  taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including       \u2502\n\u2502  efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely  \u2502\n\u2502  impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', our               \u2502\n\u2502  counterparties' and our earnings and operations. Globally, many central       \u2502\n\u2502  banks have simultaneously reduced monetary accommodation through interest     \u2502\n\u2502  rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to       \u2502\n\u2502  contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and            \u2502\n\u2502  significant changes to asset values. While higher interest rates have         \u2502\n\u2502  positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have       \u2502\n\u2502  negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment        \u2502\n\u2502  securities, deposits, loan demand and funding costs. In addition to higher    \u2502\n\u2502  interest rates, wider credit spreads can negatively impact capital by         \u2502\n\u2502  reducing the value of debt securities. High and rising federal debt levels    \u2502\n\u2502  and uncertainty about the U.S. budget process could lead to higher interest   \u2502\n\u2502  rates and financial market volatility, potentially impacting broader          \u2502\n\u2502  economic activity. Further, if the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling limit is    \u2502\n\u2502  not raised in January 2025, the ramifications could result in market          \u2502\n\u2502  volatility, ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to           \u2502\n\u2502  recessionary conditions. This could have a negative and potentially severe    \u2502\n\u2502  impact on the U.S. and world economy and financial and capital markets,       \u2502\n\u2502  including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values,       \u2502\n\u2502  lower liquidity, downgrades to U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.Changes  \u2502\n\u2502  to international trade and investment policies by the U.S. could negatively   \u2502\n\u2502  impact financial markets. Escalation of tensions between the U.S. and the     \u2502\n\u2502  People\u2019s Republic of China                                                    \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America8                                                                \n                                                                                  \n(China) could lead to further U.S.\nmeasures that adversely affect financial\nmarkets, disrupt world trade and\ncommerce and lead to trade retaliation,\nincluding through the use of tariffs,\nforeign exchange measures or the large-\nscale sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Any\nrestrictions on the activities of\nbusinesses, could also negatively affect\nfinancial markets.\n\nThese developments could adversely\naffect our businesses, customers,\nsecurities and derivatives portfolios,\nincluding the risk of lower re-\ninvestment rates within those\nportfolios, our level of charge-offs and\nprovision for credit losses, the\ncarrying value of our deferred tax\nassets, our capital levels, our\nliquidity and our results of operations.\n\nIncreased market volatility and adverse\nchanges in financial or capital market\nconditions may increase our market risk.\n\nOur liquidity, competitive position,\nbusiness, results of operations and\nfinancial condition are affected by\nmarket risks such as changes in interest\nand currency exchange rates,\nfluctuations in equity, commodity and\nfutures prices, trading volumes and\nprices of securitized products, the\nimplied volatility of interest rates and\ncredit spreads and other economic and\nbusiness factors. These market risks may\nadversely affect, among other things,\nthe value of our securities, including\nour on- and off-balance sheet\nsecurities, trading assets and other\nfinancial instruments, the cost of debt\ncapital and our access to credit\nmarkets, the value of assets under\nmanagement (AUM), fee income relating to\nAUM, customer allocation of capital\namong investment alternatives, the\nvolume of client activity in our trading\noperations, investment banking,\nunderwriting and other capital market\nfees, which have already been negatively\nimpacted, the general profitability and\nrisk level of the transactions in which\nwe engage and our competitiveness with\nrespect to deposit pricing. The value of\ncertain of our assets is sensitive to\nchanges in market interest rates. If the\nFederal Reserve or a non-U.S. central\nbank changes or signals a change in\nmonetary policy, market interest rates\nor credit spreads could be affected,\nwhich could adversely impact the value\nof such assets. Changes to fiscal\npolicy, including expansion of U.S.\nfederal deficit spending and resultant\ndebt issuance, could also affect market\ninterest rates. If interest rates\ndecrease, our results of operations\ncould be negatively impacted, including\nfuture revenue and earnings growth.\n\nOur models and strategies to assess and\ncontrol our market risk exposures are\nsubject to inherent limitations. In\ntimes of market stress or other\nunforeseen circumstances, previously\nuncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Such changes to the\nrelationship between market parameters\nmay limit the effectiveness of our\nhedging strategies and cause us to incur\nsignificant losses. Changes in\ncorrelation can be exacerbated where\nmarket participants use risk or trading\nmodels with assumptions or algorithms\nsimilar to ours. In these and other\ncases, it may be difficult to reduce our\nrisk positions due to activity of other\nmarket participants or widespread market\ndislocations, including circumstances\nwhere asset values are declining\nsignificantly or no market exists. Where\nwe own securities that do not have an\nestablished liquid trading market or are\notherwise subject to restrictions on\nsale or hedging, or where the degree of\naccessible liquidity declines\nsignificantly, we may not be able to\nreduce our positions and risks\nassociated with such holdings, so we may\nsuffer larger than expected losses when\nadverse price movements take place. This\nrisk can be exacerbated where we hold a\nposition that is large relative to the\navailable liquidity.\n\nIf asset values decline, we may incur\nlosses and negative impacts to capital\nand liquidity requirements.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of financial\ninstruments, including loans and loan\ncommitments, securities financing\nagreements, asset-backed secured\nfinancings, derivative assets and\nliabilities, debt securities, marketable\nequity securities and certain other\nassets and liabilities that we measure\nat fair value and are subject to\nvaluation and impairment assessments. We\ndetermine these values based on\napplicable accounting guidance, which,\nfor financial instruments measured at\nfair value, requires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price and to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs\nin fair value measurements. The fair\nvalues of these financial instruments\ninclude adjustments for market\nliquidity, credit quality, funding\nimpact on certain derivatives and other\ntransaction-specific factors, where\nappropriate.\n\nGains or losses on these instruments can\nhave a direct impact on our results of\noperations, unless we have effectively\nmitigated the risk of our exposures.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause\ndecreases in residential mortgage loan\noriginations and could impact the\norigination of corporate debt. In\naddition, increases in interest rates or\nchanges in spreads may continue to\nadversely impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities and, accordingly, for\ndebt securities classified as available-\nfor-sale (AFS), adversely affect\naccumulated other comprehensive income\nand, thus, our capital levels. Increases\nin interest rates could also adversely\nimpact our regulatory liquidity position\nand requirements, which include certain\nAFS debt securities and the use of\nrepurchase agreements against a portion\nof the held-to-maturity (HTM) debt\nsecurities. As our liquidity is\ndependent on the fair value of these\nassets, increases in market interest\nrates, which have adversely impacted and\nmay continue to adversely impact the\nfair value of debt securities, could\nadversely affect liquidity levels.\n\nFair values may be impacted by declining\nvalues of the underlying assets or the\nprices at which observable market\ntransactions occur and the continued\navailability of these transactions or\nindices. The financial strength of\ncounterparties, with whom we have\neconomically hedged some of our exposure\nto these assets, also will affect the\nfair value of these assets. Sudden\ndeclines and volatility in the prices of\nassets may curtail or eliminate trading\nactivities in these assets, which may\nmake it difficult to sell, hedge or\nvalue these assets. The inability to\nsell or effectively hedge assets reduces\nour ability to limit losses in such\npositions, and the difficulty in valuing\nassets may increase our risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), which requires us to\nmaintain additional capital and\nincreases our funding costs. Values of\nAUM also impact revenues in our wealth\nmanagement and related advisory\nbusinesses for asset-based management\nand performance fees. Declines in values\nof AUM can result in lower fees earned\nfor managing such assets.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nIf we are unable to access the capital\nmarkets, have prolonged net deposits\noutflows, or our borrowing costs\nincrease, our liquidity and competitive\nposition will be negatively affected.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our\nbusinesses. We fund our assets primarily\nwith globally sourced deposits in our\nbank entities, as well as secured and\nunsecured liabilities transacted in the\ncapital markets. We rely on certain\nsecured funding sources, such as repo\nmarkets, which are typically short-term\nand credit-sensitive. We also engage in\nasset securitization transactions,\nincluding with the government-sponsored\nenterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer\nlending activities. Our liquidity could\nbe adversely affected by any inability\nto access the capital markets,\nilliquidity or volatility in the capital\nmarkets, the decrease in value of\neligible collateral or increased\ncollateral requirements (including as a\nresult of credit concerns for short-term\n                                                                                  \n  9Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nborrowing), changes to our relationships\nwith our funding providers based on real\nor perceived changes in our risk\nprofile, prolonged federal government\nshutdowns, or changes in regulations,\nguidance or GSE status that impact our\nfunding.\n\nAdditionally, our liquidity or cost of\nfunds may be negatively impacted by the\nunwillingness or inability of the\nFederal Reserve to act as lender of last\nresort, unexpected simultaneous draws on\nlines of credit or deposits, slower\ncustomer payment rates, restricted\naccess to the assets of prime brokerage\nclients, the withdrawal of or failure to\nattract customer deposits or invested\nfunds (which could result from attrition\ndriven by customers seeking higher\nyielding deposits or securities\nproducts, customer desire to utilize an\nalternative financial institution\nperceived to be safer, changes in\ncustomer spending behavior due to\ninflation, decline in the economy or\nother drivers resulting in an increased\nneed for cash), increased regulatory\nliquidity, capital and margin\nrequirements for our U.S. or\ninternational banks and their nonbank\nsubsidiaries, which could result in the\ninability to transfer liquidity\ninternally and inefficient funding,\nchanges in patterns of intraday\nliquidity usage resulting from a\ncounterparty or technology failure or\nother idiosyncratic event or failure or\ndefault by a significant market\nparticipant or third party (including\nclearing agents, custodians, central\nbanks or central counterparty\nclearinghouses (CCPs)). These factors\nmay increase our borrowing costs and\nnegatively impact our liquidity.\n\nSeveral of these factors may arise due\nto circumstances beyond our control,\nsuch as general market volatility,\ndisruption, shock or stress, the\nemergence or continuation of widespread\nhealth emergencies or pandemics, and\nmilitary conflicts (including the\nRussia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict\nin the Middle East). Federal Reserve\npolicy decisions (including fluctuations\nin interest rates or Federal Reserve\nbalance sheet composition), negative\nviews or loss of confidence about us or\nthe financial services industry\ngenerally or due to a specific news\nevent, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment or governmental fiscal or\nmonetary policies, actions by credit\nrating agencies or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties or\nus. The impact of these potentially\nsudden events, whether within our\ncontrol or not, could include an\ninability to sell assets or redeem\ninvestments, unforeseen outflows of\ncash, the need to draw on liquidity\nfacilities, the reduction of financing\nbalances and the loss of equity secured\nfunding, debt repurchases to support the\nsecondary market or meet client\nrequests, the need for additional\nfunding for commitments and\ncontingencies and unexpected collateral\ncalls, among other things, the result of\nwhich could be increased costs, a\nliquidity shortfall and/or impact on our\nliquidity coverage ratio.\n\nOur liquidity and cost of obtaining\nfunding may be directly related to\ninvestor behavior and confidence, debt\nmarket disruption, firm specific\nconcerns or prevailing market\nconditions, including changes in\ninterest and currency exchange rates,\nsignificant fluctuations in equity and\nfutures prices, lower trading volumes\nand prices of securitized products and\nour credit spreads. Increases in\ninterest rates and our credit spreads\ncan increase the cost of our funding and\nresult in mark-to-market or credit\nvaluation adjustment exposures. Changes\nin our credit spreads are market driven\nand may be influenced by market\nperceptions of our creditworthiness,\nincluding changes in our credit ratings\nor changes in broader financial market\nand macroeconomic conditions. Changes to\ninterest rates and our credit spreads\noccur continuously and may be\nunpredictable and highly volatile. We\nmay also experience net interest margin\ncompression as a result of offering\nhigher than expected deposit rates in\norder to attract and maintain deposits.\nConcentrations within our funding\nprofile, such as maturities,\n\ncurrencies or counterparties, can also\nreduce our funding efficiency.\n\nReduction in our credit ratings could\nlimit our access to funding or the\ncapital markets, increase borrowing\ncosts or trigger additional collateral\nor funding requirements.\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise\nfunds are directly impacted by our\ncredit ratings. Credit ratings are also\nimportant to investors, customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and seek to engage in\ncertain transactions, including over-\nthe-counter (OTC) derivatives. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by rating agencies, which\nconsider a number of financial and\nnonfinancial factors, including our\nfranchise, financial strength,\nperformance and prospects, management,\ngovernance, risk management practices,\ncapital adequacy, asset quality and\noperations, among other criteria, as\nwell as factors not under our control,\nsuch as regulatory developments, the\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment and changes to the\nmethodologies used to determine our\nratings.\n\nRating agencies could adjust our credit\nratings at any time and there can be no\nassurance as to whether or when a\ndowngrade could occur. Any reduction\ncould result in a wider credit spread\nand negatively affect our access to\ncredit markets, the related cost of\nfunds, our businesses and certain\ntrading revenues, particularly in those\nbusinesses where counterparty\ncreditworthiness is critical. If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our parent\ncompany, bank or broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were downgraded, we may\nexperience loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing,\nand/or incur increased cost of funds and\nincreased collateral requirements. Under\nthe terms of certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements,\nif our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings are downgraded, the\ncounterparties may require additional\ncollateral or terminate these contracts\nor agreements.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nconsequences of a credit rating\ndowngrade are inherently uncertain and\ndepend upon numerous dynamic, complex\nand inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including the relationship\nbetween long-term and short-term credit\nratings and the behaviors of customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.\n\nBank of America Corporation is a holding\ncompany, is dependent on its\nsubsidiaries for liquidity and may be\nrestricted from transferring funds from\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America Corporation, as the\nparent company, is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and\nmanage liquidity on a legal entity\nbasis. Legal entity liquidity is an\nimportant consideration as there are\nlegal, regulatory, contractual and other\nlimitations on our ability to utilize\nliquidity from one legal entity to\nsatisfy the liquidity requirements of\nanother, including the parent company,\nwhich could result in adverse liquidity\nevents. The parent company depends on\ndividends, distributions, loans and\nother payments from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries to fund dividend payments\non our preferred stock and common stock\nand to fund all payments on our other\nobligations, including debt obligations.\nAny inability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds, pay dividends or make\npayments to us may adversely affect our\ncash flow, liquidity and financial\ncondition.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. Our bank\nand broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to restrictions on their ability\nto lend or transact with affiliates,\nminimum regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America10                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand restrictions on their ability to use\nfunds deposited with them in bank or\nbrokerage accounts to fund their\nbusinesses. Intercompany arrangements we\nentered into in connection with our\nresolution planning submissions could\nrestrict the amount of funding available\nto the parent company from our\nsubsidiaries under certain adverse\nconditions.\n\nAdditional restrictions on related party\ntransactions, increased capital and\nliquidity requirements and additional\nlimitations on the use of funds on\ndeposit in bank or brokerage accounts,\nas well as lower earnings, can reduce\nthe amount of funds available to meet\nthe obligations of the parent company\nand even require the parent company to\nprovide additional funding to such\nsubsidiaries. Also, regulatory action\nthat requires additional liquidity at\neach of our subsidiaries could impede\naccess to funds we need to pay our\nobligations or pay dividends. In\naddition, our right to participate in a\ndistribution of assets upon a\nsubsidiary\u2019s liquidation or\nreorganization is subject to prior\nclaims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\nBank of America Corporation\u2019s liquidity\nand financial condition, and the ability\nto pay dividends and obligations, could\nbe adversely affected in the event of a\nresolution.\n\nBank of America Corporation, our parent\nholding company, is required to\nperiodically submit a plan to the FDIC\nand Federal Reserve describing its\nresolution strategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. Bank of\nAmerica Corporation\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy is a \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy, whereby only the\nparent holding company would file for\nbankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. Certain key operating subsidiaries\nwould be provided with sufficient\ncapital and liquidity to operate through\nsevere stress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue operating or be\nwound down in a solvent manner following\na bankruptcy of the parent holding\ncompany. Bank of America Corporation has\nentered into intercompany arrangements\nresulting in the contribution of most of\nits capital and liquidity to key\nsubsidiaries. Pursuant to these\narrangements, if Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nbecomes imminent, it will no longer be\nable to draw liquidity from its key\nsubsidiaries and will be required to\ncontribute its remaining financial\nassets to a wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary. This could adversely affect\nour liquidity and financial condition,\nincluding the ability to meet our\npayment obligations and the ability to\nreturn capital to shareholders,\nincluding through the payment of\ndividends and repurchase of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock.\n\nIf the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly\ndetermine that Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s resolution plan is not\ncredible, they could impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or operations. We\ncould also be required to take certain\nactions that could impose operating\ncosts and result in the divestiture of\nassets or restructuring of businesses\nand subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a G-SIB such as Bank of America\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver to conduct an orderly\nliquidation, and could, among other\nthings, invoke the orderly liquidation\nauthority, instead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the\nTreasury makes certain financial\ndistress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. Additionally, the FDIC\ncould replace Bank of America\nCorporation with a bridge holding\ncompany, which could continue operations\nand result in an orderly resolution of\nthe underlying bank, but whose equity\nwould be held solely for the benefit of\nour creditors. The FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy may result in our\nsecurity holders suffering greater\nlosses than would have been the case\nunder a bankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution strategy.\n\nIf the Corporation is resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC\u2019s\norderly liquidation authority, third-\nparty creditors of our subsidiaries may\nreceive significant or full recoveries\non their claims, while security holders\nof Bank of America Corporation could\nface significant or complete losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nEconomic or market disruptions and\ninsufficient credit loss reserves may\nresult in a higher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nA number of our products expose us to\ncredit risk, including loans, letters of\ncredit, derivatives, debt securities,\ntrading account assets and assets held-\nfor-sale. Deterioration in the financial\ncondition of our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral could adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nOur credit portfolios may be impacted by\nU.S. and global macroeconomic and market\nconditions, events and disruptions,\nincluding declines in GDP, consumer\nspending or property values, asset price\ncorrections, increasing consumer and\ncorporate leverage, increases in\ncorporate bond spreads, government\nshutdowns or policies such as student\nloan debt payment resumptions, tax\nchanges, rising or elevated unemployment\nlevels, elevated inflation, fluctuations\nin foreign exchange or interest rates,\nas well as the emergence or continuation\nof widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, extreme weather events and\nthe impacts of climate change, including\nacute and/or chronic extreme weather\nevents and efforts to transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. Significant economic\nor market stresses and disruptions\ntypically have a negative impact on the\nbusiness environment and financial\nmarkets, which could impact the\nunderlying credit quality of our\nborrowers, counterparties and assets.\nProperty value declines or asset price\ncorrections could increase the risk of\nborrowers or counterparties defaulting\nor becoming delinquent in their\nobligations to us, and could decrease\nthe value of the collateral we hold,\nwhich could increase credit losses.\nCredit risk could also be magnified by\nlending to leveraged borrowers or\ndeclining asset prices, including\nproperty or collateral values, unrelated\nto macroeconomic stress. Simultaneous\ndrawdowns on lines of credit and/or an\nincrease in a borrower\u2019s leverage in a\nweakening economic environment, or\notherwise, could result in deterioration\nin our credit portfolio, should\nborrowers be unable to fulfill competing\nfinancial obligations. Increased\ndelinquency and default rates could\nadversely affect our credit portfolios,\nincluding consumer credit card, home\nequity and residential mortgage\nportfolios through increased charge-offs\nand provisions for credit losses.\n\nA recessionary environment and/or a rise\nin unemployment could adversely impact\nthe ability of our consumer and/or\ncommercial borrowers or counterparties\nto meet their financial obligations and\nnegatively impact our credit portfolio.\nConsumers have been and may continue to\nbe negatively impacted by inflation,\nresulting in drawdowns of savings or\nincreases in household debt. Higher\ninterest rates, which have increased\ndebt servicing costs for some businesses\nand households, may adversely impact\ncredit quality, particularly in a\nrecessionary environment. Certain\nsectors also remain at risk (e.g.,\ncommercial real estate, particularly\noffice) as a result of shifts in demand\nand tighter financial and credit\nconditions. Globally, conditions of slow\ngrowth or recession could further\ncontribute to weaker credit conditions.\nIf the macroeconomic environment or\ncertain sectors worsen, our credit\nportfolio, net charge-offs, provision\nand allowance for credit losses could be\nadversely impacted.\n                                                                                  \n  11Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe establish an allowance for credit\nlosses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments, based\non management's best estimate of\nlifetime expected credit losses (ECL)\ninherent in our relevant financial\nassets. The process to determine the\nallowance for credit losses uses models\nand assumptions that require us to make\ndifficult and complex judgments that are\noften interrelated, including\nforecasting how borrowers or\ncounterparties may perform in changing\neconomic conditions. The ability of our\nborrowers or counterparties to repay\ntheir obligations may be impacted by\nchanges in future economic conditions,\nwhich in turn could impact the accuracy\nof our loss forecasts and allowance\nestimates. There is also the possibility\nthat we have failed or will fail to\naccurately identify the appropriate\neconomic indicators or accurately\nestimate their impacts to our borrowers\nor counterparties, which could impact\nthe accuracy of our loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates.\n\nIf the models, estimates and assumptions\nwe use to establish reserves or the\njudgments we make in extending credit to\nour borrowers or counterparties, which\nare more sensitive due to the current\nuncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment, prove inaccurate in\npredicting future events, we may suffer\nlosses in excess of our ECL. In\naddition, changes to external factors\ncan negatively impact our recognition of\ncredit losses in our portfolios and\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is our\nbest estimate of ECL; however, there is\nno guarantee that it will be sufficient\nto address credit losses, particularly\nif the economic outlook deteriorates\nsignificantly, quickly, or unexpectedly.\nAs circumstances change, we may increase\nour allowance, which would reduce our\nearnings. If economic conditions worsen,\nimpacting our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral, and credit losses are worse\nthan expected, we may increase our\nprovision for credit losses, which could\nadversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nOur concentrations of credit risk could\nadversely affect our credit losses,\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nWe may be subject to concentrations of\ncredit risk because of a common\ncharacteristic or common sensitivity to\neconomic, financial, public health or\nbusiness developments. Concentrations of\ncredit risk may reside in a particular\nindustry, geography, product, asset\nclass, counterparty or within any pool\nof exposures with a common risk\ncharacteristic. A deterioration in the\nfinancial condition or prospects of a\nparticular industry, geographic\nlocation, product or asset class, or a\nfailure or downgrade of, or default by,\nany particular entity or group of\nentities could negatively affect our\nbusinesses, and it is possible our\nlimits and credit monitoring exposure\ncontrols will not function as\nanticipated.\n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions\nand have significant credit\nconcentrations with respect to the\nfinancial services industry,\npredominantly comprised of broker-\ndealers, commercial banks, investment\nbanks, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds, CCPs and other\ninstitutional clients. Financial\nservices institutions and other\ncounterparties are inter-related because\nof trading, funding, clearing or other\nrelationships. Defaults by one or more\ncounterparties, or market uncertainty\nabout the financial stability of one or\nmore financial services institutions, or\nthe financial services industry\ngenerally, could lead to market-wide\nliquidity disruptions, losses, defaults\nand related disputes and litigation.\n\nOur credit risk may also be heightened\nby market risk when the collateral held\nby us cannot be liquidated or is\nliquidated at prices not sufficient to\nrecover the full amount of the loan or\n\nderivatives exposure due to us, which\nmay occur as a result of events that\nimpact the value of the collateral, such\nas a sudden change in asset price or\nfraud. Disputes with obligors as to the\nvaluation of collateral could increase\nin times of significant market stress,\nvolatility or illiquidity, and we could\nsuffer losses during such periods if we\nare unable to realize the fair value of\nthe collateral or manage declines in the\nvalue of collateral.\n\nWe have concentrations of credit risk,\nincluding with respect to our consumer\nreal estate and consumer credit card\nexposure, as well as our commercial real\nestate and asset managers and funds\nportfolios, which represent a\nsignificant percentage of our overall\ncredit portfolio. Declining home price\nvaluations and demand where we have\nlarge concentrations could result in\nincreased servicing advances and\nexpenses, defaults, delinquencies or\ncredit losses. The impacts of\nearthquakes, as well as climate change,\nsuch as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and the\nincreasing frequency and severity of\nextreme weather events and natural\ndisasters, including droughts, floods,\nwildfires and hurricanes, could\nnegatively impact collateral, the\nvaluations of home or commercial real\nestate or our customers\u2019 ability and/or\nwillingness to pay fees, outstanding\nloans or afford new products. This could\nalso cause insurability risk and/or\nincreased insurance costs to customers.\n\nEconomic weaknesses, sustained elevated\ninflation, adverse business conditions,\nmarket disruptions, adverse economic or\nmarket events, rising interest or\ncapitalization rates, declining asset\nprices, greater volatility in areas\nwhere we have concentrated credit risk\nor deterioration in real estate values\nor household incomes may cause us to\nexperience higher credit losses in our\nportfolios or write down the value of\ncertain assets. We could also experience\ncontinued and long-term negative impacts\nto our commercial credit exposure and an\nincrease in credit losses within those\nindustries that may be permanently\nimpacted by a change in consumer\npreferences or other industry\ndisruptions.\n\nWe also enter into transactions with\nsovereign nations, U.S. states and\nmunicipalities. Unfavorable economic or\npolitical conditions, disruptions to\ncapital markets, currency fluctuations,\nchanges in oil prices, social\ninstability and changes in government or\nmonetary policies could adversely impact\nthe operating budgets or credit ratings\nof these government entities and expose\nus to credit and liquidity risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may result in our inability to\nsell, syndicate or realize the value of\nour positions, increasing\nconcentrations, which could increase RWA\nand the credit and market risk\nassociated with our positions.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by\nweaknesses in the U.S. housing market.\n\nDuring 2023, the U.S. housing market\ncontinued to be impacted by higher\nmortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-\nrate mortgages that more than doubled\nfrom 2021. This has negatively impacted\nthe demand in some cases and underlying\ncollateral for many of our products.\nAdditionally, our mortgage loan\nproduction volume is generally\ninfluenced by the rate of growth in\nresidential mortgage debt outstanding\nand the size of the residential mortgage\nmarket, both of which have slowed due to\nhigher interest rates and reduced\naffordability. A deeper downturn in the\ncondition of the U.S. housing market\ncould result in significant write-downs\nof asset values in several asset\nclasses, notably mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS). If the U.S. housing\nmarket were to further weaken, the value\nof real estate could decline, which\ncould result in increased credit losses\nand delinquent servicing expenses,\nnegatively affect our\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America12                                                               \n                                                                                  \nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, and adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nOur derivatives businesses may expose us\nto unexpected risks, which may result in\nlosses and adversely affect liquidity.\n\nWe are party to a large number of\nderivatives transactions that may expose\nus to unexpected market, credit and\noperational risks that could cause us to\nsuffer unexpected losses. Fluctuations\nin asset values or rates or an\nunanticipated credit event, including\nunforeseen circumstances that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to\nbecome correlated, may lead to losses\nresulting from risks not taken into\naccount or anticipated in the\ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a\nderivative instrument. Certain\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements provide that upon the\noccurrence of certain specified events,\nsuch as a change to our or our\naffiliates\u2019 credit ratings, we may be\nrequired to provide additional\ncollateral or take other remedial\nactions, and we could experience\nincreased difficulty obtaining funding\nor hedging risks. In some cases our\ncounterparties may have the right to\nterminate or otherwise diminish our\nrights under these contracts or\nagreements upon the occurrence of such\nevents.\n\nWe are also a member of various CCPs,\nwhich results in credit risk exposure to\nthose CCPs. In the event that one or\nmore members of a CCP default on their\nobligations, we may be required to pay a\nportion of any losses incurred by the\nCCP as a result of that default. A CCP\nmay also, at its discretion, modify the\nmargin we are required to post, which\ncould mean unexpected and increased\nfunding costs and exposure to that CCP.\nAs a clearing member, we are exposed to\nthe risk of non-performance by our\nclients for which we clear transactions,\nwhich may not be covered by available\ncollateral. Additionally, default by a\nsignificant market participant may\nresult in further risk and potential\nlosses.\n                                                                                  \n  Geopolitical                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to numerous political,\neconomic, market, reputational,\noperational, compliance, legal,\nregulatory and other risks in the\njurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe do business throughout the world,\nincluding in emerging markets. Economic\nor geopolitical stress in one or more\ncountries could have a negative impact\nregionally or globally, resulting in,\namong other things, market volatility,\nreduced market value and economic\noutput. Our liquidity and credit risk\ncould be adversely impacted by, and our\nbusinesses and revenues derived from\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to,\nrisk of loss from financial, social or\njudicial instability, economic\nsanctions, changes in government\nleadership, including as a result of\nelectoral outcomes or otherwise, changes\nin governmental policies or policies of\ncentral banks, expropriation,\nnationalization and/or confiscation of\nassets, price controls, high inflation,\nnatural disasters, the emergence or\ncontinuation of widespread health\nemergencies or pandemics, capital\ncontrols, currency re-denomination risk\nfrom a country exiting the EU or\notherwise, currency fluctuations,\nforeign exchange controls or movements\n(caused by devaluation or de-pegging),\nunfavorable political and diplomatic\ndevelopments, oil price fluctuations and\nchanges in legislation. These risks are\nespecially elevated in emerging markets.\n\nContinued tensions between the U.S. and\nimportant trading partners, particularly\nChina, may result in sanctions, further\ntariff increases or other restrictive\nactions on cross-border trade,\ninvestment and transfer of information\ntechnology, which could reduce trade\nvolumes, result in further supply chain\ndisruptions, increase costs for\nproducers, and adversely affect our\n\nbusinesses and revenues, as well as our\ncustomers and counterparties, including\ntheir credit quality.\n\nSlowing growth, recessionary conditions,\nadverse geopolitical conditions and/or\npolitical or civil unrest, labor\nshortages, wage pressures and elevated\ninflation in certain countries pose\nchallenges, including in the form of\nvolatility in financial markets. Foreign\nexchange rates against the U.S. dollar\nremain an area of uncertainty and\npotential volatility, and depreciation\ncould increase our financial risks with\nclients that deal in non-U.S. currencies\nbut have U.S. dollar-denominated debt.\n\nWe invest or trade in the securities of\ncorporations and governments located in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions, including\nemerging markets. Revenues from the\ntrading of non-U.S. securities may be\nsubject to negative fluctuations as a\nresult of the above factors.\nFurthermore, the impact of these\nfluctuations could be magnified because\nnon-U.S. trading markets, particularly\nin emerging markets, are generally\nsmaller, less liquid and more volatile\nthan U.S. trading markets. Risks in one\nnation can limit our opportunities for\nportfolio growth and negatively affect\nour operations in other nations,\nincluding our U.S. operations. Market\nand economic disruptions may affect\nconsumer confidence levels and spending,\ncorporate investment and job creation,\nbankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence\nand default on consumer and corporate\ndebt, economic growth rates and asset\nvalues, among other factors.\n\nElevated government debt levels raise\nthe risk of volatility, significant\nvaluation changes, political tensions\namong EU members regarding fiscal policy\nor defaults on or devaluation of\nsovereign debt, which could expose us to\nsubstantial losses. Financial markets\nhave been and may continue to be\nsensitive to government plans to lower\ntaxes or increase spending.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by governments,\nsecurities exchanges and regulators,\ncentral banks and other regulatory\nbodies. In many countries, the laws and\nregulations applicable to the financial\nservices and securities industries are\nless predictable, prone to change and\nuncertainty, and regularly evolving.\nSignificant resources are spent on\ndetermining, understanding and\nmonitoring foreign laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as managing our\nrelationships with multiple regulators\nin various jurisdictions. Our inability\nto remain in compliance with local laws\nand manage our relationships with\nregulators could result in increased\nexpenses, changes to our organizational\nstructure and adversely affect our\nbusinesses, reputation and results of\noperations in that market.\n\nWe are also subject to complex and\nextensive U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules\nand regulations, which subject us to\ncosts and risks relating to bribery and\ncorruption, know-your-customer\nrequirements, anti-money laundering,\nembargo programs and economic sanctions,\nwhich can vary by jurisdiction and\nrequire implementation of complex\noperational capabilities and compliance\nprograms. Non-compliance, including\nimproper implementation, and/or\nviolations could result in an increase\nin operational and compliance costs, and\nenforcement actions and civil and\ncriminal penalties against us and\nindividual employees. The increasing\nspeed and novel ways in which funds\ncirculate could make it more challenging\nto track the movement of funds and\nheighten financial crimes risk.\nCompliance with these evolving\nregulatory regimes and legal\nrequirements depends on our ability to\nimprove our processes, controls,\nsurveillance, detection and reporting\nand analytic capabilities.\n\nIn the U.S., the government\u2019s debt\nceiling and budget deficit concerns have\nincreased the possibility of U.S.\ngovernment defaults on its debt and/or\nfurther downgrades to its credit\nratings, and prolonged government\nshutdowns, which could\n                                                                                  \n  13Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nweaken the U.S. dollar, cause market\nvolatility, negatively impact the global\neconomy and banking system and adversely\naffect our financial condition,\nincluding our liquidity. Additionally,\nchanges in fiscal, monetary, regulatory\nand/or foreign policy, including as a\nresult of the election cycle, labor\nshortages, wage pressures, supply chain\ndisruptions and higher inflation, could\nincrease our compliance costs and\nadversely affect our business\noperations, organizational structure and\nresults of operations. Emerging market\ncurrency values and monetary policy\nsettings are particularly sensitive to\nsuch changes in U.S. monetary policy.\nAdditionally, further restrictive U.S.\nmonetary policy, potentially including\nfurther rate increases, could result in\nadditional currency volatility and\nrecessionary conditions in a number of\nnon-U.S. markets.\n\nWe are also subject to geopolitical\nrisks, including economic sanctions,\nacts or threats of international or\ndomestic terrorism, including responses\nby the U.S. or other governments\nthereto, increased state-sponsored\ncyberattacks or campaigns, civil unrest\nand/or military conflicts, including the\nescalation of tensions between China and\nTaiwan, which could adversely affect\nbusiness, market trade and general\neconomic conditions abroad and in the\nU.S. The Russia/Ukraine conflict and the\nconflict in the Middle East have\nmagnified such risks and resulted in\nregional instability and adversely\nimpacted commodity and other financial\nmarkets, as well as economic conditions,\nespecially in Europe. Widening regional\nconflicts resulting in the involvement\nof neighboring countries and/or North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization member\ncountries could result in additional\neconomic disruptions, financial market\nvolatility, higher inflation and changes\nto asset valuations, which could disrupt\nour operations and adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Business Operations                                                             \n                                                                                  \nA failure in or breach of our operations\nor information systems, or those of\nthird parties or the financial services\nindustry, could cause disruptions,\nadversely impact our businesses, results\nof operations and financial condition,\nand cause legal or reputational harm.\n\nOperational risk exposure exists\nthroughout our organization and as a\nresult of our extensive interactions\nwith, and reliance on, third parties and\nthe financial services industry,\nincluding the processing and reporting\nof a large number of transactions in\nmany currencies and jurisdictions. Our\noperations and information systems,\nwhich comprise the hardware, software,\ninfrastructure, backup systems and other\ntechnology which we own or use to\ncollect, process, maintain, use, share,\ndisseminate or dispose of information,\nare integral to the performance of our\nbusinesses.\n\nOur operations and information systems\nand components thereof, and those of our\nthird parties, have been, and in the\nfuture could be, ineffective or fail to\noperate properly or become disabled or\ndamaged as a result of a number of\nfactors, including events that are\nwholly or partially beyond our or such\nthird party\u2019s control. Such events have\nadversely affected, and in the future\ncould adversely affect, physical site\naccess of our operations, our ability to\nprocess transactions, provide services\nand perform other operations. Short-term\nor prolonged disruptions to our critical\nbusiness operations and customer\nservices are possible due to computer,\ntelecommunications, network, utility,\nelectronic or physical infrastructure\noutages, including from abuse or failure\nof our electronic trading and\nalgorithmic platforms, significant\nunplanned increases in customer\ntransactions, fraudulent transactions,\nnewly identified vulnerabilities in key\nhardware and software, failure of\n\ninfrastructure or manual processes,\ntechnology project implementation\nchallenges and supply chain disruptions.\nOperational disruptions and prolonged\noperational outages could also result\nfrom events arising from natural\ndisasters, including acute and chronic\nweather events, such as wildfires,\ntornadoes, hurricanes and floods, some\nof which are happening with more\nfrequency and severity, and earthquakes,\nas well as local or larger scale\npolitical or social matters, including\ncivil unrest, terrorist acts and\nmilitary conflict.\n\nWe continue to have greater reliance on\nour and our third parties\u2019 remote access\ntools and technology, and employees\u2019\npersonal systems and increased data\nutilization and dependence upon our\ninformation systems to operate our\nbusinesses remotely, including as a\nresult of evolving customer preferences,\nwhich has led to increased reliance on\ndigital banking and other digital\nservices provided by our businesses.\nEffective management of our business\ncontinuity increasingly depends on the\nsecurity, reliability and adequacy of\nsuch systems.\n\nWe also rely on our employees,\nrepresentatives and third parties in our\nday-to-day operations, who may, due to\nillness, unavailability, the emergence\nor continuation of health emergencies or\npandemics, human error, misconduct\n(including errors in judgment, malice,\nfraud or illegal activity), malfeasance\nor a failure or breach of information\nsystems, cause disruptions to our\norganization and expose us to\noperational losses, regulatory risk and\nreputational harm. Our and our third\nparties\u2019 inability to properly\nintroduce, deploy and manage operational\nchanges, including with regard to\ninternal financial and governance\nprocesses, existing products, services\nand technology, and new product\ninnovations and technology, could also\nresult in additional operational and\nregulatory risk.\n\nRegardless of the measures we have taken\nto implement training, procedures,\nbackup systems and other safeguards to\nsupport our operations and bolster our\noperational resilience, our ability to\nconduct business may be adversely\naffected by significant disruptions to\nus or to third parties with whom we\ninteract or upon whom we rely, including\nlocalized or systemic cyber events that\nresult in information systems outages\nand unavailability of part or all of the\ninternet, cloud services and/or the\nfinancial services industry\ninfrastructure (including electronic\ntrading and algorithmic platforms and\ncritical banking activities). Our\nability to implement backup systems and\nother safeguards with respect to third-\nparty systems and the financial services\nindustry infrastructure is more limited\nthan with respect to our systems.\nWeakness in our third parties\u2019 processes\nor controls could impact our ability to\ndeliver products or services to our\nclients and expose us to compliance and\noperational risks.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our\nbusiness continuity and information\nsecurity response plans will effectively\nmitigate our operational risks. Any\nbackup systems or manual processes may\nnot process data accurately and/or as\nquickly or effectively as our primary\nsystems, and some data might not have\nbeen backed up. Additionally, the speed\nin which we are able to remediate any\nfailure or disruption of our operations\nand/or information systems may vary\nacross jurisdictions. We regularly\nupdate the information systems we rely\non to support our operations and growth\nas part of our efforts to comply with\nall applicable laws, rules and\nregulations globally. This updating\nentails significant costs and creates\nrisks associated with implementing new\nor modified information systems and\nintegrating them with existing\ninformation systems, including business\ninterruptions.\n\nA failure or breach of our or our third\nparties\u2019 operations or information\nsystems resulting in disruption to our\ncritical\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America14                                                               \n                                                                                  \nbusiness operations and customer\nservices, a failure to identify or\neffectively respond to operational risks\nin a timely manner and/or a failure to\ncontinue to deliver our services through\nan operational disruption could impact\nthe confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of data and expose us to a\nnumber of risks, including market abuse,\ncustomer attrition, regulatory, market,\nprivacy and liquidity risk, adversely\nimpact our results of operations and\nfinancial condition and cause legal,\nregulatory or reputational harm.\n\nThe Corporation and third parties with\nwhom we interact and/or on whom we rely,\nare subject to cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches, and\ntechnology failures that have and in the\nfuture could adversely affect our\nability to conduct our businesses,\nresult in the misuse, destruction or\ndisclosure of information, damage our\nreputation, increase our regulatory and\nlegal risks, result in additional costs\nor financial losses and/or otherwise\nadversely impact our businesses and\nresults of operations.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the\nsecurity, controls and efficacy of our\ninformation systems, and the information\nsystems of our customers, third parties,\nthe financial services industry and\nfinancial data aggregators with whom we\ninteract, on whom we rely or who have\naccess to our customers' personal or\naccount information. We rely on\neffective access management and the\nsecure collection, processing,\nmaintenance, use, sharing, dissemination\nand disposition of information in our\nand our third parties\u2019 information\nsystems. Our cybersecurity risk and\nexposure remains heightened because of,\namong other things, our prominent size\nand scale, high-profile brand,\ngeographic footprint and international\npresence and role in the financial\nservices industry and the broader\neconomy. The proliferation of third-\nparty financial data aggregators and\nemerging technologies, including our and\nour third parties\u2019 use of automation,\nartificial intelligence (AI) and\nrobotics, increases our cybersecurity\nrisks and exposure.\n\nWe, our employees, customers, regulators\nand third parties are ongoing targets of\nan increasing number of cybersecurity\nthreats and cyberattacks. The tactics,\ntechniques and procedures used in\ncyberattacks are pervasive,\nsophisticated and designed to evade\nsecurity measures, including computer\nviruses, malicious or destructive code\n(such as ransomware), social engineering\n(including phishing, vishing and\nsmishing), denial of service or\ninformation or other security breach\ntactics that have and in the future\ncould result in disruptions to our\nbusinesses and operations and the loss\nof funds, including from attempts to\ndefraud us and/or our customers, and\nimpact the confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of our information,\nincluding intellectual property, or that\nof our employees, customers and third\nparties. Cyberattacks are carried out on\na worldwide scale and by a growing\nnumber of actors, including organized\ncrime groups, hackers, terrorist\norganizations, extremist parties,\nhostile foreign governments, state-\nsponsored actors, activists, disgruntled\nemployees and other persons or entities,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage.\n\nCybersecurity threats and the tactics,\ntechniques and procedures used in\ncyberattacks change, develop and evolve\nrapidly, including from emerging\ntechnologies, such as AI, machine\nlearning and quantum computing. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to protect the\nintegrity and resilience of our\ninformation systems and implement\ncontrols, processes, policies, employee\ntraining and other protective measures,\nwe are not able to anticipate and/or\ndetect all cybersecurity threats and\nincidents and/or develop or implement\neffective preventive or defensive\nmeasures designed to prevent, respond to\nor mitigate all cybersecurity threats\nand incidents. Internal access\n\nmanagement failures could impact the\nconfidentiality, integrity or\navailability of data. Additionally, the\nfailure of our employees to exercise\nsound judgment and vigilance when\ntargeted with social engineering or\nother cyberattacks increases our\nvulnerability.\n\nOur risk from and exposure to\ncybersecurity threats and incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures continues to\nincrease due to the acceptance and use\nof digital banking and other digital\nproducts and services, including mobile\nbanking products, and reliance on remote\naccess tools and technology, which have\nincreased our reliance on virtual or\ndigital interactions and a larger number\nof access points to our information\nsystems that must be secured, and\nresults in greater amounts of\ninformation being available for access.\nGreater demand on our information\nsystems and security tools and processes\nwill likely continue.\n\nWe also face significant third-party\ntechnology, cybersecurity and\noperational risks relating to the large\nnumber of customers and third parties\nwith whom we do business, the financial\nservices industry, upon whom we rely to\nfacilitate or enable our business\nactivities or upon whom our customers\nrely, including the secure collection,\nprocessing, maintenance, use, sharing,\ndissemination and disposition of\ncustomer and other sensitive\ninformation, providers of products\nand/or services, financial\ncounterparties, financial data\naggregators, financial intermediaries,\nsuch as clearing agents, exchanges and\nclearing houses, regulators, providers\nof outsourced infrastructure, such as\ninternet access, cloud service providers\nand electrical power, and retailers for\nwhom we process transactions. Such\nthird-party information systems extend\nbeyond our security and control systems,\nand such third parties have varying\nlevels of security and cybersecurity\nresources, expertise, safeguards,\ncontrols and capabilities. Threat actors\nmay actively seek to exploit security\nand cybersecurity weaknesses at our\nthird parties and the relationships of\nour third parties with us may increase\nthe risk that they are targeted by the\nsame threats we face, and such third\nparties may be less prepared for such\nthreats. We are also at additional risk\nresulting from critical third-party\ninformation security and open-source\nsoftware vulnerabilities. We must rely\non our third parties to adequately\ndetect and promptly report cybersecurity\nincidents, and their failure to do so\ncould adversely affect our ability to\nreport or respond to cybersecurity\nincidents effectively or timely.\n\nDue to increasing consolidation,\ninterdependence and complexity of\nfinancial entities and technology and\ninformation systems, a cybersecurity\nthreat or incident, information or\nsecurity breach or technology failure\nthat significantly exposes, degrades,\ndestroys or compromises the information\nsystems or information of one or more\nfinancial entities or third parties\ncould adversely impact us and increase\nthe risk of operational failure and\nloss, as disparate systems need to be\nintegrated, often on an accelerated\nbasis. Similarly, any cybersecurity\nthreat or incident, information or\nsecurity breach or technology failure\nthat significantly exposes, degrades,\ndestroys or compromises our information\nsystems or information could adversely\nimpact third parties and the critical\ninfrastructure of the financial services\nindustry, thereby creating additional\nrisk for us.\n\nCybersecurity incidents or information\nor security breaches could persist for\nan extended period of time before being\ndetected, and it often takes additional\ntime to determine the scope, extent,\namount and type of impact, including\ninformation altered, destroyed or\notherwise compromised, following which\nthe measures to recover and restore to a\nbusiness-as-usual state may be difficult\nto assess. We have spent and expect to\ncontinue to spend significant resources\nto modify and enhance\n                                                                                  \n  15Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nour protective measures, investigate and\nremediate software and network\nvulnerabilities, and defend against,\ndetect and respond to cybersecurity\nthreats and incidents whether specific\nto us, a third party, the industry or\nbusinesses in general, and enhance our\ncapabilities to respond and recover.\n\nWhile we and our third parties have\nexperienced cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation and security breaches and\ntechnology failures, as well as adverse\nimpacts from such events, including as\ndescribed in this risk factor, we have\nnot experienced material losses or other\nmaterial consequences relating to\ncybersecurity incidents, information or\nsecurity breaches or technology\nfailures, whether directed at us or our\nthird parties. However, we expect to\ncontinue to experience such events and\nimpacts with increased frequency and\nseverity due to the evolving threat\nenvironment, and there can be no\nassurance that future cybersecurity\nincidents, information and security\nbreaches and technology failures,\nincluding as a result of cybersecurity\nincidents, information and security\nbreaches and technology failures\nexperienced by our third parties, will\nnot have a material adverse impact on\nus, including our businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nAny future cybersecurity incident,\ninformation or security breach or\ntechnology failure suffered by us or our\nthird parties could result in disruption\nto our day-to-day business activities,\nan inability to effect transactions,\nexecute trades, service our customers,\nmanage our exposure to risk, expand our\nbusinesses, detect and prevent\nfraudulent or unauthorized transactions,\nincluding transactions impacting our\ncustomers, maintain information systems\naccess and business operations and\ncustomer services, in the U.S. and/or\nglobally. Additionally, we could\nexperience the loss of customers and\nbusiness opportunities, the withdrawal\nof customer deposits, the\nmisappropriation, alteration or\ndestruction of our or our third parties\u2019\nintellectual property or confidential\ninformation, the unauthorized access to\nor temporary or permanent loss or theft\nof personally identifiable information,\nincluding of our employees and\ncustomers, significant lost revenue,\nlosses and claims brought by third\nparties, violations of applicable\nprivacy, cybersecurity and other laws,\nrules and regulations, litigation\nexposure, economic sanctions,\nenforcement actions, government fines,\npenalties or intervention and other\nnegative consequences. Although we\nmaintain cyber insurance, there can be\nno assurance that liabilities or losses\nwe may incur will be covered under such\npolicies or that the amount of insurance\nwill be adequate. In addition, in the\ncase of any cybersecurity incident,\ninformation or security breach or\ntechnology failure arising from third-\nparty systems impacting us, any third-\nparty indemnification may not be\napplicable or sufficient to address the\nimpact of such cybersecurity incidents,\ninformation or security breaches or\ntechnology failures, including monetary\nlosses of the Corporation. The\noccurrence of any of the events\ndescribed above could adversely impact\nour businesses, results of operations,\nliquidity and financial condition, as\nwell as cause reputational harm, whether\nsuch events are actual or perceived.\n\nFailure to satisfy our obligations as\nservicer for residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, loans owned by other\nentities and other related losses could\nadversely impact our reputation,\nservicing costs or results of\noperations.\n\nWe service mortgage loans on behalf of\nthird-party securitization vehicles and\nother investors. If we commit a material\nbreach of our obligations as servicer or\nmaster servicer, we may be subject to\ntermination if the breach is not cured\nwithin a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which could cause us\nto lose servicing income. We may also\nhave liability for any failure by us, as\na servicer or master servicer, for\n\nany act or omission on our part that\ninvolves willful misfeasance, bad faith,\ngross negligence or reckless disregard\nof our duties. If any such breach was\nfound to have occurred, it may harm our\nreputation, increase our servicing costs\nor losses due to potential\nindemnification obligations, result in\nlitigation or regulatory action or\nadversely impact our results of\noperations. Additionally, foreclosures\nmay result in costs, litigation or\nlosses due to irregularities in the\nunderlying documentation, or if the\nvalidity of a foreclosure action is\nchallenged by a borrower or overturned\nby a court because of errors or\ndeficiencies in the foreclosure process.\nWe may also incur costs or losses\nrelating to delays or alleged\ndeficiencies in processing documents\nnecessary to comply with state law\ngoverning foreclosure.\n\nChanges in the structure of and\nrelationship among the GSEs could\nadversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or\npurchase mortgage loans that meet their\nconforming loan requirements. During\n2023, we sold approximately $3.1 billion\nof loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac\n(FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are\ncurrently in conservatorship, with the\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\nacting as conservator. In 2019, the\nTreasury Department published a proposal\nto recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and\nremove them from conservatorship and\nreduce their role in the marketplace. In\nJanuary 2021, the Treasury Department\nfurther amended the agreement that\ngoverns the conservatorship of FHLMC and\nFNMA and delineated the continued\nobjective to remove the GSEs from\nconservatorship. However, we cannot\npredict the future prospects of the\nGSEs, timing of the recapitalization or\nrelease from conservatorship, or content\nof legislative or rulemaking proposals\nregarding the future status of the GSEs\nin the housing market. If the GSEs take\na reduced role in the marketplace,\nincluding by limiting the mortgage\nproducts they offer, we could be\nrequired to seek alternative funding\nsources, retain additional loans on our\nbalance sheet, secure funding through\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank system, or\nsecuritize the loans through Private\nLabel Securitization, which could\nincrease our cost of funds related to\nthe origination of new mortgage loans,\nincrease credit risk and/or impact our\ncapacity to originate new mortgage\nloans. Uncertainty regarding their\nfuture and the MBS they guarantee\ncontinues to exist for the foreseeable\nfuture. These developments could\nadversely affect our securities\nportfolios, capital levels, liquidity\nand results of operations.\n\nOur risk management framework may not be\neffective in mitigating risk and\nreducing the potential for losses.\n\nOur risk management framework is\ndesigned to minimize risk and loss to\nus. We seek to effectively and\nconsistently identify, measure, monitor,\nreport and control the key types of risk\nto which we are subject, including\nstrategic, credit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and reputational\nrisks. Risks also may span across\nmultiple key risk types, including\ncybersecurity risk, climate risk and\nlegal risk. While we employ a broad and\ndiversified set of controls and risk\nmitigation techniques, including\nmodeling and forecasting, hedging\nstrategies and techniques that seek to\nbalance our ability to profit from\ntrading positions with our exposure to\npotential losses, our ability to control\nand mitigate risks that result in losses\nis inherently limited by our ability to\nidentify and measure all risks,\nincluding emerging and unknown risks,\nanticipate the timing and impact of\nrisks, apply effective hedging\nstrategies, make correct assumptions,\nmanage and aggregate data correctly and\nefficiently, identify changes in markets\nor client behaviors not yet inherent in\nhistorical data and develop risk\nmanagement models and forecasts to\nassess and control risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOur ability to manage risk is dependent\non our ability to consistently execute\nall elements of our risk management\nprogram, develop and maintain a culture\nof managing risk well throughout the\nCorporation and manage risks associated\nwith third parties, including providers\nof products and/or services, to allow\nfor effective risk management and help\nconfirm that risks are appropriately\nconsidered, evaluated and responded to\nin a timely manner. Uncertain economic\nand geopolitical conditions, health\nemergencies and pandemics, heightened\nlegislative and regulatory scrutiny of\nand change within the financial services\nindustry, the pace of technological\nchanges, accounting, tax and market\ndevelopments, the failure of employees,\nrepresentatives and third parties to\ncomply with our policies and Risk\nFramework and the overall complexity of\nour operations, among other\ndevelopments, have in the past and may\nin the future result in a heightened\nlevel of risk, including operational,\nreputational and compliance risk. Our\nfailure to manage evolving risks or\nproperly anticipate, manage, control or\nmitigate risks could result in\nadditional losses and adversely affect\nour results of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe are highly regulated and subject to\nevolving government legislation and\nregulations and certain settlements,\norders and agreements with government\nauthorities from time to time.\n\nOur businesses are highly regulated and\nwe are subject to evolving and\ncomprehensive regulation under federal\nand state laws in the U.S. and the laws\nof the various foreign jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, including increasing\nand complex economic sanctions regimes.\nThese laws and regulations significantly\naffect and have the potential to\nrestrict the scope of our existing\nbusinesses, require changes to our\nbusiness strategies, limit our ability\nto pursue certain business\nopportunities, including the products\nand services we offer, reduce certain\nfees and rates and/or make our products\nand services more expensive for our\nclients. We are also required to file\nvarious financial and nonfinancial\nregulatory reports to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations in the\njurisdictions in which we operate, which\nresults in additional compliance risk.\n\nWe continue to adjust our business and\noperations, legal entity structure,\ndisclosure and policies, processes,\nprocedures and controls, including with\nregard to capital and liquidity\nmanagement, risk management and data\nmanagement, in an effort to comply with\nlaws, rules and regulations, as well as\nevolving expectations, guidance and\ninterpretation by regulatory\nauthorities, including the Department of\nTreasury (including the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) and OFAC), Federal\nReserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability\nOversight Council, FDIC, Department of\nLabor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S., foreign\nregulators, other government authorities\nand self-regulatory organizations.\nFurther, we expect to become subject to\nfuture laws, rules and regulations\nbeyond those currently proposed, adopted\nor contemplated in the U.S. or abroad,\nas well as evolving interpretations of\nexisting and future laws, rules and\nregulations, which may include policies\nand rulemaking related to FDIC\nassessments, loss allocations between\nfinancial institutions and customers\nwith regard to the use of our products\nand services, including electronic\npayments, emerging technologies, such as\nthe development and use of AI and\nmachine learning, cybersecurity and\ndata, and further climate risk\nmanagement and ESG reporting, including\nemissions and sustainability disclosure.\nThe cumulative effect of all of the\ncurrent and possible future legislation\nand regulations, as well as related\ninterpretations, on our litigation and\nregulatory exposure, businesses,\noperations and profitability remains\nuncertain and necessitates that we make\ncertain assumptions\n\nwith respect to the scope and\nrequirements of existing, prospective\nand proposed laws, rules and regulations\nin our business planning and strategies.\nIf these assumptions prove incorrect, we\ncould be subject to increased\nregulatory, legal and compliance risks\nand costs, as well as potential\nreputational harm. Also, U.S. and\nregulatory initiatives abroad may\noverlap, and non-U.S. regulation and\ninitiatives may be inconsistent or may\nconflict with current or proposed U.S.\nregulations, which could lead to\ncompliance risks and increased costs.\n\nOur regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad\npower and discretion to direct our\nactions, and they have assumed an active\noversight, inspection and investigatory\nrole across the financial services\nindustry. Regulatory focus is not\nlimited to laws, rules and regulations\napplicable to the financial services\nindustry, but includes other significant\nlaws, rules and regulations that apply\nacross industries and jurisdictions,\nincluding those related to anti-money\nlaundering, anti-bribery, anti-\ncorruption know-your-customer\nrequirements, embargo programs and\neconomic sanctions.\n\nWe are also subject to laws, rules and\nregulations in the U.S. and abroad,\nincluding the GDPR and CCPA as modified\nby the CPRA, and a number of additional\njurisdictions enacting or considering\nsimilar laws or amendments to existing\nlaws, regarding privacy and the\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing and\nsafeguarding of personally identifiable\ninformation, including our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, counterparties and\nother third parties, the violation of\nwhich could result in litigation,\nregulatory fines, enforcement actions\nand operational loss. Additionally, we\nare and will continue to be subject to\nnew and evolving data privacy laws in\nthe U.S. and abroad, which could result\nin additional costs of compliance,\nlitigation, regulatory fines and\nenforcement actions. There remains\ncomplexity and uncertainty, including\npotential suspension or prohibition,\nregarding data transfer because of\nconcerns over compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations for cross-border\nflows and transfers of personal data\nfrom the European Economic Area (EEA) to\nthe U.S. and other jurisdictions outside\nof the EEA, resulting from judicial and\nregulatory guidance. To the extent that\na new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\nleads to a relaxation of applicable\nlegislation and regulations, regardless\nof transfer mechanism, challenges are\nexpected from consumer advocacy groups.\nOther jurisdictions, including China and\nIndia, have commenced consultation\nefforts or enacted new legislation or\nregulations to establish standards for\npersonal data transfers. If cross-border\npersonal data transfers are suspended or\nrestricted or we are required to\nimplement distinct processes for each\njurisdiction\u2019s standards, this could\nresult in operational disruptions to our\nbusinesses, additional costs, increased\nenforcement activity, new contract\nnegotiations with third parties, and/or\nmodification of such data management.\n\nAs part of their enforcement authority,\nour regulators and other government\nauthorities have the authority to, among\nother things, conduct investigations and\nassess significant civil or criminal\nmonetary fines, penalties or\nrestitution, issue cease and desist\norders, suspend or withdraw licenses and\nauthorizations, initiate injunctive\naction, apply regulatory sanctions or\ncause us to enter into consent orders.\nThe amounts paid by us and other\nfinancial institutions to settle\nproceedings or investigations have, in\nsome instances, been substantial and may\nincrease. In some cases, governmental\nauthorities have required criminal pleas\nor other extraordinary terms as part of\nsuch resolutions, which could have\nsignificant consequences, including\nreputational harm, loss of customers,\nrestrictions on the ability to access\ncapital markets, and the inability to\noperate certain businesses or offer\ncertain products.\n                                                                                  \n  17Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOur response to regulators and other\ngovernment authorities may be time-\nconsuming, expensive and divert\nmanagement attention from our business.\nThe outcome of any matter, which may\nlast years, may be difficult to predict\nor estimate.\n\nThe terms of settlements, orders and\nagreements that we have entered into\nwith government entities and regulatory\nauthorities have also imposed, or could\nimpose, significant operational and\ncompliance costs on us with respect to\nenhancements to our procedures and\ncontrols, losses with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated\nagainst our customers, expansion of our\nrisk and control functions within our\nlines of business, investment in\ntechnology and the hiring of significant\nnumbers of additional risk, control and\ncompliance personnel. If we fail to meet\nthe requirements of the regulatory\nsettlements, orders or agreements to\nwhich we are subject, or, more\ngenerally, fail to maintain risk and\ncontrol procedures and processes that\nmeet the heightened standards\nestablished by our regulators and other\ngovernment authorities, we could be\nrequired to enter into further\nsettlements, orders or agreements and\npay additional fines, penalties or\njudgments, or accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on our businesses.\n\nImproper actions, behaviors or practices\nby us, our employees or representatives\nthat are illegal, unethical or contrary\nto our core values could harm us, our\nshareholders or customers or damage the\nintegrity of the financial markets, and\nare subject to regulatory scrutiny\nacross jurisdictions. The complexity of\nthe regulatory and enforcement regimes\nin the U.S., coupled with the global\nscope of our operations and the\nregulatory environment worldwide, also\nmeans that a single event or practice or\na series of related events or practices\nmay give rise to a significant number of\noverlapping investigations and\nregulatory proceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state agencies in\nthe U.S. or by multiple regulators and\nother governmental entities in different\njurisdictions. Actions by other members\nof the financial services industry\nrelated to business activities in which\nwe participate may result in\ninvestigations by regulators or other\ngovernment authorities.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adopted\nappropriate risk management and\ncompliance programs, compliance risks\nwill continue to exist, particularly as\nwe anticipate and adapt to new and\nevolving laws, rules and regulations and\nevolving interpretations. We also rely\nupon third parties who may expose us to\ncompliance and legal risk. Future\nlegislative or regulatory actions, and\nany required changes to our business or\noperations or strategy, or those of\nthird parties upon whom we rely,\nresulting from such developments and\nactions could result in a significant\nloss of revenue, impose additional\ncompliance and other costs or otherwise\nreduce our profitability, limit the\nproducts and services that we offer or\nour ability to pursue certain business\nopportunities, require us to dispose of\ncertain businesses or assets, require us\nto curtail certain businesses, affect\nthe value of assets that we hold,\nnecessitate changes in our compensation\npractices, require us to increase our\nprices and therefore reduce demand for\nour products, or otherwise adversely\naffect our businesses.\n\nWe are subject to significant financial\nand reputational risks from potential\nliability arising from lawsuits and\nregulatory and government action.\n\nWe face significant legal risks in our\nbusiness, with a high volume of claims\nagainst us and other financial\ninstitutions. The amount of damages,\npenalties and fines that litigants and\nregulators seek from us and other\nfinancial institutions continues to be\nsignificant. This includes disputes with\nconsumers, customers and other\ncounterparties.\n\nFinancial institutions, including us,\ncontinue to be the subject of claims\nalleging anti-competitive conduct with\nrespect to various products and markets,\nincluding U.S. antitrust class actions\nclaiming joint and several liability for\ntreble damages. As disclosed in Note 12\n\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, we\nalso face contractual indemnification\nand loan-repurchase claims arising from\nalleged breaches of representations and\nwarranties in the sale of residential\nmortgages by legacy companies, which may\nresult in a requirement that we\nrepurchase the mortgage loans, or make\nwhole or provide other remedies to\ncounterparties.\n\nU.S. regulators and government agencies\nregularly pursue enforcement claims\nagainst financial institutions,\nincluding us, for alleged violations of\nlaw and customer harm, including under\nthe Financial Institutions Reform,\nRecovery, and Enforcement Act, the\nfederal securities laws, the False\nClaims Act, fair lending laws and\nregulations (including the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and the Fair Housing\nAct), the FCPA, the BSA, regulations\nissued by OFAC, Home Mortgage Disclosure\nAct, antitrust laws, and consumer\nprotection laws and regulations related\nto products and services such as\noverdraft and sales practices, including\nprohibitions on unfair, deceptive,\nand/or abusive acts and practices\n(UDAAP) under the Consumer Financial\nProtection Act and the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and EFTA, as well as\nother enforcement action taken by\nprudential regulators with respect to\nsafety, soundness and appropriateness of\nour business practices. Such claims may\ncarry significant penalties, restitution\nand, in certain cases, treble damages,\nand the ultimate resolution of\nregulatory inquiries, investigations and\nother proceedings which we are subject\nto from time-to-time is difficult to\npredict.\n\nT here is also an increased focus on\ninformation security. This includes\ncybersecurity incidents perpetrated\nagainst us, our customers, providers of\nproducts and services, counterparties\nand other third parties, the collection,\nuse and sharing of data, and\nsafeguarding of personally identifiable\ninformation and corporate data, as well\nas the development, implementation, use\nand management of emerging technologies,\nincluding AI and machine learning.\nRelated litigation or government\nenforcement, including with regard to\ncompliance with U.S. and global laws,\nrules and regulations, could subject us\nto fines, judgments and/or settlements\nand involve reputational losses.\nAdditionally, misconduct by our\nemployees and representatives, including\nunethical, fraudulent, improper or\nillegal conduct, the failure to fulfill\nfiduciary obligations, unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive or discriminatory\nbusiness practices, or violations of\npolicies, procedures, laws, rules or\nregulations, including conduct that\naffects compliance with books and\nrecords requirements, have resulted and\ncould result in further litigation\nand/or government investigations and\nenforcement actions, and cause\nsignificant reputational harm. In\nparticular, we are the subject of\nlitigation and regulatory and government\ninquiries regarding our processing of\nelectronic payments, our efforts to\ndetect, prevent and address fraud\nperpetrated against our customers and/or\nthe handling of fraud-related disputes,\nwhich could result in fines, judgments,\nand/or settlements, as well as adversely\naffect our businesses and strategies due\nto the treatment of loss allocations\nbetween customers and us, all of which\ncould also have an adverse impact on\nother similar products and services. We\nare also subject to increasing scrutiny\nof sustainability-related policies,\ngoals, targets and disclosure, which\ncould result in litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions and\nreputational harm.\n\nThe global environment of extensive\ninvestigations, regulation, regulatory\ncompliance burdens, litigation and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18                                                               \n                                                                                  \nregulatory enforcement, combined with\nuncertainty related to the continually\nevolving regulatory environment, have\naffected and will likely continue to\naffect operational and compliance costs\nand risks, including the adaptation of\nbusiness strategies and/or limitation or\ncessation of our ability or feasibility\nto continue providing certain products\nand services. Lawsuits and regulatory\nactions have resulted in and will likely\ncontinue to result in judgments, orders,\nsettlements, penalties and fines adverse\nto us. Further, we entered into orders\nwith certain government agencies\nregarding credit card sales and\nmarketing practices and the\nrepresentment of non-sufficient fund\nfees, as well as our participation in\nimplementing government relief measures\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and\nother federal and state government\nassistance programs, including the\nprocessing of unemployment benefits for\nCalifornia and certain other states, and\ncontinue to be involved in related\nlitigation that may result in judgments\nand/or settlements. Litigation and\ninvestigation costs, substantial legal\nliability or significant regulatory or\ngovernment action against us could\nadversely affect our businesses,\nfinancial condition, including\nliquidity, and results of operations,\nand/or cause significant reputational\nharm.\n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may\nrequire us to increase our regulatory\ncapital, total loss-absorbing capacity\n(TLAC), long-term debt or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. regulatory\ncapital and liquidity rules. These\nrules, among other things, establish\nminimum requirements to qualify as a\nwell-capitalized institution. If any of\nour subsidiary insured depository\ninstitutions fail to maintain their\nstatus as well capitalized under the\napplicable regulatory capital rules, the\nFederal Reserve will require us to agree\nto bring the insured depository\ninstitution back to well-capitalized\nstatus. For the duration of such an\nagreement, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose restrictions on our activities.\nIf we were to fail to enter into or\ncomply with such an agreement, the\nFederal Reserve may impose more severe\nrestrictions on our activities,\nincluding requiring us to cease and\ndesist activities permitted under the\nBank Holding Company Act of 1956.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements are\nfrequently introduced and amended.\nRegulators may increase regulatory\ncapital requirements, including TLAC and\nlong-term debt requirements, change how\nregulatory capital or RWA is calculated\nor increase liquidity requirements. In\n2023, U.S. banking regulators issued\nproposals to revise the calculation of\nthe G-SIB surcharge and TLAC and long-\nterm debt requirements. Our ability to\nreturn capital to our shareholders\ndepends in part on our ability to\nmaintain regulatory capital levels above\nminimum requirements plus buffers. To\nthe extent that increases occur in our\nSCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical\ncapital buffer, our returns of capital\nto shareholders, including common stock\ndividends and common stock repurchases,\ncould decrease. For example, our G-SIB\nsurcharge increased by 50 bps to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024. The Federal\nReserve could also limit or prohibit\ncapital actions, such as paying or\nincreasing dividends or repurchasing\ncommon stock, as a result of economic\ndisruptions or events.\n\nAs part of its annual CCAR, we are\nsubject to extensive regulatory\nevaluation of capital planning practices\nby the Federal Reserve, including stress\ntesting on parts of our business using\nhypothetical economic scenarios prepared\nby the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios\nmay affect our CCAR stress test results,\nwhich may impact our SCB level,\nrequiring us to hold additional capital\nor causing changes in required capital\nbuffers.\n\nA significant component of regulatory\ncapital ratios is calculating our RWA\nand our leverage exposure. In July 2023,\nU.S. banking regulators issued a notice\nof proposed rulemaking to revise several\nkey methodologies for measuring RWA,\n\nincluding a standardized approach for\noperational risk, revised market risk\nand credit risk requirements and removal\nof the use of certain internal models,\nwhich would increase our regulatory\ncapital requirements, if adopted as\nproposed. Economic disruptions or events\nmay also cause an increase in our\nbalance sheet, RWA or leverage\nexposures, increasing required\nregulatory capital and liquidity\namounts.\n\nChanges to and compliance with the\nregulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements may impact our operations\nby requiring us to liquidate assets,\nincrease borrowings, issue additional\nequity or other securities, reduce the\namount of common stock repurchases or\ndividends, cease or alter certain\noperations, pricing strategies and\nbusiness activities or hold highly\nliquid assets, which may adversely\naffect our results of operations.\n\nChanges in accounting standards or\nassumptions in applying accounting\npolicies could adversely affect us.\n\nAccounting policies and methods are\nfundamental to how we record and report\nour financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies\nrequire the use of estimates and\nassumptions that may affect the reported\nvalue of our assets or liabilities and\nresults of operations and are critical\nbecause they require management to make\ndifficult, subjective and complex\njudgments about matters that are\ninherently uncertain. If assumptions,\nestimates or judgments are erroneously\napplied, we could be required to correct\nand restate prior-period financial\nstatements. Accounting standard-setters\nand those who interpret the accounting\nstandards, including the SEC, banking\nregulators and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may\nalso amend or even reverse their\nprevious interpretations or positions on\nhow various standards should be applied.\nThese changes may be difficult to\npredict and could impact the preparation\nand reporting of our financial\nstatements, including the application of\nnew or revised standards\nretrospectively, resulting in revisions\nto prior-period financial statements.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by changes\nin U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and\nregulations.\n\nGovernmental authorities in the U.S.\nand/or other countries could further\nchange tax laws in a way that would\nmaterially adversely affect us,\nincluding changes to the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 and Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022. Also, new guidelines issued\nby the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD),\nwhich are currently being enacted into\nlaw in some OECD countries in which we\noperate, are expected to impose a 15\npercent global minimum tax on a country-\nby-country basis. Any implementation of\nand/or change in tax laws and\nregulations or interpretations of\ncurrent or future tax laws and\nregulations could materially adversely\naffect our effective tax rate, tax\nliabilities and results of operations.\nU.S. and foreign tax laws are complex\nand our judgments, interpretations or\napplications of such tax laws could\ndiffer from that of the relevant\ngovernmental authority. This could\nresult in additional tax liabilities and\ninterest, penalties, the reduction of\ncertain tax benefits and/or the\nrequirement to make adjustments to\namounts recorded, which could be\nmaterial.\n\nAdditionally, we have U.K. net deferred\ntax assets (DTA) which consist primarily\nof net operating losses that are\nexpected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Adverse developments with respect\nto tax laws or to other material\nfactors, such as prolonged worsening of\nEurope\u2019s capital markets or changes in\nthe ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to\nconduct business in the EU, could lead\nour management to reassess and/or change\nits current conclusion that no valuation\nallowance is necessary with respect to\nour U.K. net DTA.\n                                                                                  \n  19Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Reputation                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nDamage to our reputation could harm our\nbusinesses, including our competitive\nposition and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain\ncustomers, clients, investors and\nemployees is impacted by our reputation.\nHarm to our reputation can arise from\nvarious sources, including actual or\nperceived activities of our officers,\ndirectors, employees, other\nrepresentatives, customers and third\nparties, including counterparties, such\nas fraud, misconduct and unethical\nbehavior (such as employees\u2019 sales\npractices), adequacy of our ability to\ndetect, prevent and/or respond to fraud\nperpetrated against our customers, and\nthe handling of related disputes with\nregard to the use of our products and\nservices, including electronic payments,\neffectiveness of our internal controls,\nthe fees charged to our customers,\nincluding overdraft and non-sufficient\nfund fees, compensation practices,\nlending practices, suitability or\nreasonableness of particular trading or\ninvestment strategies, the reliability\nof our research and models and\nprohibiting clients from engaging in\ncertain transactions.\n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by\nactual or perceived failure to deliver\nthe products and standards of service\nand quality expected by our customers,\nclients and the community, including the\noverstatement or mislabeling of the\nenvironmental benefits of our products,\nservices or transactions, the failure to\nprotect our customers and/or recognize\nand address customer complaints,\ncompliance failures, technology changes,\nthe implementation, management and/or\nuse of emerging technologies, including\nquantum computing, AI and machine\nlearning, the failure to maintain\neffective data management, cybersecurity\nincidents and information and security\nbreaches affecting us and our third\nparties, which have occurred and we\nexpect to continue to experience with\nincreased frequency and severity due to\nthe evolving threat environment,\nprolonged or repeated system outages,\nthe Corporation\u2019s privacy policies, the\nunintended disclosure of or failure to\nsafeguard personal, proprietary or\nconfidential information, the breach of\nthe Corporation\u2019s fiduciary obligations\nand handling of the emergence or\ncontinuation of health emergencies and\npandemics. Our reputation may be also be\nharmed by litigation and/or regulatory\nmatters and their outcomes, relating to\nthe topics discussed above or otherwise.\nFor example, we entered into orders with\ncertain government agencies regarding\ncredit card sales and marketing\npractices and the representment of non-\nsufficient fund fees, as well as our\nprocessing of unemployment benefits for\nCalifornia and certain other states, and\ncontinue to be involved in related\nlitigation, which may result in\njudgments and/or settlements. Challenges\nto our ESG practices and disclosures,\nand those of our customers and third\nparties, including from diverging views\nregarding ESG-related practices and\ndisclosures may also harm our\nreputation.\n\nIncreases in market interest rates have\nresulted in increased focus on asset and\nliability management, including HTM and\nAFS securities and related unrealized\nlosses. Perceptions of our liquidity and\nfinancial condition, actions by the\nfinancial services industry generally,\nor by certain members or individuals in\nthe industry may harm our reputation.\nAdverse publicity or negative\ninformation posted on social media by\nemployees, the media or otherwise,\nwhether or not factually correct, may\nadversely impact our business prospects\nand results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving\nlaws, regulations and interpretations\nregarding fair lending activity, UDAAP,\nelectronic funds transfers, know-your-\ncustomer requirements, data protection\nand privacy, including the GDPR and the\nCCPA as modified by the CPRA, cross-\nborder data movement,\n\ncybersecurity and other matters, as well\nas evolving and expansive\ninterpretations of these laws and\nregulations. Principles concerning the\nappropriate scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy vary considerably in\ndifferent jurisdictions, and regulatory\nand public expectations regarding the\ndefinition and scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy may remain fluid.\nThese laws may be interpreted and\napplied by various jurisdictions in a\nmanner inconsistent with our current or\nfuture practices, or with one another.\nIf personal, confidential or proprietary\ninformation of customers in our\npossession, or in the possession of\nthird parties or financial data\naggregators, is mishandled, misused or\nmismanaged, or if we do not timely or\nadequately address such information, we\nmay face regulatory, legal and\noperational risks, which could adversely\naffect our reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe could suffer reputational harm if we\nfail to properly identify and manage\npotential conflicts of interest.\nManagement of potential conflicts of\ninterest has become increasingly complex\nas we expand our business activities\nthrough more numerous transactions,\nobligations and interests with and among\nour clients. The actual or perceived\nfailure to adequately address conflicts\nof interest could affect the willingness\nof clients to use our products and\nservices, or result in litigation or\nenforcement actions, which could\nadversely affect our business.\n\nOur actual or perceived failure to\naddress these and other issues, such as\noperational risks, could give rise to\nreputational risk that could harm us and\nour business prospects, including the\nattraction and retention of customers\nand employees. Failure to appropriately\naddress any of these issues could also\ngive rise to additional regulatory\nrestrictions, legal risks and\nreputational harm, which could, among\nother consequences, increase the size\nand number of litigation claims and\ndamages asserted or subject us to\nenforcement actions, fines and\npenalties, and cause us to incur related\ncosts and expenses.\n                                                                                  \n  Other                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nReforms to benchmarks may adversely\naffect our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nRisks and challenges associated with\nreference rate reform, including the\npotential replacement of benchmark rates\nwith ARRs (e.g., the expected cessation\nof BSBY), could expose us to various\nfinancial, operational, supervisory,\nconduct and legal risk.\n\nUsage of ARRs for impacted benchmarks\nmay vary across or within categories of\ncontracts, products and services,\npotentially resulting in market\nfragmentation, decreased trading volumes\nand liquidity, increased complexity and\nmodeling and operational risks. ARRs may\nhave compositions and characteristics\nthat differ from replaced benchmarks,\nincluding limited liquidity and less\npredictable performance over time. Any\nmismatch between the adoption of ARRs in\nloans, securities and derivatives\nmarkets may impact hedging or other\nfinancial arrangements we have\nimplemented, resulting in unanticipated\nmarket exposures. Transition to ARRs may\nadversely affect the yield on loans or\nsecurities held by us, amounts paid on\nour securities and received and paid on\nderivatives we have entered into, the\nvalue of such loans, securities or\nderivative instruments, the trading\nmarket for such products and contracts,\nand our effective use of hedging\ninstruments to manage risk. There is no\nassurance that impacted benchmarks will\ntransition to ARRs without delay or\npotential disputes.\n\nThe transition of any products using\nimpacted benchmarks (Impacted Products)\nthat do not include fallback provisions\nor adequate fallback mechanisms may\nrequire additional efforts to modify\ntheir terms, and may be more challenging\nto modify if all\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America20                                                               \n                                                                                  \nimpacted parties are required to consent\nto such modification. Litigation or\nother disputes may occur as a result of\nthe interpretation or application of any\ntransition-related legislation or\nregulations adopted in the U.S. and/or\nforeign jurisdictions, including if the\nlaws or regulations in jurisdictions\noverlap.\n\nImpacted Products may contain language\ngiving the Corporation discretion to\ndetermine the successor rate (including\nthe applicable spread adjustment) to the\nexisting benchmark. We may face a risk\nof litigation, disputes or other actions\nfrom customers, counterparties,\ninvestors or others based on various\nclaims, for example, that we incorrectly\ninterpreted or enforced contract\nprovisions, failed to appropriately\ncommunicate the transition effects of\nARRs to existing and future products,\ntreated affected parties unfairly or\nmade inappropriate product\nrecommendations to or investments on\nbehalf of our clients, engaged in anti-\ncompetitive behavior or unlawfully\nmanipulated markets or benchmarks.\n\nARR-based products that we develop,\nlaunch and/or support may perform\ndifferently from Impacted Products\nduring times of economic stress, adverse\nor volatile market conditions and across\nthe credit and economic cycle, which may\nimpact the value, return on and\nprofitability of our ARR-based assets.\nNew financial products linked to ARRs\nmay have additional legal, financial,\naccounting, tax, operational, market,\ncompliance, reputational, competitive or\nother risks to us, our customers and\nother market participants. Scrutiny by\nbanking regulators in the U.S. and\nglobally on transition plans,\npreparations and readiness could result\nin regulatory action, litigation and/or\nthe need to change the products offered\nby our businesses.\n\nWe face significant and increasing\ncompetition in the financial services\nindustry.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and experience intense\ncompetition from local and global bank\nand nonbank financial institutions and\nnew entrants in domestic and foreign\nmarkets. There is increasing pressure to\nprovide products and services on more\nattractive terms, including lower fees\nand higher interest rates on deposits,\nand lower cost investment strategies,\nwhich may impact our ability to\neffectively compete. The current and\nchanging regulatory environment may also\ncreate competitive disadvantages,\nincluding from more stringent regulatory\nrequirements applicable to the\nCorporation.\n\nEmerging technologies and the growth of\ne-commerce have lowered geographic and\nmonetary barriers of other financial\ninstitutions, made it easier for non-\ndepository institutions to offer\ntraditional banking products and\nservices and allowed non-traditional\nfinancial service providers and\ntechnology companies to compete with\ntraditional financial service companies\nin providing electronic and internet-\nbased financial solutions and services,\nincluding electronic securities trading\nwith low or no fees and commissions,\nmarketplace lending, financial data\naggregation and payment processing\nservices, including real-time payment\nplatforms. Further, clients may choose\nto conduct business with other market\nparticipants who engage in business or\noffer products in areas we deem\nspeculative or risky as an alternative\nto traditional banking products.\nIncreased competition may reduce our\nmarket share, net interest margin and\nrevenues from our fee-based products and\nservices and negatively affect our\nearnings, including by pressuring us to\nlower pricing or credit standards,\nrequiring additional investment to\nimprove the quality and delivery of our\ntechnology and/or affecting the\nwillingness of our clients to do\nbusiness with us.\n\nOur inability to adapt our business\nstrategies, products and services could\nharm our business.\n\nWe rely on a diversified mix of\nbusinesses that deliver a broad range of\nfinancial products and services through\nmultiple\n\ndistribution channels. Our success\ndepends on our and our third-party\nproviders\u2019 ability to timely adapt our\nbusiness strategies, products and\nservices and their respective features,\nincluding available payment processing\nservices and technology to rapidly\nevolving industry standards and consumer\npreferences. Our strategies could be\nfurther impacted by macroeconomic\nstress, widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, cyberattacks, and military\nconflicts or other significant\ngeopolitical events.\n\nThe widespread adoption and rapid\nevolution of emerging technologies,\nincluding analytic capabilities, self-\nservice digital trading platforms and\nautomated trading markets, internet\nservices, and digital assets, such as\ncentral bank digital currencies,\ncryptocurrencies (including\nstablecoins), tokens and other\ncryptoassets that utilize distributed\nledger technology (DLT), as well as\npayment, clearing and settlement\nprocesses that use DLT, create\nadditional strategic risks, could\nnegatively impact our ability to compete\nand require substantial expenditures to\nthe extent we were to modify or adapt\nour existing products and services. As\nsuch new technologies evolve and mature,\nour businesses and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted, including\nas a result of the introduction of new\ncompetitors to the payment ecosystem and\nincreased volatility in deposits and/or\nsignificant long-term reduction in\ndeposits (i.e., financial\ndisintermediation). Also, we may not be\nas timely or successful in accurately\nassessing the competitive landscape and\ndeveloping or introducing new products\nand services, integrating new products\nor services into our existing offerings,\nresponding, managing or adapting to\nchanges in consumer behavior,\npreferences, spending, investing and/or\nsaving habits, achieving market\nacceptance of our products and services,\nreducing costs in response to pressures\nto deliver products and services at\nlower prices or sufficiently developing\nand maintaining customers. Our or our\nthird-party providers\u2019 inability or\nresistance to timely innovate or adapt\nits operations, products and services to\nevolving regulatory and market\nenvironments, industry standards and\nconsumer preferences could result in\nservice disruptions and harm our\nbusiness and adversely affect our\nresults of operations and reputation.\n\nWe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial harm if our\nmodels fail to properly anticipate and\nmanage risk.\n\nWe use models extensively to forecast\nlosses, project revenue and expenses,\nassess and control our operations and\nfinancial condition, assist in capital\nplanning, manage liquidity and measure,\nforecast and assess capital and\nliquidity requirements for credit,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks.\nUnder our Enterprise Model Risk Policy,\nModel Risk Management is required to\nperform model oversight, including\nindependent validation before initial\nuse, ongoing monitoring reviews through\noutcomes analysis and benchmarking, and\nperiodic revalidation. However, models\nare subject to inherent limitations from\nsimplifying assumptions, uncertainty\nregarding economic and financial\noutcomes, and emerging risks from\napplications that rely on AI or machine\nlearning.\n\nOur models may not be sufficiently\npredictive of future results due to\nlimited historical patterns, extreme or\nunanticipated market movements or\ncustomer behavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe market\ndownturns or stress events (e.g.,\ngeopolitical or pandemic events), which\ncould limit their effectiveness and\nrequire timely recalibration. The models\nthat we use to assess and control our\nmarket risk exposures also reflect\nassumptions about the degree of\ncorrelation among prices of various\nasset classes or other market\nindicators, which may not be\nrepresentative of the next downturn and\nwould magnify the limitations inherent\nin using historical data to\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmanage risk. Market conditions in recent\nyears have involved unprecedented\ndislocations and highlight the\nlimitations inherent in using historical\ndata to manage risk. Our models may also\nbe adversely impacted by human error and\nmay not be effective if we fail to\nproperly oversee and review them at\nregular intervals and detect their flaws\nduring our review and monitoring\nprocesses, they contain erroneous data,\nassumptions, valuations, formulas or\nalgorithms or our applications running\nthe models do not perform as expected.\nRegardless of the steps we take to help\nconfirm effective controls, governance,\nmonitoring and testing, and implement\nnew technology and automated processes,\nwe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial harm,\nincluding funding or liquidity\nshortfalls, if models fail to properly\nanticipate and manage risks.\n\nFailure to properly manage data may\nresult in our inability to manage risk\nand business needs, errors in our\noperations, critical reporting and\nstrategic decision-making, inaccurate\nreporting and non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations.\n\nWe rely on our ability to manage and\nprocess data in an accurate, timely and\ncomplete manner, including capturing,\ntransporting, aggregating, using,\ntransmitting data externally, and\nretaining and protecting data\nappropriately. While we continually\nupdate our policies, programs, processes\nand practices and implement emerging\ntechnologies, such as automation, AI,\nmachine learning and robotics, our data\nmanagement processes may not be\neffective and are subject to weaknesses\nand failures, including human error,\ndata limitations, process delays, system\nfailure or failed controls. Failure to\nproperly manage data effectively in an\naccurate, timely and complete manner may\nadversely impact its quality and\nreliability and our ability to manage\ncurrent and emerging risk, produce\naccurate financial and/or nonfinancial,\nregulatory, operational and ESG\nreporting, detect or surveil potential\nmisconduct or non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations, and to manage\nchanging business needs, strategic\ndecision-making, resolution strategy and\noperations. The failure to establish and\nmaintain effective, efficient and\ncontrolled data management could\nadversely impact our ability to develop\nour products and relationships with\ncustomers, increase regulatory risk and\noperational losses, and damage our\nreputation.\n\nOur operations, businesses and customers\ncould be adversely affected by the\nimpacts related to climate change.\n\nClimate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters present short-\nterm and long-term risks. The physical\nrisks include an increase in the\nfrequency and severity of extreme\nweather events and natural disasters,\nincluding floods, wildfires, hurricanes\nand tornados, and chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels. Such\ndisasters and effects could adversely\nimpact our facilities, employees and\ncustomers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding\nloans, disrupt the operations of us and\nour customers or third parties, cause\nsupply chain or distribution network\ndisruptions, damage collateral and/or\nresult in market volatility, rapid\ndeposit outflows or drawdowns of credit\nfacilities, the deterioration of the\nvalue of collateral or insurance\nshortfalls.\n\nThere is also increasing risk related to\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\nChanges in consumer preferences or\nfinancial condition of our customers and\ncounterparties, market pressures,\nadvancements in technology and\nadditional legislation, regulatory,\ncompliance and legal requirements could\nalter our strategic planning and the\nscope of our existing businesses, limit\nour ability to pursue certain business\nactivities and offer certain products\nand services, amplify credit and market\nrisks, negatively impact asset values,\nrequire capital expenditures and changes\nin technology and markets, including\n\nsupply chain and insurance availability\nand cost, increase expenses, impact\ncapital requirements and adversely\nimpact our results of operations. In\nparticular, there is an increasing\nglobal regulatory focus, including\nstate, federal and non-U.S.\njurisdictions, on climate change\nresulting in new or heightened\nregulatory requirements, with potential\njurisdictional divergence, which is\nexpected to increase our legal,\ncompliance and public disclosure risks\nand costs in the U.S. and globally.\n\nOur climate change strategies, policies,\nand disclosures, our ability to achieve\nour climate-related goals, targets and\ncommitments and/or the environmental or\nclimate impacts attributable to our\nproducts, services or transactions will\nlikely result in heightened legal and\ncompliance risk and could result in\nreputational harm as a result of\nnegative public sentiment, regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation and reduced\ninvestor and stakeholder confidence. Due\nto divergent views of stakeholders, we\nare at increased risk that any action,\nor lack thereof, by us concerning our\nresponse to climate change will be\nperceived negatively by some\nstakeholders, which could adversely\nimpact our reputation and businesses.\nOur ability to meet our climate-related\ngoals, targets and commitments,\nincluding our goal to achieve certain\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets\nby 2030 and net zero GHG emissions in\nour financing activities, operations and\nsupply chain before 2050, is subject to\nrisks and uncertainties, many of which\nare outside of our control, such as\ntechnological advances, clearly defined\nroadmaps for industry sectors, public\npolicies and better emissions data\nreporting, and ongoing engagement with\ncustomers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders. Due to the evolving nature\nof climate-related risks, which are\nexpected to increase over time, it is\ndifficult to predict, identify, monitor\nand effectively mitigate climate-related\nrisks and uncertainties.\n\nFurthermore, there are and will continue\nto be challenges related to the\navailability and capturing, measuring,\nverifying, analyzing and disclosing\nclimate-related data, including data\nobtained from third parties, which may\nresult in legal, compliance and/or\nreputational harm.\n\nOur ability to attract, develop and\nretain qualified employees is critical\nto our success, business prospects and\ncompetitive position.\n\nOur performance and competitive position\nis heavily dependent on the talents,\ndevelopment and efforts of highly\nskilled individuals. Competition for\nqualified personnel is intense from\nwithin and outside the financial\nservices industry.\n\nOur competitors include global\ninstitutions and institutions subject to\ndifferent compensation and hiring\nregulations than those imposed on U.S.\ninstitutions and financial institutions.\nAlso, our ability to attract, develop\nand retain employees could be impacted\nby changing workforce concerns,\nexpectations, practices and preferences\n(including remote work), and increasing\nlabor shortages and competition for\nlabor, which could increase labor costs.\n\nIn order to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel, we must provide market-level\ncompensation. As a large financial and\nbanking institution, we are and may\nbecome subject to additional limitations\non compensation practices by the Federal\nReserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other\nregulators globally, which may or may\nnot affect our competitors.

The following\nhighlights the significant changes. \u25cf\nService charges decreased $721 million\nprimarily driven by the impact of non-\nsufficient funds and overdraft policy\nchanges, as well as lower treasury\nservice charges. \u25cf Investment and\nbrokerage services decreased $338\nmillion primarily due to lower\ntransactional revenue and asset\nmanagement fees driven by declines in\nassets under management (AUM) pricing,\nas well as lower average market\nvaluations, partially offset by the\nimpact of positive AUM flows. \u25cf\nInvestment banking fees decreased $115\nmillion primarily due to lower advisory\nand debt issuance fees, partially offset\nby higher equity issuance fees. \u25cf Market\nmaking and similar activities increased\n$657 million primarily driven by\nimproved trading in mortgage products in\nFixed Income, Currencies and Commodities\n(FICC) and by the impact of higher\ninterest rates on client financing\nactivities in Equities, partially offset\nby the net $1.6 billion impact of BSBY\u2019s\nfuture cessation. \u25cf Other income\ndecreased $292 million primarily due to\nhigher partnership losses on tax-\nadvantaged investments and losses on\nsales of available-for-sale (AFS) debt\nsecurities, partially offset by certain\nnegative valuation adjustments in the\nprior year.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses The\nprovision for credit losses increased\n$1.9 billion to $4.4 billion in 2023\ncompared to 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for 2023 was driven by our\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\ncredit card loan growth and asset\nquality, partially offset by improved\nmacroeconomic conditions that primarily\nbenefited our commercial portfolio. For\nthe same period in the prior year, the\nprovision for credit losses was\nprimarily driven by loan growth and a\ndampened macroeconomic outlook,\npartially offset by a reduction in\nCOVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used\n\nby other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nnet interest income on an FTE basis is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure. To derive\nthe FTE basis, net interest income is\nadjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on\nan equivalent before-tax basis with a\ncorresponding increase in income tax\nexpense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 85.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

We utilize a\nmethodology that considers the effect of\nregulatory capital requirements in\naddition to internal risk-based capital\nmodels. Our internal risk-based capital\nmodels use a risk-adjusted methodology\nincorporating each segment\u2019s credit,\nmarket, interest rate, business and\noperational risk components. For more\ninformation on the nature of these\nrisks, see Managing Risk on page 44. The\ncapital allocated to the business\nsegments is referred to as allocated\ncapital. Allocated equity in the\nreporting units is comprised of\nallocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting\nunit.

The operating margin was 25\npercent compared to 28 percent a year\nago.\n\nNet interest income decreased $319\nmillion to $7.1 billion primarily driven\nby lower average deposit balances and a\nportfolio mix shift to higher yielding\ndeposit products.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily\nincludes investment and brokerage\nservices income, decreased $324 million\nto $14.0 billion. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by lower transactional\nrevenue and asset management fees driven\nby declines in AUM\n\npricing as well as lower average market\nvaluations, partially offset by the\nimpact of positive AUM flows.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $346\nmillion to $15.8 billion primarily due\nto continued investments in the\nbusiness, including strategic hiring and\ntechnology, as well as higher FDIC\nexpense, partially offset by lower\nrevenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 21 percent, down from 27 percent,\ndue to lower net income and, to a lesser\nextent, a small increase in allocated\ncapital.\n\nAverage loans totaled $219.5 billion,\nrelatively unchanged from the same\nperiod a year ago. Average deposits\ndecreased $53.0 billion to $298.3\nbillion primarily driven by clients\nmoving deposits to higher yielding\ninvestment cash alternatives, including\nofferings on our investment and\nbrokerage platforms.\n\nMerrill Wealth Management revenue of\n$17.5 billion decreased four percent\nprimarily driven by lower net interest\nincome, lower transactional revenue and\nasset management fees driven by declines\nin AUM pricing as well as lower average\nmarket valuations, partially offset by\nthe impact of positive AUM flows.\n\nBank of America Private Bank revenue of\n$3.6 billion increased one percent\nprimarily driven by higher net interest\nincome as well as higher asset\nmanagement fees driven by the impact of\npositive AUM flows.\n                                                                                  \n  37Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                            \n  Key Indicators and Metrics                                                \n  (Dollars in millions)                                                     \n  Revenue by Business                                 2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Merrill Wealth Management                   $     17,461    $     18,135  \n  Bank of America Private Bank                       3,644           3,613  \n  Total revenue, net of interest expense      $     21,105    $     21,748  \n  Client Balances by Business, at year end                                  \n  Merrill Wealth Management                   $  3,182,735    $  2,822,910  \n  Bank of America Private Bank                     606,639         563,931  \n  Total client balances                       $  3,789,374    $  3,386,841  \n  Client Balances by Type, at year end                                      \n  Assets under management                     $  1,617,740    $  1,401,474  \n  Brokerage and other assets                     1,688,923       1,482,025  \n  Deposits                                         299,657         323,899  \n  Loans and leases(1)                              222,287         226,973  \n  Less: Managed deposits in assets under           -39,233         -47,530  \n  management                                                                \n  Total client balances                       $  3,789,374    $  3,386,841  \n  Assets Under Management Rollforward                                       \n  Assets under management, beginning of       $  1,401,474    $  1,638,782  \n  year                                                                      \n  Net client flows                                  52,227          20,785  \n  Market valuation/other                           164,039        -258,093  \n  Total assets under management, end of       $  1,617,740    $  1,401,474  \n  year                                                                      \n  Total wealth advisors, at year end(2)             18,916          19,273  \n                                                                            \n(1) Includes margin receivables which are classified in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(2) Includes advisors across all wealth management businesses in GWIM and Consumer\nBanking.\n                                                                                  \n  Client Balances                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nClient balances managed under advisory\nand/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and\nare typically held in diversified\nportfolios.

The increase in\nclient balances was primarily due to the\nimpact of higher end-of-period market\nvaluations and positive net client\nflows.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America38                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Global Banking                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (Dollars in millions)                2023             2022       % Change       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net interest income            $   14,645       $   12,184             20  %    \n  Noninterest income:                                                             \n  Service charges                     2,952            3,293            -10       \n  Investment banking fees             2,819            3,004             -6       \n  All other income                    4,380            3,748             17       \n  Total noninterest income           10,151           10,045              1       \n  Total revenue, net of              24,796           22,229             12       \n  interest expense                                                                \n  Provision for credit losses          -586              641                 n/m  \n  Noninterest expense                11,344           10,966              3       \n  Income before income taxes         14,038           10,622             32       \n  Income tax expense                  3,790            2,815             35       \n  Net income                     $   10,248       $    7,807             31       \n  Effective tax rate                   27.0  %          26.5  %                   \n  Net interest yield                   2.73             2.26                      \n  Return on average allocated            21               18                      \n  capital                                                                         \n  Efficiency ratio                    45.75            49.34                      \n  Balance Sheet                                                                   \n  Average                                                                         \n  Total loans and leases         $  378,762       $  375,271              1  %    \n  Total earning assets              535,500          539,032             -1       \n  Total assets                      602,579          603,273                 \u2014    \n  Total deposits                    505,627          511,804             -1       \n  Allocated capital                  49,250           44,500             11       \n  Year end                                                                        \n  Total loans and leases         $  373,891       $  379,107             -1  %    \n  Total earning assets              552,453          522,539              6       \n  Total assets                      621,751          588,466              6       \n  Total deposits                    527,060          498,661              6       \n                                                                                  \nn/m = not meaningful\nGlobal Banking , which includes Global\nCorporate Banking, Global Commercial\nBanking, Business Banking and Global\nInvestment Banking, provides a wide\nrange of lending-related products and\nservices, integrated working capital\nmanagement and treasury solutions, and\nunderwriting and advisory services\nthrough our network of offices and\nclient relationship teams.

These increases were primarily\ndriven by higher revenue in FICC.\nNoninterest expense increased $786\nmillion to $13.2 billion, primarily\ndriven by continued investments in the\nbusiness, including people and\ntechnology, partially offset by expenses\nrecognized for certain regulatory\nmatters in the prior-year period.\n\nAverage total assets increased $12.1\nbillion to $869.8 billion, driven by\nhigher levels of inventory, increased\nsecured\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nfinancing activity and loan growth in FICC, partially offset by lower levels of\ninventory in Equities.

Average\nallocated assets were $975.9 billion and\n$1.1 trillion for 2023 and 2022 and\nyear-end allocated assets were $972.9\nbillion and $1.0 trillion at December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n\nAll Other primarily consists of asset\nand liability management (ALM)\nactivities, liquidating businesses and\ncertain expenses not otherwise allocated\nto a business segment. ALM activities\nencompass interest rate and foreign\ncurrency risk management activities for\nwhich substantially all of the results\nare allocated to our business segments.\nFor more information on our ALM\nactivities, see Note 23 \u2013 Business\nSegment Information to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nThe net loss in All Other increased $2.3\nbillion to $4.0 billion primarily due to\nlower noninterest income and higher\nnoninterest expense, partially offset by\na higher income tax benefit.\n\nNoninterest income decreased $3.2\nbillion primarily due to a net charge\nincurred as a result of the impact of\nBSBY\u2019s future cessation, higher\npartnership losses for tax-advantaged\ninvestments and losses on sales of AFS\ndebt securities. The announcement of\nBSBY\u2019s future cessation resulted in a\n$1.6 billion net charge due to the\nCorporation\u2019s determination that certain\nforecasted BSBY-indexed interest\npayments, which had been designated in\ncash flow hedges, were no longer\nexpected to occur beyond November 15,\n2024 as they will transition to a new\nreference rate. Accordingly, during the\nfourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation\nreclassified the fair value of the\ninterest\n\nrate swaps used in the cash flow hedges\nrelated to these forecasted transactions\nfrom accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (OCI) into noninterest income.\nThe Corporation also recognized\nsubsequent fair value changes of the\ninterest rate swaps into noninterest\nincome until they were re-designated\ninto new cash flow hedges.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.6\nbillion primarily due to an accrual of\n$2.1 billion for the estimated amount of\nthe FDIC special assessment resulting\nfrom the closure of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank, as well as higher\ncosts related to a liquidating business\nactivity in the current year, partially\noffset by higher litigation expense in\nthe prior year.\n\nThe income tax benefit was $8.4 billion\nin 2023 compared to a benefit of $6.0\nbillion in 2022. The income tax benefit\nin All Other resulted from both periods\nhaving income tax benefit adjustments to\nallocate the FTE treatment of certain\ntax credits to Global Banking and Global\nMarkets. The increase in the income tax\nbenefit in 2023 was primarily due to the\nbenefit recorded against pretax charges\nfor the FDIC special assessment and\nimpact of BSBY\u2019s future cessation, as\nwell as higher income tax credits\nrelated to tax-advantaged investment\nactivity.\n                                                                                  \n  43Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Managing Risk                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nRisk is inherent in all our business\nactivities. Sound risk management\nenables us to serve our customers and\ndeliver for our shareholders. If not\nmanaged well, risk can result in\nfinancial loss, regulatory sanctions and\npenalties, and damage to our reputation,\neach of which may adversely impact our\nability to execute our business\nstrategies. We take a comprehensive\napproach to risk management with a\ndefined Risk Framework and an\narticulated Risk Appetite Statement,\nwhich are approved annually by the\nEnterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the\nBoard.\n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the\nCorporation are strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational.\n\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current\nor projected financial condition arising\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate.\n\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss\narising from the inability or failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its\nobligations.\n\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes\nin market conditions adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nMarket risk is composed of price risk\nand interest rate risk.\n\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to\nmeet expected or unexpected cash flow\nand collateral needs while continuing to\nsupport our businesses and customers\nunder a range of economic conditions.\n\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal\nor regulatory sanctions, material\nfinancial loss or damage to the\nreputation of the Corporation arising\nfrom the failure of the Corporation to\ncomply with the requirements of\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nand our internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems, people or\nexternal events.\n\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations.\n\nThe following sections address in more\ndetail the specific procedures, measures\nand analyses of the major categories of\nrisk.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a\nculture of managing risk well is\nfundamental to our values and our\npurpose, and how we drive Responsible\nGrowth. It requires us to focus on risk\nin all activities and encourages the\nnecessary mindset and behavior to enable\neffective risk management and promote\nsound risk-taking within our risk\nappetite. Sustaining a culture of\nmanaging risk well throughout the\norganization is critical to the success\nof the Corporation and is a clear\nexpectation of our executive management\nteam and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with\nBoard oversight, the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business. Management\nreviews and approves the strategic and\nfinancial operating plans, as well as\nthe capital plan and Risk Appetite\nStatement, and recommends them annually\nto the Board for approval. Our strategic\nplan takes into consideration return\nobjectives and financial resources,\nwhich must align with risk capacity and\nrisk appetite. Management sets financial\nobjectives for each business by\nallocating capital and setting a target\nfor return on capital for each business.\nCapital allocations are regularly\nevaluated as part of our overall\ngovernance processes as the businesses\nand the economic environment in which we\noperate continue to evolve. For more\ninformation regarding capital\nallocations, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 34.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite\nindicates the amount of capital,\nearnings or liquidity we are willing to\nput at risk to achieve our strategic\nobjectives and business plans,\nconsistent with applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Our risk appetite provides\na common framework that includes a set\nof measures to assist senior management\nand the Board in assessing the\nCorporation\u2019s risk profile across all\nrisk types against our risk appetite and\nrisk capacity. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is\nlimited; therefore, we prioritize the\nrisks we take in order to maintain a\nstrong and flexible financial position\nso we can weather challenging economic\ntimes and take advantage of organic\ngrowth opportunities. Therefore, we set\nobjectives and targets for capital and\nliquidity that are intended to permit us\nto continue to operate in a safe and\nsound manner at all times, including\nduring periods of stress. We also\nmaintain operational risk management and\noperational resiliency capabilities\ndesigned to permit us to meet the\nexpectations of our customers and\nclients through a range of operating\nconditions.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk\nlimits that align with the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk appetite. Senior management is\nresponsible for tracking and reporting\nperformance measurements as well as any\nexceptions to risk appetite limits. The\nBoard, and its committees when\nappropriate, oversee financial\nperformance, execution of the strategic\nand financial operating plans, adherence\nto risk appetite limits and the adequacy\nof internal controls.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our\nrisk management activities, see the\ndiscussion below and pages 47 through\n82.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Governance                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework describes delegations\nof authority whereby the Board and its\ncommittees may delegate authority to\nmanagement-level committees or executive\nofficers. Such delegations may authorize\ncertain decision-making and approval\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in\ndocuments such as committee charters,\njob descriptions, meeting minutes and\nresolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the\ninterrelationship among the Board, Board\ncommittees and management committees\nthat have the majority of risk oversight\nresponsibilities for the Corporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America44                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Board of Directors and Board Committees                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Board is composed of 15 directors,\nall but one of whom are independent. The\nBoard authorizes management to maintain\nan effective Risk Framework and oversees\ncompliance with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, the Board or its\ncommittees conduct inquiries of, and\nreceive reports from senior management\non, risk-related matters to assess scope\nor resource limitations that could\nimpede the ability of Global Risk\nManagement (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit\nto execute its responsibilities. The\nBoard committees discussed below have\nthe principal responsibility for\nenterprise-wide oversight of our risk\nmanagement activities. Through these\nactivities, the Board and applicable\ncommittees are provided with information\non our risk profile and oversee senior\nmanagement addressing key risks we face.\nOther Board committees, as described\nbelow, provide additional oversight of\nspecific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the\nabove chart regularly reports to the\nBoard on risk-related matters within the\ncommittee\u2019s responsibilities, which is\nintended to collectively provide the\nBoard with integrated insight about our\nmanagement of enterprise-wide risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Audit Committee                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Audit Committee oversees the\nqualifications, performance and\nindependence of the Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, the\nperformance of our corporate audit\nfunction, the integrity of our\nconsolidated financial statements, our\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, and makes inquiries of\nsenior management or the Chief Audit\nExecutive (CAE) to determine whether\nthere are scope or resource limitations\nthat impede the ability of Corporate\nAudit to execute its responsibilities.\nThe Audit Committee is also responsible\nfor overseeing compliance risks pursuant\nto the New York Stock Exchange listing\nstandards.\n                                                                                  \n  Enterprise Risk Committee                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe ERC oversees the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, risk appetite and senior\nmanagement\u2019s responsibilities for the\nidentification, measurement, monitoring\nand control of key risks facing the\nCorporation.

Our primary management risk\ncommittee is the MRC. Subject to Board\noversight, the MRC is responsible for\nmanagement oversight of key risks facing\nthe Corporation, including an integrated\nevaluation of risk, earnings, capital\nand liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  Lines of Defense                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe have clear ownership and\naccountability for managing risk across\nthree lines of defense: Front Line Units\n(FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also\nhave control functions outside of FLUs\nand GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human\nResources). The three lines of defense\nare integrated into our management-level\ngovernance structure. Each of these\nfunctional roles is further described in\nthis section.\n                                                                                  \n  Executive Officers                                                              \n                                                                                  \nExecutive officers lead various\nfunctions representing the functional\nroles. Authority for functional roles\nmay be delegated to executive officers\nfrom the Board, Board committees or\nmanagement-level committees. Executive\nofficers, in turn, may further delegate\nresponsibilities, as appropriate, to\nmanagement-level committees, management\nroutines or\n                                                                                  \n  45Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nindividuals. Executive officers review\nour activities for consistency with our\nRisk Framework, risk appetite, and\napplicable strategic, capital and\nfinancial operating plans, as well as\napplicable policies and standards.\nExecutive officers and other employees\nmake decisions individually on a day-to-\nday basis, consistent with the authority\nthey have been delegated. Executive\nofficers and other employees may also\nserve on committees and participate in\ncommittee decisions.\n                                                                                  \n  Front Line Units                                                                \n                                                                                  \nFLUs, which include the lines of\nbusiness as well as Global Technology\nand Global Operations, are responsible\nfor appropriately assessing and\neffectively managing all of the risks\nassociated with their activities.\n\nThree organizational units that include\nFLU activities and control function\nactivities, but are not part of GRM are\n(1) the Chief Financial Officer Group;\n(2) the Chief Administrative Officer\nGroup; and (3) Global Strategy and\nEnterprise Platforms.\n                                                                                  \n   Global Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \nGRM is part of our control functions and\noperates as our independent risk\nmanagement function. GRM, led by the\nChief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible\nfor independently assessing and\noverseeing risks within FLUs and other\ncontrol functions. GRM establishes\nwritten enterprise policies and\nprocedures outlining how aggregate risks\nare identified, measured, monitored and\ncontrolled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and\nindependence needed to develop and\nimplement a meaningful risk management\nframework and practices to guide the\nCorporation in managing risk. The CRO\nhas unrestricted access to the Board and\nreports directly to both the ERC and the\nCEO. GRM is organized into horizontal\nrisk teams that cover a specific risk\narea and vertical CRO teams that cover a\nparticular FLU or control function.\nThese teams work collaboratively in\nexecuting their respective duties.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporate Audit                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain\ntheir independence from the FLUs, GRM\nand other control functions by reporting\ndirectly to the Audit Committee. The CAE\nadministratively reports to the CEO.\nCorporate Audit provides independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key processes and controls\nacross the Corporation. Corporate Audit\nincludes Credit Review, which provides\nan independent assessment of credit\nlending decisions and the effectiveness\nof credit processes across the\nCorporation\u2019s credit platform through\nexaminations and monitoring.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Processes                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework requires that strong\nrisk management practices are integrated\nin key strategic, capital and financial\nplanning processes and in day-to-day\nbusiness processes across the\nCorporation, thereby ensuring risks are\nappropriately considered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely manner. We\nemploy an effective risk management\nprocess, referred to as Identify,\nMeasure, Monitor and Control, as part of\nour daily activities.\n\nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively managed,\nrisks must be proactively identified and\nwell understood. Proper risk\nidentification focuses on recognizing\nand understanding key risks inherent in\nour business activities or key risks\nthat may arise from external factors.\nEach employee is expected to identify\nand escalate risks promptly. Risk\nidentification is an ongoing process\nthat incorporates input from FLUs and\ncontrol\n\nfunctions. It is designed to be forward-\nlooking and to capture relevant risk\nfactors across all of our lines of\nbusiness.\n\nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it\nmust be prioritized and accurately\nmeasured through a systematic process\nincluding qualitative statements and\nquantitative limits. Risk is measured at\nvarious levels, including, but not\nlimited to, risk type, FLU and legal\nentity, and also on an aggregate basis.\nThis risk measurement process helps to\ncapture changes in our risk profile due\nto changes in strategic direction,\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and\nthe overall economic environment. Senior\nmanagement considers how risk exposures\nmight evolve under a variety of stress\nscenarios.\n\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk levels\nregularly to track adherence to risk\nappetite, policies and standards. We\nalso regularly update risk assessments\nand review risk exposures. Through our\nmonitoring, we know our level of risk\nrelative to limits and can take action\nin a timely manner. We also know when\nrisk limits are breached and have\nprocesses to appropriately report and\nescalate exceptions. This includes\ntimely requests for approval to managers\nand alerts to executive management,\nmanagement-level committees or the Board\n(directly or through an appropriate\ncommittee).\n\nControl \u2013 We establish and communicate\nrisk limits and controls through\npolicies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses. The limits and controls can\nbe adjusted by senior management or the\nBoard when conditions or risk tolerances\nwarrant. These limits may be absolute\n(e.g., loan amount, trading volume,\noperational loss) or relative (e.g.,\npercentage of loan book in higher-risk\ncategories). Our FLUs are held\naccountable for performing within the\nestablished limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk\nrepresent a part of our overall risk\nmanagement process. We instill a strong\nand comprehensive culture of managing\nrisk well through communications,\ntraining, policies, procedures and\norganizational roles and\nresponsibilities. Establishing a culture\nreflective of our purpose to help make\nour customers\u2019 financial lives better\nand delivering on Responsible Growth is\nalso critical to effective risk\nmanagement. We are committed to the\nhighest principles of ethical and\nprofessional conduct. Conduct risk is\nthe risk of improper actions, behaviors\nor practices by the Corporation, its\nemployees or representatives that are\nillegal, unethical and/or contrary to\nour core values that could result in\nharm to the Corporation, our\nshareholders or our customers, damage\nthe integrity of the financial markets,\nor negatively impact our reputation. We\nhave established protocols and\nstructures so that conduct risk is\ngoverned and reported across the\nCorporation appropriately. All employees\nare held accountable for adhering to the\nCode of Conduct, operating within our\nrisk appetite and managing risk in their\ndaily business activities. In addition,\nour performance management and\ncompensation practices encourage\nresponsible risk-taking that is\nconsistent with our Risk Framework and\nrisk appetite.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporation-wide Stress Testing                                                 \n                                                                                  \nIntegral to our Capital Planning,\nFinancial Planning and Strategic\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital\nscenario management and stress\nforecasting on a regular basis to better\nunderstand balance sheet, earnings and\ncapital sensitivities to a wide range of\neconomic and business scenarios,\nincluding economic and market conditions\nthat are more severe than anticipated.\nThese stress forecasts provide an\nunderstanding of the potential impacts\nfrom our risk profile on the balance\nsheet, earnings and capital, and serve\nas a key component of our capital and\nrisk management practices. The intent of\nstress testing is to\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndevelop a comprehensive understanding of\npotential impacts of on- and off-balance\nsheet risks at the Corporation and\ncertain subsidiaries and how they impact\nfinancial resiliency, which provides\nconfidence to management, regulators and\nour investors.\n                                                                                  \n  Contingency Planning                                                            \n                                                                                  \nWe have developed and maintain\ncomprehensive contingency plans that are\ndesigned to prepare us in advance to\nrespond in the event of potential\nadverse economic, operational, financial\nor market stress conditions. These\ncontingency plans include our Financial\nContingency and Recovery Plan, which\nprovides monitoring, escalation, actions\nand routines designed to enable us to\nincrease capital and/or liquidity,\naccess funding sources and reduce risk\nthrough consideration of potential\noptions that include asset sales,\nbusiness sales, capital or debt\nissuances, and other risk reducing\nstrategies at various levels of capital\nor liquidity depletion during a period\nof stress. We also maintain a Resolution\nPlan to limit adverse systemic impacts\nthat could be associated with a\npotential resolution of Bank of America.\n                                                                                  \n   Strategic Risk Management                                                      \n                                                                                  \nStrategic risk is embedded in every\nbusiness and is one of the major risk\ncategories along with credit, market,\nliquidity, compliance, operational and\nreputational risks. This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate, such as competitor\nactions, changing customer preferences,\nproduct obsolescence and technology\ndevelopments.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk\nthat the Corporation\u2019s capital levels\nare not adequate to meet minimum\nregulatory requirements and support\nexecution of business activities or\nabsorb losses from risks during normal\nor adverse economic and market\nconditions. As such, capital risk is\nmanaged in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe manage strategic risk through the\nStrategic Risk Enterprise Policy and\nintegration into the strategic planning\nprocess, among other activities. Our\nstrategic plan is consistent with our\nrisk appetite, capital plan and\nliquidity requirements, and specifically\naddresses strategic risks impacting each\nbusiness.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews\nand approves the strategic plan, capital\nplan, financial operating plan and Risk\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by\nthe Board, senior management directs the\nlines of business to execute our\nstrategic plan consistent with our core\noperating principles and risk appetite.\nThe executive management team monitors\nbusiness performance throughout the year\nand provides the Board with regular\nprogress reports on whether strategic\nobjectives and timelines are being met,\nincluding reports on strategic risks and\nif additional or alternative actions\nneed to be considered or implemented.\nThe regular executive reviews focus on\nassessing forecasted earnings and\nreturns on capital, the current risk\nprofile, current capital and liquidity\nrequirements, staffing levels and\nchanges required to support the\nstrategic plan, stress testing results,\nand other qualitative factors such as\nmarket growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as\ncapital actions, material acquisitions\nor divestitures, and resolution plans\nare reviewed and approved by the Board.\nAt the business level, processes are in\nplace to discuss the strategic risk\nimplications of new, expanded or\nmodified businesses, products or\nservices,\n\nregulatory change and other strategic\ninitiatives, and to provide formal\nreview and approval where required. With\noversight by the Board and the ERC,\nexecutive management performs similar\nanalyses throughout the year, and\nevaluates changes to the financial\nforecast or the risk, capital or\nliquidity positions as deemed\nappropriate to balance and optimize\nachieving the targeted risk appetite,\nshareholder returns and maintaining the\ntargeted financial strength. Proprietary\nmodels are used to measure the capital\nrequirements for credit, country,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks.\nThe allocated capital assigned to each\nbusiness is based on its unique risk\nprofile. With oversight by the Board,\nexecutive management assesses the risk-\nadjusted returns of each business in\napproving strategic and financial\noperating plans. The businesses use\nallocated capital to define business\nstrategies, and price products and\ntransactions.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning.\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety\nand soundness at all times, even under\nadverse scenarios, take advantage of\norganic growth opportunities, meet\nobligations to creditors and\ncounterparties, maintain ready access to\nfinancial markets, continue to serve as\na credit intermediary, remain a source\nof strength for our subsidiaries, and\nsatisfy current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements. Capital management\nis integrated into our risk and\ngovernance processes, as capital is a\nkey consideration in the development of\nour strategic plan, risk appetite and\nrisk limits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic\nbasis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking\nassessment of our projected capital\nneeds and resources, incorporating\nearnings, balance sheet and risk\nforecasts under baseline and adverse\neconomic and market conditions. We\nutilize periodic stress tests to assess\nthe potential impacts to our balance\nsheet, earnings, regulatory capital and\nliquidity under a variety of stress\nscenarios. We perform qualitative risk\nassessments to identify and assess\nmaterial risks not fully captured in our\nforecasts or stress tests. We assess the\npotential capital impacts of proposed\nchanges to regulatory capital\nrequirements. Management assesses ICAAP\nresults and provides documented\nquarterly assessments of the adequacy of\nour capital guidelines and capital\nposition to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital\nannually during the strategic and\ncapital planning processes.

Based on 2023\nstress test results, our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) is 2.5 percent effective\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized\nthe Corporation\u2019s $25 billion common\nstock repurchase program (October 2021\nAuthorization). Additionally, the Board\nauthorized common stock repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans. In September 2023, the Board\nmodified the October 2021 Authorization,\neffective\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOctober 1, 2023, to include repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under equity-\nbased compensation plans when\ndetermining the remaining repurchase\nauthority. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorizations, during 2023, we\nrepurchased $4.6 billion of common\nstock, including repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans. As of December 31,\n2023, the remaining repurchase authority\nwas approximately $12.7 billion\n(including repurchases to offset shares\nawarded under equity-based compensation\nplans).\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3\nestablished minimum capital ratios and\nbuffer requirements and outlined two\nmethods of calculating risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), the Standardized approach\nand the Advanced approaches. The\nStandardized approach relies primarily\non supervisory risk weights based on\nexposure type, and the Advanced\napproaches determine risk weights based\non internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nRWA under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the PCA\nframework. As of December 31, 2023, the\ncommon equity tier 1 (CET1) capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios\nunder the Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer\n\nand a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements were 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nand 9.5 percent under the Advanced\napproaches. Effective October 1, 2023\nthrough December 31, 2023, our CET1\nminimum requirement was 9.5 percent\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. Effective January 1, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is\nhigher under Method 2, increased 50 bps,\nresulting in an increase in our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement to 10.0\npercent from 9.5 percent. At December\n31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s CET1 capital\nratio of 11.8 percent under the\nStandardized approach exceeded its CET1\ncapital ratio requirement as well as the\nnew minimum requirement in place as of\nJanuary 1, 2024.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nDecember 31, 2023, our insured\ndepository institution subsidiaries\nexceeded their requirement to maintain a\nminimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered\nwell capitalized under the PCA\nframework. The numerator of the SLR is\nquarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The\ndenominator is total leverage exposure\nbased on the daily average of the sum of\non-balance sheet exposures less\npermitted deductions and the simple\naverage of certain off-balance sheet\nexposures, as of the end of each month\nin a quarter.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios

transition period related to\nthe adoption of the current expected\ncredit losses (CECL) accounting standard\non January 1, 2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum\nis the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches) or the\nSCB of 2.5 percent at December 31, 2023\nand 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022\n(under the Standardized approach), as\napplicable. The countercyclical capital\nbuffer was zero for both periods. The\nSLR regulatory minimum includes a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, CET1 capital was\n$194.9 billion, an increase of $14.9\nbillion from December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital increased $14.9 billion\nprimarily driven by the same factors as\nCET1 capital. Total capital under the\nStandardized approach increased $12.6\nbillion primarily due to the same\nfactors driving the increase in Tier 1\ncapital and an increase in the adjusted\nallowance for credit losses included in\nTier 2 capital, partially offset by a\ndecrease in subordinated debt. RWA\n\nunder the Standardized approach, which\nyielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at\nDecember 31, 2023, increased $46.4\nbillion during 2023 to $1,651 billion\nprimarily due to higher counterparty and\nmarket risk exposures in Global Markets\nand consumer loan growth. Supplementary\nleverage exposure at December 31, 2023\nincreased $152.9 billion primarily due\nto higher cash held at central banks,\npartially offset by lower debt\nsecurities balances.\n

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher\nunder Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting in an increase in our long-term debt\nRWA regulatory minimum requirement to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Developments                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nOn July 27, 2023, U.S. banking\nregulators issued proposed rules that\nwould update future U.S. regulatory\ncapital requirements. Under the capital\nproposal, the Advanced approaches would\nbe replaced with a new standardized\napproach, referred to as the expanded\nrisk-based approach, which would be\nphased in over a three-year period\nbeginning July 1, 2025. U.S. banking\nregulators also issued proposed rules to\nrevise the risk-based capital surcharge\nfor G-SIBs, which would be effective two\ncalendar quarters after finalization. On\nAugust 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators\nissued proposed rules that would change\nthe criteria for debt instruments\nincluded in the Corporation\u2019s eligible\nlong-term debt and TLAC. Any final rules\nissued are subject to change from the\ncurrent proposals. The Corporation is\nevaluating the potential impact of the\nproposed rules on its regulatory\ncapital, eligible long-term debt and\nTLAC requirements.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). On\nAugust 13, 2023, Merrill Lynch\nProfessional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC)\nmerged into its immediate parent, BofAS.\nPrior to that date, MLPCC was a fully-\nguaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and\nprovided clearing and settlement\nservices as well as prime brokerage and\narranged financing services for\ninstitutional clients. Following the\nmerger, client services previously\nprovided by MLPCC are now being provided\nby or through BofAS.\n\nThe Corporation's principal European\nsubsidiaries undertaking broker-dealer\nactivities are Merrill Lynch\nInternational (MLI) and BofA Securities\nEurope SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its capital requirements\nas an alternative net capital broker-\ndealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPF&S\ncomputes its capital requirements in\naccordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered\nas a futures commission merchant and is\nsubject to Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The\nU.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also\nregistered with the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA).\nPursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may\nimpose higher net capital requirements\nthan Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act\nwith respect to each of the broker-\ndealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nDecember 31, 2023, BofAS had tentative\nnet capital of $21.4 billion. BofAS also\nhad regulatory net capital of $19.4\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of $4.6 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nDecember 31, 2023, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $5.8 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $134\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\nis regulated by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the Financial\nConduct Authority and is subject to\ncertain regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2023, MLI\u2019s capital\nresources were $33.9 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $11.4 billion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution\nwith its head office located in France,\nis regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the\nAutorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and\nsupervised under the Single Supervisory\nMechanism by the European Central Bank.\nAt December 31, 2023, BofASE's capital\nresources were $9.6 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $3.6 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became\nconditionally registered with the SEC as\nsecurity-based swap dealers in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, and maintained\nnet liquid assets at December 31, 2023\nthat exceeded the applicable minimum\nrequirements under the Exchange Act.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity Risk                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur primary liquidity risk management\nobjective is to meet expected or\nunexpected cash flow and collateral\nrequirements, including payments under\nlong-term debt agreements, commitments\nto extend credit and customer deposit\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support\nour businesses and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America52                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncustomers under a range of economic\nconditions. To achieve that objective,\nwe analyze and monitor our liquidity\nrisk under expected and stressed\nconditions, maintain liquidity and\naccess to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nstress from increased volatility due to\nthe failure of certain financial\ninstitutions in the first half of 2023.\nOur practices have also allowed us to\neffectively manage market fluctuations\nfrom the rising interest rate\nenvironment, inflationary pressures and\nchanges in the macroeconomic\nenvironment. We define liquidity as\nreadily available assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we can use\nto meet our contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations as they arise. We\nmanage our liquidity position through\nline-of-business and ALM activities, as\nwell as through our legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and current\n(including intraday) basis under both\nexpected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity management\nenhances our ability to monitor\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events. The Board approves\nour liquidity risk policy and the\nFinancial Contingency and Recovery Plan.\nThe ERC establishes our liquidity risk\ntolerance levels. The MRC is responsible\nfor overseeing liquidity risks and\ndirecting management to maintain\nexposures within the established\ntolerance levels. The MRC reviews and\nmonitors our liquidity position and\nstress testing results, approves certain\nliquidity risk limits and reviews the\nimpact of strategic decisions on our\nliquidity. For more information, see\nManaging Risk on page 44. Under this\ngovernance framework, we developed\ncertain funding and liquidity risk\nmanagement practices which include:\nmaintaining liquidity at Bank of America\nCorporation (Parent) and selected\nsubsidiaries, including our bank\nsubsidiaries and other regulated\nentities; determining what amounts of\nliquidity are appropriate for these\nentities based on analysis of debt\nmaturities and other potential cash\noutflows, including those that we may\nexperience during stressed market\nconditions; diversifying funding\nsources, considering our asset profile\nand legal entity structure; and\nperforming contingency planning. NB\nHoldings Corporation The Parent, which\nis a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our bank and nonbank subsidiaries,\nhas an intercompany arrangement with our\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).\nWe have transferred, and agreed to\ntransfer, additional Parent assets not\nrequired to satisfy anticipated near-\nterm expenditures to NB Holdings. The\nParent is expected to continue to have\naccess to the same flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts of cash\nnecessary to service its debt, pay\ndividends and perform other obligations\nas it would have had it not entered into\nthese arrangements and transferred any\nassets. These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. In consideration\nfor the transfer of assets, NB Holdings\nissued a subordinated note to the Parent\nin a principal amount equal to the value\nof the transferred assets. The aggregate\nprincipal amount of the note will\nincrease by the amount of any future\nasset transfers. NB Holdings also\nprovided the Parent with a committed\nline of credit that allows the Parent to\ndraw\n\nfunds necessary to service near-term\ncash needs. These arrangements support\nour preferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements\ninclude provisions to terminate the line\nof credit, forgive the subordinated note\nand require the Parent to transfer its\nremaining financial assets to NB\nHoldings if our projected liquidity\nresources deteriorate so severely that\nresolution of the Parent becomes\nimminent. Global Liquidity Sources and\nOther Unencumbered Assets We maintain\nliquidity available to the Corporation,\nincluding the Parent and selected\nsubsidiaries, in the form of cash and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Our liquidity buffer,\nreferred to as Global Liquidity Sources\n(GLS), is comprised of assets that are\nreadily available to the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, including holding\ncompany, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash is primarily\non deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent, central banks\noutside of the U.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency MBS and other\ninvestment-grade securities, and a\nselect group of non-U.S. government\nsecurities. We can obtain cash for these\nsecurities, even in stressed conditions,\nthrough repurchase agreements or\noutright sales. We hold our GLS in legal\nentities that allow us to meet the\nliquidity requirements of our global\nbusinesses, and we consider the impact\nof potential regulatory, tax, legal and\nother restrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 15                                         Three Months Ended             \n  (Dollars in            Average Global                   December 31             \n  billions)              Liquidity Sources                       2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                               $                   735    $   694  \n  Nonbank and other                                               162        174  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                            $                   897    $   868  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained by borrowing\nagainst this pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was $312\nbillion and $348 billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof\n                                                                                  \n  53Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nbroker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily\navailable to meet the obligations of\nthat entity, and transfers to the Parent\nor to any other subsidiary may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval due\nto regulatory restrictions and minimum\nrequirements.

However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $590 billion and $605 billion for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the same periods, the average\nconsolidated LCR was 115 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal\nbusiness flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize\nliquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of\nliquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and\nutilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including\npotential credit rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more\nsevere events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on\nour historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial\ninstitutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our\nscenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of\nunsecured debt a nd reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured\nfinancing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan\ncommitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral\nthat counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral\nand margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity\nrequired to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in\ncertain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades,\ncould negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the\nrelated financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material\nto our financial results.\n\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario\nand focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity\nrequirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage\nour asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain\nfunding sources and businesses. Net Stable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding\nRatio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum\nlevel of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to\nsupport the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal\nand adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on\nshort-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the average consolidated\nNSFR was 119 percent and 120 percent. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our\nassets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities\nthrough a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across\nproducts, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits\nof our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding\ncosts, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the\nvariable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone\ndifferences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical,\ncertain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion\nof our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.92 trillion and\n$1.93 trillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022 . Deposits are primarily generated by\nour Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are\ndiversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S.\ndeposits are insured by the FDIC. At December 31, 2023, 50 percent of our deposits\nwere in Consumer Banking , 16 percent in GWIM and 27 percent in Global Banking .\nAs of the same period, approximately 68 percent of consumer and small business\ndeposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients\nwho have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, 28 percent and 34 percent of our deposits were noninterest-bearing\nand included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. We\nconsider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and\nconsistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less\nsensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit\nratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be\nfinanced through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and\nsecuritizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our\ntrading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured\nbasis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will\nvary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these\nactivities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less\nsensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase\nagreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured\nfinancing\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmarkets for financial institutions have\noccurred in prior market cycles which\nresulted in adverse changes in terms or\nsignificant reductions in the\navailability of such financing. We\nmanage the liquidity risks arising from\nsecured funding by sourcing funding\nglobally from a diverse group of\ncounterparties, providing a range of\nsecurities collateral and pursuing\nlonger durations, when appropriate. For\nmore information on secured financing\nagreements, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term\nBorrowings, Collateral and Restricted\nCash to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements . Total long-term debt\nincreased $26.2 billion to $302.2\nbillion during 2023, primarily due to\ndebt issuances and valuation\nadjustments, partially offset by debt\nmaturities and redemptions. We may, from\ntime to time, purchase outstanding debt\ninstruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions,\nliquidity and other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also make markets\nin our debt instruments to provide\nliquidity for investors. During 2023, we\nissued $62.0 billion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $24.0 billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which were TLAC\ncompliant, $25.1 billion of notes issued\nby Bank of America, N.A. and $12.9\nbillion of other debt. During 2022, we\nissued $66.0 billion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $44.2 billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which were TLAC\ncompliant, $10.0 billion of notes issued\nby Bank of America, N.A. and $11.8\nbillion of other debt. During 2023, we\nhad total long-term debt maturities and\nredemptions in the aggregate of $42.7\nbillion consisting of $25.3 billion for\nBank of America Corporation, $10.5\nbillion for Bank of America, N.A. and\n$6.9 billion of other debt. During 2022,\nwe had total long-term debt maturities\nand redemptions in the aggregate of\n$33.3 billion consisting of $19.8\nbillion for Bank of America Corporation,\n$9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A.\nand $3.6 billion of other debt. At\nDecember 31, 2023, Bank of America\nCorporation's senior notes of $208.4\nbillion included $187.7 billion of\noutstanding notes that are both TLAC\neligible and callable at least one year\nbefore their stated maturities. Of these\nsenior notes, $22.1 billion will be\ncallable and become TLAC ineligible\nduring 2024, and $22.0 billion, $21.4\nbillion, $25.0 billion and $19.9 billion\nwill do so during each of 2025 through\n2028, respectively, and $77.3 billion\nthereafter. We issue long-term unsecured\ndebt in a variety of maturities and\ncurrencies to achieve cost-efficient\nfunding and to maintain an appropriate\nmaturity profile. While the cost and\navailability of unsecured funding may be\nnegatively impacted by general market\nconditions or by matters specific to the\nfinancial services industry or the\nCorporation, we seek to mitigate\nrefinancing risk by actively managing\nthe amount of our borrowings that we\nanticipate will mature within any month\nor quarter. We may issue unsecured debt\nin the form of structured notes for\nclient purposes, certain of which\nqualify as TLAC- e ligible debt. During\n2023, we issued $15.7 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. We typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to pay on these\nliabilities with derivatives and/or\ninvestments in the underlying\ninstruments, so that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured\nnote obligations for cash or other\nsecurities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\n\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate. Substantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt obligations\ncontain no provisions that could trigger\na requirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements . We use derivative\ntransactions to manage the duration,\ninterest rate and currency risks of our\nborrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Contingency Planning\nWe maintain contingency funding plans\nthat outline our potential responses to\nliquidity stress events at various\nlevels of severity. These policies and\nplans are based on stress scenarios and\ninclude potential funding strategies and\ncommunication and notification\nprocedures that we would implement in\nthe event we experienced stressed\nliquidity conditions. We periodically\nreview and test the contingency funding\nplans to validate efficacy and\n                                                                                  \n  55Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nassess readiness.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access\ncontingency funding through the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. Certain\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries have access to\ncentral bank facilities in the\njurisdictions in which they operate.\nWhile we do not rely on these sources in\nour liquidity modeling, we maintain the\npolicies, procedures and governance\nprocesses that would enable us to access\nthese sources if necessary.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit Ratings                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise\nfunds are impacted by our credit\nratings. In addition, credit ratings may\nbe important to customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and when we seek to\nengage in certain transactions,\nincluding over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives. Thus, it is our objective\nto maintain high-quality credit ratings,\nand management maintains an active\ndialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions\nexpressed by rating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of our\nobligations or securities, including\nlong-term debt, short-term borrowings,\npreferred stock and other securities,\nincluding asset securitizations. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by the rating agencies, and they\nconsider a number of factors, including\nour own financial strength, performance,\nprospect s and operations as well as\nfactors not under our control. The\nrating agencies could make adjustments\nto our ratings at any time, and they\nprovide no assurances that they will\nmaintain our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther factors that influence our credit\nratings include changes to the rating\nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry\nor certain security types; the rating\nagencies\u2019 assessment of the general\noperating environment for financial\nservices companies; our relative\npositions in the markets in which we\ncompete; our various risk exposures and\nrisk management policies and activities;\npending litigation and other\ncontingencies or potential tail risks;\nour reputation; our liquidity position,\ndiversity of\n\nfunding sources and funding costs; the\ncurrent and expected level and\nvolatility of our earnings; our capital\nposition and capital management\npractices; our corporate governance; the\nsovereign credit ratings of the U.S.\ngovernment; current or future regulatory\nand legislative initiatives; and the\nagencies\u2019 views on whether the U.S.\ngovernment would provide meaningful\nsupport to the Corporation or its\nsubsidiaries in a crisis.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService (Moody\u2019s) upgraded its long-term\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nby one notch to A1 from A2, and also\nupgraded the long-term senior debt\nratings of BANA to Aa1 from Aa2. Moody\u2019s\nconcurrently affirmed its Prime-1 short-\nterm ratings of the Corporation and\nBANA. Moody\u2019s cited the Corporation\u2019s\nstrengthened capital, improved earnings\nprofile and ongoing commitment to\nmaintaining a restrained risk appetite\nas rationale for the upgrade. These\nactions concluded the review for upgrade\nthat Moody\u2019s initiated on January 23,\n2023. Separately, on November 13, 2023,\nMoody\u2019s placed its ratings for BANA on\nnegative outlook, reflecting the\nagency\u2019s recent move to a negative\noutlook on its ratings for the\ngovernment of the United States of\nAmerica and the potentially weaker\ncapacity for the government to support\nsystemically important U.S. banks. The\nCorporation\u2019s ratings and stable outlook\nwere not affected by this action.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, Standard & Poor\u2019s\nGlobal Ratings (S&P) affirmed the\ncurrent ratings of the Corporation and\nits subsidiaries, while at the same time\nrevising its rating outlook to Stable\nfrom Positive.

If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our Parent,\nbank or broker-dealer\n\nsubsidiaries were downgraded by one or\nmore levels, the potential loss of\naccess to short-term funding sources\nsuch as repo financing and the effect on\nour incremental cost of funds could be\nmaterial.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nscope of the consequences of a credit\nrating downgrade to a financial\ninstitution is inherently uncertain, as\nit depends upon numerous dynamic,\ncomplex and inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including whether any\ndowngrade of a company\u2019s long-term\ncredit ratings precipitates downgrades\nto its short-term credit ratings, and\nassumptions about the potential\nbehaviors of various customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.

The Corporation\nguarantees the due and punctual payment,\non demand, of amounts payable on the\nGuaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA\nFinance. In addition, each of BAC\nCapital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust\nXIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware\nstatutory trusts (collectively, the\nTrusts) is a 100 percent owned finance\nsubsidiary of the Corporation that has\nissued and sold trust preferred\nsecurities (the Trust Preferred\nSecurities) or capital securities (the\nCapital Securities and, together with\nthe Guaranteed Notes and the Trust\nPreferred Securities, the Guaranteed\nSecurities), as applicable, that\nremained outstanding at December 31,\n2023. The Corporation guarantees the\npayment of amounts and distributions\nwith respect to the Trust Preferred\nSecurities and Capital Securities if not\npaid by the Trusts, to the extent of\nfunds held by the Trusts. This\nguarantee, together with the\nCorporation\u2019s other obligations with\nrespect to the Trust Preferred\nSecurities and Capital Securities,\neffectively constitutes a full and\nunconditional guarantee of the Trusts\u2019\npayment obligations on the Trust\nPreferred Securities or Capital\nSecurities, as applicable. No other\nsubsidiary of the Corporation guarantees\nthe Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA Finance and each of the Trusts are\nfinance subsidiaries, have no\nindependent assets, revenues or\noperations and are dependent upon the\nCorporation and/or the Corporation\u2019s\nother subsidiaries to meet their\nrespective obligations under the\nGuaranteed Securities in the ordinary\ncourse. If holders of the Guaranteed\nSecurities make claims on their\nGuaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy,\nresolution or similar proceeding, any\nrecoveries on those claims will be\nlimited to those available under the\napplicable guarantee by the Corporation,\nas described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and\ndepends upon its subsidiaries for\nliquidity. Applicable laws and\nregulations and intercompany\narrangements entered into in connection\nwith the Corporation\u2019s resolution plan\ncould restrict the availability of funds\nfrom subsidiaries to the Corporation,\nwhich could adversely affect the\nCorporation\u2019s ability to make payments\nunder its guarantees. In addition, the\nobligations of the Corporation under the\nguarantees of the Guaranteed Securities\nwill be structurally subordinated to all\nexisting and future liabilities of its\nsubsidiaries, and claimants should look\nonly to assets of the Corporation for\npayments. If the Corporation, as\nguarantor of the Guaranteed Notes,\ntransfers all or substantially all of\nits assets to one or more direct or\nindirect majority-owned\n\nsubsidiaries, under the indenture\ngoverning the Guaranteed Notes, the\nsubsidiary or subsidiaries will not be\nrequired to assume the Corporation\u2019s\nobligations under its guarantee of the\nGuaranteed Notes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may\naffect payments to holders of the\nGuaranteed Securities, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 NB Holdings Corporation in this\nsection, Item 1.

Credit risk can also arise\nfrom operational failures that result in\nan erroneous advance, commitment or\ninvestment of funds. We define the\ncredit exposure to a borrower or\ncounterparty as the loss potential\narising from all product classifications\nincluding loans and leases, deposit\noverdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending\ncommitments, which include loan\ncommitments, letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees. Derivative\npositions are recorded at fair value,\nand assets held-for-sale are recorded at\neither fair value or the lower of cost\nor fair value. Certain loans and\nunfunded commitments are accounted for\nunder the fair value option. Credit risk\nfor categories of assets carried at fair\nvalue is not accounted for as part of\nthe allowance for credit losses but as\npart of the fair value adjustments\nrecorded in earnings. For derivative\npositions, our credit risk is measured\nas the net cost in the event the\ncounterparties with contracts in which\nwe are in a gain position fail to\nperform under the terms of those\ncontracts. We use the current fair value\nto represent credit exposure without\ngiving consideration to future mark-to-\nmarket changes. The credit risk amounts\ntake into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting\nagreements and cash collateral. Our\nconsumer and commercial credit extension\nand review procedures encompass funded\nand unfunded credit exposures. For more\ninformation on derivatives and credit\nextension commitments, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives and Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower or counterparty,\nrepayment sources, the nature of\nunderlying collateral and other support\ngiven current events, conditions and\nexpectations. We classify our portfolios\nas either consumer or commercial and\nmonitor credit risk in each as discussed\nbelow.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit\nrisk management practices as well as\ncredit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses\nand enhance customer support in our\nconsumer businesses, we have in place\ncollection programs and loan\nmodification and customer assistance\ninfrastructures. We utilize a number of\nactions to mitigate losses in the\ncommercial businesses including\nincreasing the frequency and intensity\nof portfolio monitoring, hedging\nactivity and our practice of\ntransferring management of deteriorating\ncommercial exposures to independent\nspecial asset officers as credits enter\ncriticized categories.\n\nFor information on our credit risk\nmanagement activities, see the\nfollowing: Consumer Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management on\n                                                                                  \n  57Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \npage 58, Commercial Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management on page 62, Non-U.S.\nPortfolio on page 68, Allowance for\nCredit Losses on page 71, and Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and\nAllowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.

Nonperforming loans\nincreased compared to 2022 driven by the\ncommercial real estate office property\ntype, while commercial reservable\ncriticized exposure increased driven by\nboth office as well as other industries\nthat have been impacted by the current\nenvironment.

Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting\n\ncredit limits, and establishing\noperating processes and metrics to\nquantify and balance risks and returns.\nStatistical models are built using\ndetailed behavioral information from\nexternal sources, such as credit\nbureaus, and/or internal historical\nexperience and are a component of our\nconsumer credit risk management process.\nThese models are used in part to assist\nin making both new and ongoing credit\ndecisions as well as portfolio\nmanagement strategies, including\nauthorizations and line management,\ncollection practices and strategies, and\ndetermination of the allowance for loan\nand lease losses and allocated capital\nfor credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable and home\nprices increased compared to 2022. Net\ncharge-offs increased $1.2 billion to\n$3.1 billion in 2023 primarily due to\nlate-stage delinquent credit card loans\nthat were charged off.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses increased $1.3 billion\nduring 2023 to $8.5 billion.

The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.6 billion, or six percent,\nat December 31, 2023. Residential\nmortgage loans that have entered the\namortization period generally experience\na higher rate of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a\n\nwhole. At December 31, 2023, $80\nmillion, or two percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgages that\nhad entered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $986 million, or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2023, $180 million, or five\npercent, of outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $61 million were\ncontractually current. Loans that have\nyet to enter the amortization period in\nour interest-only residential mortgage\nportfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three years to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n                                                                                  \n  59Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain\nstate concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at\nDecember 31, 2023, $256 million, or 57\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $113 million, or\n25 percent, were 180 days or more past\ndue and had been written down to the\nestimated fair value of the collateral,\nless costs to sell.

The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that had reached the end of their\ndraw period and entered the amortization\nperiod was $4.0 billion at\n\nDecember 31, 2023. The HELOCs that have\nentered the amortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and nonperforming\nstatus when compared to the HELOC\nportfolio as a whole. At December 31,\n2023, $41 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2023, $283 million, or\nseven percent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod.

with an\nassessment of the credit risk profile of\nthe borrower or counterparty based on an\nanalysis of its financial position. As\npart of the overall credit risk\nassessment, our commercial credit\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and\nare subject to approval based on defined\ncredit approval standards. Subsequent to\nloan origination, risk ratings are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis, and if\nnecessary, adjusted to reflect changes\nin the financial condition, cash flow,\nrisk profile or outlook of a borrower or\ncounterparty. In making credit\ndecisions, we consider risk rating,\ncollateral, country, industry and\nsingle-name concentration limits while\nalso balancing these considerations with\nthe total borrower or counterparty\nrelationship. We use a variety of tools\nto continuously monitor the ability of a\nborrower or counterparty to perform\nunder its obligations. We use risk\nrating aggregations to measure and\nevaluate concentrations within\nportfolios. In addition, risk ratings\nare a factor in determining the level of\nallocated capital and the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation\ninitiatives, we attempt to work with\nclients experiencing financial\ndifficulty to modify their loans to\nterms that better align with their\ncurrent ability to pay. For more\ninformation on our accounting policies\nregarding delinquencies, nonperforming\nstatus and net charge-offs for the\ncommercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nManagement of Commercial Credit Risk\nConcentrations\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\n\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 32, 34 and 37 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For more information\non our industry concentrations, see\nTable 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations on page 66.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate\nloans and loan commitments, including\nissued but unfunded letters of credit\nwhich are considered utilized for credit\nrisk management purposes, that exceed\nour single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair\nvalue option. Lending commitments, both\nfunded and unfunded, are actively\nmanaged and monitored, and as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith our credit view and market\nperspectives determining the size and\ntiming of the hedging activity. In\naddition, we purchase credit protection\nto cover the funded portion as well as\nthe unfunded portion of certain other\ncredit exposures. To lessen the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection\nlevels, credit exposure may be added\nwithin an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. These credit derivatives do\nnot meet the requirements for treatment\nas accounting hedges. They are carried\nat fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America62                                                               \n                                                                                  \nother countries.

During 2023,\ncommercial credit quality deteriorated\nas nonperforming commercial loans and\nreservable criticized utilized exposure\nincreased primarily driven by the\ncommercial real estate office property\ntype; however, the commercial net\ncharge-off ratio of 0.12 percent during\n2023 remained low.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2022; however, we are\nclosely monitoring emerging trends and\nborrower performance in the increased\nrate environment and challenging capital\nmarkets. Recent demand for office space\nhas been stagnant, and future demand for\noffice space continues to be uncertain\nas\n\ncompanies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $623 million\nduring 2023 to $4.8 billion, primarily\ndriven by improved macroeconomic\nconditions. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 71.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure decreased $8.6 billion during\n2023 to $696.3 billion primarily driven\nby lower derivative assets. The\nutilization rate for loans and leases,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\nfinancial guarantees, and commercial\nletters of credit, in the aggregate, was\n55 percent and 56 percent at December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTable 28 presents commercial credit\nexposure by type for utilized, unfunded\nand total binding committed credit\nexposure.

We use\na number of proactive risk mitigation\ninitiatives to reduce adversely rated\nexposure in the commercial real estate\nportfolio, including transfers of\ndeteriorating exposures for management\nby independent special asset officers\nand the pursuit of loan restructurings\nor asset sales to achieve the best\nresults for our customers and the\nCorporation.\n\nTable 32 presents outstanding commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic region,\nbased on the geographic location of the\ncollateral, and by property type.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 32                 Outstanding Commercial                                 \n  (Dollars in millions)    Real                         December 31               \n  By Geographic Region     Estate Loans                        2023         2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Northeast                                          $       15,920    $  15,601  \n  California                                                 14,551       13,360  \n  Southwest                                                   9,318        8,723  \n  Southeast                                                   8,368        7,713  \n  Florida                                                     4,986        5,374  \n  Illinois                                                    3,361        3,327  \n  Midwest                                                     3,149        3,419  \n  Midsouth                                                    2,785        2,716  \n  Northwest                                                   2,095        1,959  \n  Non-U.S.                                                    6,052        5,518  \n  Other                                                       2,293        2,056  \n  Total outstanding                                                               \n  commercial real                                    $       72,878    $  69,766  \n  estate                                                                          \n  loans                                                                           \n  By Property Type                                                                \n  Non-residential                                                                 \n  Office                                             $       17,976    $  18,230  \n  Industrial /                                               14,746       13,775  \n  Warehouse                                                                       \n  Multi-family rental                                        10,606       10,412  \n  Shopping centers /                                          5,756        5,830  \n  Retail                                                                          \n  Hotel / Motels                                              5,665        5,696  \n  Multi-use                                                   2,681        2,403  \n  Other                                                      14,201       12,241  \n  Total non-residential                                      71,631       68,587  \n  Residential                                                 1,247        1,179  \n  Total outstanding                                                               \n  commercial real                                    $       72,878    $  69,766  \n  estate                                                                          \n  loans                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  65Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  U.S. Small Business Commercial                                                  \n                                                                                  \nThe U.S. small business commercial loan\nportfolio is comprised of small business\ncard loans and small business loans\nprimarily managed in Consumer Banking,\nand included $329 million and $1.0\nbillion of Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) loans outstanding at December 31,\n2023 and 2022.

For information on net\nnotional credit protection purchased to\nhedge funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option,\nas well as certain other credit\nexposures, see Commercial Portfolio\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Risk\nMitigation.\n\nCommercial credit exposure is\ndiversified across a broad range of\nindustries. Total commercial committed\nexposure increased $13.9 billion during\n2023 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in\ncommercial committed exposure was\nconcentrated in Capital goods, Finance\ncompanies and Asset managers and funds.\n\nIndustry limits are used internally to\nmanage industry concentrations and are\nbased on committed exposure that is\ndetermined on an industry-by-industry\nbasis. A risk management framework is in\nplace to set and approve industry limits\nas well as to provide ongoing\nmonitoring.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $169.3 billion, increased\n$4.2 billion, primarily driven by\nexposure to the Capital markets industry\ngroup during 2023.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry\nconcentration with committed exposure of\n$100.3 billion remained relatively\nunchanged during 2023. For more\ninformation on the commercial real\nestate and related portfolios, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Commercial Real Estate on\npage 65.\n\nCapital goods, our third largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $97.0 billion, increased\n$9.7 billion, or 11 percent, during\n2023. The increase in committed exposure\noccurred primarily as a result of\nincreases in Trading companies and\ndistributors as well as Machinery,\npartially offset by a decrease in\nIndustrial conglomerates.\n\nThe impact of various macroeconomic\nchallenges, including geopolitical\ntensions, inflationary pressures and\nelevated interest rates, may lead to\nuncertainty in the U.S. and global\neconomies, and may adversely impact a\nnumber of industries. We continue to\nmonitor all industries, particularly\nhigher risk industries that are\nexperiencing or could experience a more\nsignificant impact to their financial\ncondition.\n

To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, net notional credit default\nprotection purchased in our credit\nderivatives portfolio to hedge our\nfunded and unfunded exposures for which\nwe elected the fair value option, as\nwell as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $10.9 billion and $9.0 billion. We\nrecorded net losses of $185 million in\n2023 compared to net losses of $37\nmillion in 2022. The gains and losses on\nthese instruments were largely offset by\ngains and losses on the related\nexposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR)\nresults for these exposures are included\nin the fair value option portfolio\ninformation in Table 41.

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and\nany names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default\nprotection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit\nexposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients\nand establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value\nchanges. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market\nwith large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to\na lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are\nexecuted in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject\nto credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the\nterms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk,\nwe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative\nassets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit\nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events\nsuch as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of\ncredit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral\nrequired by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional\nprotective measures such as early termination of all\n\ntrades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk\nvaluation adjustments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements . Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are\nsubject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from\nunfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in\nplace to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to\nthe direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. Table 37\npresents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2023. These\nexposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31,\n2023 and 2022. Net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $13.1 billion\nin 2023 primarily driven by decreases in Germany and Japan. Non-U.S. exposure is\npresented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-\nsovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled\nin countries other than the U.S. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans,\nleases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and\ndue from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally\nbinding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty\nexposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk\nassociated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions.\nSecurities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities\nexposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to,\nbut not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges\nand credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.\n

million from December 31,\n2022 to $14.6 billion at December 31,\n2023, which included a $1.3 billion\nreserve increase related to the consumer\nportfolio and a $942 million reserve\ndecrease related to the commercial\nportfolio. The increase in the allowance\nreflected a reserve build in our\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\ncredit card loan growth and asset\nquality, partially offset by a reserve\nrelease in our commercial portfolio\nprimarily driven by improved\nmacroeconomic conditions applicable to\nthe\n\ncommercial portfolio. The allowance also\nincludes the impact of the accounting\nchange to remove the recognition and\nmeasurement guidance on troubled debt\nrestructurings, which reduced the\nallowance for credit losses by $243\nmillion on January 1, 2023.

$3.8\nbillion compared to $2.2 billion in 2022\nprimarily due to late-stage delinquent\ncredit card loans that were charged off.\nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $1.9 billion to $4.4 billion\nduring 2023 compared to 2022. The\nprovision for credit losses in 2023 was\ndriven by our consumer portfolio\nprimarily due to credit card loan growth\nand asset quality, partially offset by\nimproved macroeconomic conditions that\nprimarily benefited our commercial\nportfolio. The provision for credit\nlosses for the consumer portfolio,\nincluding unfunded lending commitments,\nincreased $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion\nduring 2023 compared to 2022. The\nprovision for credit losses for the\ncommercial portfolio, including unfunded\nlending\n\ncommitments, decreased $628 million to a\n$133 million benefit for 2023 compared\nto 2022. The decline was due primarily\nto an improved macroeconomic outlook.\n\nTable 40 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\n2023 and 2022.

                                     \nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results. For more information, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 77.\n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit\nproducts are non-trading positions and\nare generally reported at amortized cost\nfor assets or the amount owed for\nliabilities (historical cost). However,\nthese positions are still subject to\nchanges in economic value based on\nvarying market conditions, with one of\nthe primary risks being changes in the\nlevels of interest rates. The risk of\nadverse changes in the economic value of\nour non-trading positions arising from\nchanges in interest rates is managed\nthrough our ALM activities. We have\nelected to account for certain assets\nand liabilities under the fair value\noption.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at\nfair value with changes reflected in\nincome. Trading positions are subject to\nvarious changes in market-based risk\nfactors. The majority of this risk is\ngenerated by our activities in the\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, credit,\nequity and commodities markets. In\naddition, the values of assets and\nliabilities could change due to market\nliquidity, correlations across markets\nand expectations of market volatility.\nWe seek to manage these risk exposures\nby using a variety of techniques that\nencompass a broad range of financial\ninstruments. The key risk management\ntechniques are discussed in more detail\nin the Trading Risk Management section.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior\nmanagement with a clear and\ncomprehensive understanding of the\ntrading risks to which we are exposed.\nThese responsibilities include ownership\nof market risk policy, developing and\nmaintaining quantitative risk models,\ncalculating aggregated risk measures,\nestablishing and monitoring position\nlimits consistent with risk appetite,\nconducting daily reviews and analysis of\ntrading inventory, approving material\nrisk exposures and fulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. Market risks that impact\nbusinesses outside of Global Markets are\nmonitored and governed by their\nrespective governance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse\nconsequences from decisions based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and\nreports. Given that models are used\nacross the Corporation, model risk\nimpacts all risk types including credit,\nmarket and operational risks. The\nEnterprise Model Risk Policy defines\nmodel risk standards, consistent with\nour Risk Framework and risk appetite,\nprevailing regulatory guidance and\nindustry best practice. All models,\nincluding risk management, valuation and\nregulatory capital models, must meet\ncertain validation criteria, including\neffective challenge of the conceptual\nsoundness of the model, independent\nmodel testing and ongoing monitoring\nthrough outcomes analysis and\nbenchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk\nCommittee, a subcommittee of the MRC,\noversees that model standards are\nconsistent with model risk requirements\nand monitors the effective challenge in\nthe model validation process across the\nCorporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Interest Rate Risk                                                              \n                                                                                  \nInterest rate risk represents exposures\nto instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest\nrates. These instruments include, but\nare not limited to, loans, debt\n\nsecurities, certain trading-related\nassets and liabilities, deposits,\nborrowings and derivatives. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate these risks\ninclude derivatives such as options,\nfutures, forwards and swaps.\n                                                                                  \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                                                           \n                                                                                  \nForeign exchange risk represents\nexposures to changes in the values of\ncurrent holdings and future cash flows\ndenominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar. The types of instruments\nexposed to this risk include investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign\ncurrency-denominated loans and\nsecurities, future cash flows in foreign\ncurrencies arising from foreign exchange\ntransactions, foreign currency-\ndenominated debt and various foreign\nexchange derivatives whose values\nfluctuate with changes in the level or\nvolatility of currency exchange rates or\nnon-U.S. interest rates. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk\ninclude foreign exchange options,\ncurrency swaps, futures, forwards, and\nforeign currency-denominated debt and\ndeposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Mortgage Risk                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nMortgage risk represents exposures to\nchanges in the values of mortgage-\nrelated instruments. The values of these\ninstruments are sensitive to prepayment\nrates, mortgage rates, agency debt\nratings, default, market liquidity,\ngovernment participation and interest\nrate volatility. Our exposure to these\ninstruments takes several forms. For\nexample, we trade and engage in market-\nmaking activities in a variety of\nmortgage securities including whole\nloans, pass-through certificates,\ncommercial mortgages and collateralized\nmortgage obligations including\ncollateralized debt obligations using\nmortgages as underlying collateral. In\naddition, we originate a variety of MBS,\nwhich involves the accumulation of\nmortgage-related loans in anticipation\nof eventual securitization, and we may\nhold positions in mortgage securities\nand residential mortgage loans as part\nof the ALM portfolio. We also record\nMSRs as part of our mortgage origination\nactivities. Hedging instruments used to\nmitigate this risk include derivatives\nsuch as options, swaps, futures and\nforwards as well as securities including\nMBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For\nmore information, see Mortgage Banking\nRisk Management on page 79.\n                                                                                  \n  Equity Market Risk                                                              \n                                                                                  \nEquity market risk represents exposures\nto securities that represent an\nownership interest in a corporation in\nthe form of domestic and foreign common\nstock or other equity-linked\ninstruments.

Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk\ninclude bonds, CDS and other credit\nfixed-income instruments.\n                                                                                  \n   Market Liquidity Risk                                                          \n                                                                                  \nMarket liquidity risk represents the\nrisk that the level of expected market\nactivity changes dramatically and, in\ncertain cases, may even cease. This\nexposes us to the risk that we will not\nbe able to transact business and execute\ntrades in an orderly manner which may\nimpact our results. This impact could be\nfurther exacerbated if expected hedging\nor pricing correlations are compromised\nby disproportionate demand or lack of\ndemand for certain instruments. We\nutilize various risk mitigating\ntechniques as discussed in more detail\nin Trading Risk Management.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. Various\ntechniques and procedures are utilized\nto enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks.\nQuantitative measures of market risk are\nevaluated on a daily basis from a single\nposition to the portfolio of the\nCorporation. These measures include\nsensitivities of positions to various\nmarket risk factors, such as the\npotential impact on revenue from a one\nbasis point change in interest rates,\nand statistical measures utilizing both\nactual and hypothetical market moves,\nsuch as VaR and stress testing. Periods\nof extreme market stress influence the\nreliability of these techniques to\nvarying degrees. Qualitative evaluations\nof market risk utilize the suite of\nquantitative risk measures while\nunderstanding each of their respective\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers\nindependently evaluate the risk of the\nportfolios under the current market\nenvironment and potential future\nenvironments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to\nmeasure market risk as it allows the\naggregation of market risk factors,\nincluding the effects of portfolio\ndiversification. A VaR model simulates\nthe value of a portfolio under a range\nof scenarios in order to generate a\ndistribution of potential gains and\nlosses. VaR represents the loss a\nportfolio is not expected to exceed more\nthan a certain number of times per\nperiod, based on a specified holding\nperiod, confidence level and window of\nhistorical data. We use one VaR model\nconsistently across the trading\nportfolios and it uses a historical\nsimulation approach based on a three-\nyear window of historical data. Our\nprimary VaR statistic is equivalent to a\n99 percent confidence level, which means\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding\nperiod, there should not be losses in\nexcess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100\ntrading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are\nsignificant and numerous assumptions\nthat will differ from company to\ncompany. The accuracy of a VaR model\ndepends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk\nfactors in the portfolio. A VaR model\nmay require additional modeling\nassumptions for new products that do not\nhave the necessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid positions for\nwhich accurate daily prices are not\nconsistently available. For positions\nwith insufficient historical data for\nthe VaR calculation, the process for\nestablishing an appropriate proxy is\nbased on fundamental and\n\nstatistical analysis of the new product\nor less liquid position. This analysis\nidentifies reasonable alternatives that\nreplicate both the expected volatility\nand correlation to other market risk\nfactors that the missing data would be\nexpected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized\nrevenue volatility as changes in market\nconditions or in the composition of the\nportfolio can have a material impact on\nthe results. In particular, the\nhistorical data used for the VaR\ncalculation might indicate higher or\nlower levels of portfolio\ndiversification than will be\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model\nto reflect current market conditions, we\nupdate the historical data underlying\nour VaR model on a weekly basis, or more\nfrequently during periods of market\nstress, and regularly review the\nassumptions underlying the model. A\nminor portion of risks related to our\ntrading positions is not included in\nVaR. These risks are reviewed as part of\nour ICAAP. For more information\nregarding ICAAP, see Capital Management\non page 47.\n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates and\nenhances our VaR model so that it\nreflects the material risks in our\ntrading portfolio. Changes to the VaR\nmodel are reviewed and approved prior to\nimplementation and any material changes\nare reported to management through the\nappropriate management committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk\nmeasures, including VaR, are\nindependently set by Global Markets Risk\nManagement and reviewed on a regular\nbasis so that trading limits remain\nrelevant and within our overall risk\nappetite for market risks. Trading\nlimits are reviewed in the context of\nmarket liquidity, volatility and\nstrategic business priorities. Trading\nlimits are set at both a granular level\nto allow for extensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to\naccount for correlations among risk\nfactors. All trading limits are approved\nat least annually. Approved trading\nlimits are stored and tracked in a\ncentralized limits management system.\nTrading limit excesses are communicated\nto management for review. Certain\nquantitative market risk measures and\ncorresponding limits have been\nidentified as critical in the\nCorporation\u2019s Risk Appetite Statement.\nThese risk appetite limits are reported\non a daily basis and are approved at\nleast annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global\nMarkets senior leadership communicates\ndaily to discuss losses, key risk\npositions and any limit excesses. As a\nresult of this process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 41 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. Covered\npositions are defined by regulatory\nstandards as trading assets and\nliabilities, both on- and off-balance\nsheet, that meet a defined set of\nspecifications. These specifications\nidentify the most liquid trading\npositions which are intended to be held\nfor a short-term horizon and where we\nare able to hedge the material risk\nelements in a two-way market. Positions\nin less liquid markets, or where there\nare restrictions on the ability to trade\nthe positions, typically do not qualify\nas covered positions. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, except for\nstructural foreign currency positions\nthat are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval.\n\nIn addition, Table 41 presents the VaR\nfor the fair value option portfolio,\nwhich includes substantially all of the\nfunded and unfunded exposures for which\nwe elect the fair value option, and\ntheir corresponding hedges. Market risk\nVaR for trading activities, as presented\nin Table 41, differs from VaR used for\nregulatory capital calculations due to\nthe holding period used.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America74                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe holding period for VaR used for\nregulatory capital calculations is 10\ndays, while for the market risk VaR\npresented below, it is one day.

methodology is\nevaluated by backtesting, which compares\nthe daily VaR results, utilizing a one-\nday holding period, against a comparable\nsubset of trading revenue. A backtesting\nexcess occurs when a trading loss\nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding\nday. These excesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and market\nmoves that produced the trading loss\nwith a goal to help confirm that the VaR\nmethodology accurately represents those\nlosses. We expect the frequency of\ntrading losses in excess of VaR to be in\nline with the confidence level of the\nVaR statistic being tested. For example,\nwith a 99 percent confidence level, we\nexpect one trading loss in excess of VaR\nevery 100 days or between two to three\ntrading losses in excess of VaR over the\ncourse of a year. The number of\nbacktesting excesses observed can differ\nfrom the statistically expected number\nof excesses if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially\ndifferent than the level of market\nvolatility that existed during the three\nyears of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting\nis defined by regulatory agencies in\norder to most closely align with the VaR\ncomponent of the regulatory capital\ncalculation. This revenue differs from\ntotal trading-related revenue in that it\nexcludes revenue from trading activities\nthat either do not generate market risk\nor the market risk cannot be included in\nVaR. Some examples of the types of\nrevenue excluded for backtesting are\nfees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income and intra-day trading\nrevenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR\nresults used for regulatory capital\ncalculations as well as the VaR results\nfor key legal entities, regions and risk\nfactors. These results are\n\nreported to senior market risk\nmanagement. Senior management regularly\nreviews and evaluates the results of\nthese tests.\n\nDuring 2023, there were no days where\nthis subset of trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our total covered\nportfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day\nholding period.\n                                                                                  \n  Total Trading-related Revenue                                                   \n                                                                                  \nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding\nbrokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding\nvaluation adjustment gains (losses),\nrepresents the total amount earned from\ntrading positions, including market-\nbased net interest income, which are\ntaken in a diverse range of financial\ninstruments and markets. For more\ninformation on fair value, see Note 20 \u2013\nFair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile\nand is largely driven by general market\nconditions and customer demand. Also,\ntrading-related revenue is dependent on\nthe volume and type of transactions, the\nlevel of risk assumed, and the\nvolatility of price and rate movements\nat any given time within the ever-\nchanging market environment. Significant\ndaily revenue by business is monitored\nand the primary drivers of these are\nreviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a graphic\ndepiction of trading volatility and\nillustrates the daily level of trading-\nrelated revenue for 2023 and 2022.\nDuring 2023, positive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for 100 percent of\nthe trading days, of which 93 percent\nwere daily trading gains of over $25\nmillion. This compares to 2022 where\npositive trading-related revenue was\nrecorded for 99 percent of the trading\ndays, of which 90 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25 million, and\nthe largest loss was $9 million.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America76                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing Because\nthe very nature of a VaR model suggests\nresults can exceed our estimates and it\nis dependent on a limited historical\nwindow, we also stress test our\nportfolio using scenario analysis. This\nanalysis estimates the change in the\nvalue of our trading portfolio that may\nresult from abnormal market movements. A\nset of scenarios, categorized as either\nhistorical or hypothetical, are computed\ndaily for the overall trading portfolio\nand individual businesses. These\nscenarios include shocks to underlying\nmarket risk factors that may be well\nbeyond the shocks found in the\nhistorical data used to calculate VaR.\nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact\nof the market moves that occurred during\na period of extended historical market\nstress. Generally, a multi-week period\nrepresenting the most severe point\nduring a crisis is selected for each\nhistorical scenario. Hypothetical\nscenarios provide estimated portfolio\nimpacts from potential future market\nstress events. Scenarios are reviewed\nand updated in response to changing\npositions and new economic or political\ninformation. In addition, new or ad hoc\nscenarios are developed to address\nspecific potential market events or\nparticular vulnerabilities in the\nportfolio. The stress tests are reviewed\non a regular basis and the results are\npresented to senior management. Stress\ntesting for the trading portfolio is\nintegrated with enterprise-wide stress\ntesting and incorporated into the limits\nframework. The macroeconomic scenarios\nused for enterprise-wide stress testing\npurposes differ from the typical trading\nportfolio scenarios in that they have a\nlonger time horizon and the results are\nforecasted over multiple periods for use\nin consolidated capital and liquidity\nplanning.

Interest rate risk\nrepresents the most significant market\nrisk exposure to our banking book\nbalance sheet. Interest rate risk is\nmeasured as the potential change in net\ninterest income caused by movements in\nmarket interest rates. Client-facing\n\nactivities, primarily lending and\ndeposit-taking, create interest rate\nsensitive positions on our balance\nsheet. We prepare forward-looking\nforecasts of net interest income. The\nbaseline forecast takes into\nconsideration expected future business\ngrowth, ALM positioning and the future\ndirection of interest rate movements as\nimplied by market-based forward curves.\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact\nthat alternative interest rate scenarios\nhave on the baseline forecast in order\nto assess interest rate sensitivity\nunder varied conditions. The net\ninterest income forecast is frequently\nupdated for changing assumptions and\ndiffering outlooks based on economic\ntrends, market conditions and business\nstrategies. Thus, we continually monitor\nour banking book balance sheet position\nin order to maintain an acceptable level\nof exposure to interest rate changes.\nThe interest rate scenarios that we\nanalyze incorporate balance sheet\nassumptions such as loan and deposit\ngrowth and pricing, changes in funding\nmix, product repricing, maturity\ncharacteristics and investment\nsecurities premium amortization. Our\noverall goal is to manage interest rate\nrisk so that movements in interest rates\ndo not significantly adversely affect\nearnings and capital.

The interest rate scenarios\nalso assume U.S. dollar interest rates\nare floored at zero. During 2023, the\noverall decrease in asset sensitivity of\nour balance sheet to higher and lower\nrate scenarios was primarily due to\nchanges in deposit product mix and ALM\nportfolio activity. We continue to be\nasset sensitive to a parallel upward\nmove in interest rates with the majority\nof that impact coming from the short end\nof the yield curve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates negatively impact the\nfair value of our debt securities\nclassified as available for sale and\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As part of our ALM activities,\nwe use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our\ndeposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size\nor mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate\nscenarios, the increase in net interest income would be impacted by any customer\nactivity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits\nwith higher yielding deposits or market-based funding, as our benefit in those\nscenarios would be reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate scenarios, any customer\nactivity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce our\nexposure in those scenarios. For interest rate scenarios larger than 100 bps\nshifts, it is expected that the interest rate sensitivity will illustrate non-\nlinear behaviors as there are numerous estimates and\n\nassumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated,\nthat could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to\nsignificantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps,\ncustomer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental\nincrease to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing will have non-linear\nimpacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios,\nand particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate,\nleading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the\nimpact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can\nprovide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in\nchanging environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship\nof the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts We use interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest\nrate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage\nboth the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and\nliabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are\ngenerally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures\ncontracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. The derivatives used in\nour ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting\nhedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the\nsensitivities presented in Table 44. The Corporation also uses foreign currency\nderivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not\nsignificant. Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash\nflows of the Corporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial\ninstruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk\nexposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as\nthese features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange\nderivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more\ninformation on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can\nbe substantial in the mortgage business.\nChanges in interest rates and other\nmarket factors impact the volume of\nmortgage originations. Changes in\ninterest rates also impact the value of\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)\nand the related residential first\nmortgage loans held-for-sale between the\ndate of the IRLC and the date the loans\nare sold to the secondary market. An\nincrease in mortgage interest rates\ntypically leads to a decrease in the\nvalue of these instruments. Conversely,\nwhen there is an increase in interest\nrates, the value of the MSRs will\nincrease driven by lower prepayment\nexpectations. Because the interest rate\nrisks of these hedged items offset, we\ncombine them into one overall hedged\nitem with one combined economic hedge\nportfolio consisting of derivative\ncontracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2023, 2022, and 2021 we recorded\ngains of $127 million, $78 million and\n$39 million.

The Corporation\nfaces a number of key operational risks\nincluding third-party risk, model risk,\nconduct risk, technology risk,\ninformation security risk and data risk.\nOperational risk can result in financial\nlosses and reputational impacts and is a\ncomponent in the calculation of total\nRWA used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculation. For more information on\nBasel 3 calculations, see Capital\nManagement on page 47.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and\nforemost responsible for managing all\naspects of their businesses, including\ntheir compliance and operational risk.\nFLUs and control functions are required\nto understand their business processes\nand related risks and controls,\nincluding third-party dependencies and\nthe related regulatory requirements, and\nmonitor and report on the effectiveness\nof the control environment. In order to\nactively monitor and assess the\nperformance of their processes and\ncontrols, they must conduct\ncomprehensive quality assurance\nactivities and identify issues and risks\nto remediate control gaps and\nweaknesses. FLUs and control functions\nmust also adhere to compliance and\noperational risk appetite limits to meet\nstrategic, capital and\n\nfinancial planning objectives. Finally,\nFLUs and control functions are\nresponsible for the proactive\nidentification, management and\nescalation of compliance and operational\nrisks across the Corporation.\nCollectively, these efforts are\nimportant to strengthen their compliance\nand operational resiliency, which is the\nability to deliver critical operations\nthrough disruption.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk\nteams independently assess compliance\nand operational risk, monitor business\nactivities and processes and evaluate\nFLUs and control functions for adherence\nto applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, including identifying\nissues and risks, and reporting on the\nstate of the control environment.\nCorporate Audit provides an independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key compliance and\noperational risk processes and controls\nacross the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance \u2013\nEnterprise Policy and Operational Risk\nManagement \u2013 Enterprise Policy set the\nrequirements for reporting compliance\nand operational risk information to\nexecutive management as well as the\nBoard or appropriate Board-level\ncommittees and reflect Global Compliance\nand Operational Risk\u2019s responsibilities\nfor conducting independent oversight of\nthe Corporation\u2019s compliance and\noperational risk management activities.\nThe Board provides oversight of\ncompliance risk through its Audit\nCommittee and the ERC, and operational\nrisk through its ERC.\n                                                                                  \n  Cybersecurity                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management and Strategy                                                   \n                                                                                  \nCybersecurity is a key operational risk\nfacing the Corporation. We, our\nemployees, customers, regulators and\nthird parties are ongoing targets of an\nincreasing number of cybersecurity\nthreats and cyberattacks and,\naccordingly, the Corporation devotes\nconsiderable resources to the\nestablishment and maintenance of\nprocesses for assessing, identifying and\nmanaging cybersecurity risk through its\nglobal workforce and 24/7 cyber\noperations centers around the world. The\nCorporation takes a cross-functional\napproach to addressing cybersecurity\nrisk, with our Global Technology, Global\nRisk Management, Legal and Corporate\nAudit functions playing key roles. In\naddition, the Corporation\u2019s processes\nrelated to cybersecurity risk are an\nelement of and integrated with the\nCorporation\u2019s comprehensive risk\nprogram, including our risk framework.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s Cybersecurity risk, see\nItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Business\nOperations beginning on page 14. For\nmore information on our approach to risk\nmanagement, including our risk\nmanagement governance framework, see\nManaging Risk on page 44.\n\nAs part of the Corporation\u2019s overall\nrisk management program, the\nCorporation\u2019s Global Information\nSecurity (GIS) Program is supported by\nthree lines of defense. As the first\nline of defense, the GIS team is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the GIS Program, which\nincludes defining policies and\nprocedures designed to safeguard the\nCorporation\u2019s information systems and\nthe information those systems collect,\nprocess, maintain, use, share,\ndisseminate and dispose of. As the\nsecond line of defense, Global\nCompliance and Operational Risk\nindependently assesses, monitors and\ntests cybersecurity risk across the\nCorporation, as well as the\neffectiveness of the GIS Program. As the\nthird line of defense, Corporate Audit\nconducts additional independent review\nand validation of the first-line and\nsecond-line processes and functions.\n\nThe Corporation seeks to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and associated legal,\nfinancial, reputational, operational\nand/or regulatory risks by employing a\nmulti-faceted GIS Program,\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nthrough various policies, procedures and\nplaybooks, that are focused on\ngoverning, preparing for, identifying,\npreventing, detecting, mitigating,\nresponding to and recovering from\ncybersecurity threats and cybersecurity\nincidents suffered by the Corporation\nand its third-party service providers,\nas well as effectively operating the\nCorporation\u2019s processes. Our business\ncontinuity policy, standards and\nprocedures are designed to maintain the\navailability of business functions and\nenable impacted units within the\nCorporation and its third-party service\nproviders to achieve strategic\nobjectives in the event of a\ncybersecurity incident. In accordance\nwith the Corporation\u2019s cyber incident\nresponse framework, GIS, including its\nincident response team, tracks,\ndocuments, responds to and analyzes\ncybersecurity threats and cybersecurity\nincidents, including those experienced\nby the Corporation\u2019s third-party service\nproviders that may impact the\nCorporation. Additionally, the\nCorporation has a process for assembling\nmulti-stakeholder executive response\nteams to monitor and coordinate cross-\nfunctional responses to certain\ncybersecurity incidents.\n\nAs part of the GIS Program, the\nCorporation leverages both internal and\nexternal assessments and partnerships\nwith industry leaders. The Corporation\nengages third-party assessors,\nconsultants, auditors and other third-\nparty professionals to evaluate and test\nits cybersecurity program and provide\nguidance on operating and improving the\nGIS Program, including the design and\noperational effectiveness of the\nsecurity and resiliency of our\ninformation systems.\n\nThe Corporation focuses on and has\nprocesses to oversee cybersecurity risk\nassociated with its third-party service\nproviders. As part of its cybersecurity\nrisk management processes, the\nCorporation maintains an enterprise-wide\nprogram that defines standards for the\nplanning, sourcing, management, and\noversight of third-party relationships\nand third-party access to its\ninformation system, facilities, and/or\nconfidential or proprietary data. The\nCorporation has established security\nrequirements applicable to third-party\nservice providers, and where permitted\nby contract, cybersecurity diligence is\nconducted to assess the alignment of\nthird-party service providers\u2019\ncybersecurity programs with the\nCorporation\u2019s cybersecurity\nrequirements.\n\nWhile we and our third parties have\nexperienced cybersecurity incidents, as\nwell as adverse impacts from such\nincidents, we have not experienced\nmaterial losses or other material\nconsequences relating to cybersecurity\nincidents experienced by us or our third\nparties. However, we expect to continue\nto experience cybersecurity incidents\nresulting in adverse impacts with\nincreased frequency and severity due to\nthe evolving threat environment, and\nthere can be no assurance that future\ncybersecurity incidents, including\nincidents experienced by our third\nparties, will not have a material\nadverse impact on the Corporation,\nincluding its business strategy, results\nof operations and/or financial\ncondition.\n                                                                                  \n  Governance                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThrough established governance\nstructures, the Corporation has\npolicies, processes and practices to\nhelp facilitate oversight of\ncybersecurity risk. In accordance with\nthese policies, processes and practices,\nthe Corporation\u2019s three lines of\ndefense, and management, strive to\nprepare for, identify, prevent, detect,\nmitigate, respond to and recover from\ncybersecurity threats and incidents,\nmonitor performance, and escalate to\nexecutive management, the committees of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Board and/or to the\nBoard, as appropriate. Additionally, GIS\nreports cybersecurity incidents that\nmeet certain criteria to the Legal\nDepartment for further escalation and\nevaluation for materiality\n\nand potential disclosure, which includes\nthe consideration of relevant\nquantitative and qualitative factors.\n\nThe Board is actively engaged in the\noversight of the GIS Program and devotes\nconsiderable time and attention to the\noversight and mitigation of\ncybersecurity risk. The Board, which\nincludes members with technology and\ncybersecurity experience, oversees\nmanagement\u2019s approach to staffing,\npolicies, processes and practices to\naddress cybersecurity risk. The Board\nand its ERC, which is responsible for\nreviewing cybersecurity risk, each\nreceive regular presentations, memoranda\nand reports throughout the year from our\nChief Technology and Information Officer\n(CTIO) and our Chief Information\nSecurity Officer (CISO) on internal and\nexternal cybersecurity developments,\nthreats and risks. On a quarterly basis,\nGIS sends the Board a memorandum\nhighlighting relevant cybersecurity\ndevelopments and a document detailing\nthe performance metrics for the GIS\nProgram.\n\nThe Board receives prompt and timely\ninformation from management on\ncybersecurity incidents, including\ncybersecurity incidents experienced by\nthe Corporation\u2019s third-party service\nproviders, that may pose significant\nrisk to the Corporation, and continues\nto receive regular reports on any such\nincidents until their conclusion.\nAdditionally, the Board receives\nquarterly reports on the performance of\nthe Corporation\u2019s cybersecurity risk\nappetite metrics, including metrics on\nvulnerabilities and third-party\ncybersecurity risks and incidents and is\nnotified promptly if a Board-level\ncybersecurity risk limit is breached.\n\nOur ERC also annually reviews and\napproves our GIS Program and our\nInformation Security Policy, which\nestablish administrative, technical, and\nphysical safeguards designed to protect\nthe security, confidentiality and\nintegrity of customer records and\ninformation in accordance with the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the\ninteragency guidelines issued\nthereunder, and applicable laws\nglobally.\n\nUnder the Board\u2019s oversight, management\nworks closely with key stakeholders,\nincluding regulators, government\nagencies, law enforcement, peer\ninstitutions and industry groups, and\ndevelops and invests in talent and\ninnovative technology in order to better\nmanage cybersecurity risk.\n\nOur most senior cybersecurity employees\nare the CTIO and CISO, who are primarily\nresponsible for managing and assessing\ncybersecurity risk. The CISO oversees a\nteam of more than 3,000 information\nsecurity professionals spanning the\nglobe. The CISO and the GIS senior\nleadership team of ten individuals have\ndeep cybersecurity expertise, with over\n100 years of collective experience\nworking in the cybersecurity field, both\nat the Corporation and other companies\nin various industries. Additionally,\ncertain members of the GIS leadership\nteam hold leadership roles in sector-\nspecific information and infrastructure\nsecurity organizations, including the\nFinancial Services Information Sharing\nand Analysis Center and the Financial\nServices Sector Coordinating Council.\nEmployees across the Corporation also\nplay a role in protecting the\nCorporation from cybersecurity threats\nand receive periodic training and\neducation on cybersecurity-related\ntopics.\n                                                                                  \n   Reputational Risk Management                                                   \n                                                                                  \nReputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations. Reputational risk may result\nfrom many of the Corporation\u2019s\nactivities, including those related to\nthe management of strategic,\noperational, compliance, liquidity,\nmarket (price and interest rate) and\ncredit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational\nrisk through established policies and\ncontrols embedded throughout its\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America80                                                               \n                                                                                  \nbusiness and risk management processes.\nWe proactively monitor and identify\npotential reputational risk events and\nhave processes established to mitigate\nreputational risks in a timely manner.\nIf reputational risk events occur, we\nfocus on remediating the underlying\nissue and taking action to minimize\ndamage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Corporation has processes and\nprocedures in place to respond to events\nthat give rise to reputational risk,\nincluding educating individuals and\norganizations that influence public\nopinion, and implementing communication\nstrategies to mitigate the risk. The\nCorporation\u2019s organization and\ngovernance structure provides oversight\nof reputational risks. Reputational risk\nreporting is provided regularly and\ndirectly to senior management and the\nERC, which provides primary oversight of\nreputational risk. In addition, each FLU\nhas a committee, which includes\nrepresentatives from Legal and Risk,\nthat is responsible for the oversight of\nreputational risk, including approval\nfor business activities that present\nelevated levels of reputational risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Climate Risk                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate risk is the risk that climate\nchange or actions taken to mitigate\nclimate change expose the Corporation to\neconomic, operational or reputational\nharm. Climate-related risks are divided\ninto two major categories, both of which\nspan across the seven key risk types\ndiscussed in Managing Risk on page 44:\n(1) Physical Risk: risks related to the\nphysical impacts of climate change,\ndriven by extreme weather events such as\nhurricanes and floods, as well as\nchronic longer-term shifts such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels, and (2) Transition Risk:\nrisks related to the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, which may entail\nextensive policy, legal, technology and\nmarket changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor vendors. Transition risks of climate\nchange may amplify credit risks through\nthe financial impacts of changes in\npolicy, technology or the market on the\nCorporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk. Reputational\nrisk can arise if we do not meet our\nclimate-related commitments and/or\ngoals, or are perceived to be\ninadequately responsive to climate\nchange or otherwise.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the ERC and the\nCorporate Governance, ESG and\nSustainability Committee (CGESC) of the\nBoard, which regularly discuss climate-\nrelated topics. The ERC oversees climate\nrisk as set forth in our Risk Framework\nand Risk Appetite Statement. The CGESC\nis responsible for overseeing the\nCorporation\u2019s environmental and social\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s climate-related work and\npolicies. The Climate Risk Council\nconsists of leaders across risk, FLU and\ncontrol functions, and meets routinely\nto discuss our approach to managing\nclimate-related risks.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by an officer who reports to\nthe CRO. The Corporation has a Climate\nand Environmental Risk Management\nfunction that is responsible for\noverseeing climate risk management. They\nare\n\nresponsible for establishing the Climate\nRisk Framework and governance structure,\nand providing independent assessment and\nchallenge of enterprise-wide climate\nrisks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, in 2023 we created our\ninternal Climate Risk Framework, which\naddresses how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes and\nalso includes examples of how it\nmanifests across the seven risk types.\nIt details the roles and\nresponsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense as noted above.\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see Managing Risk on page 44.\nFor more information on climate risk,\nsee Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 8.\n                                                                                  \n  Climate-related Goals and Targets                                               \n                                                                                  \nIn 2021, the Corporation committed to\nachieving net zero greenhouse gas\nemissions before 2050 in our financing\nactivities, operations and supply chain\n(Net Zero goal), and in 2022, we\nreleased our Approach to Zero TM , a\nframework for how we plan to achieve our\nNet Zero goal. In line with this\napproach, we have set interim 2030\ntargets across our financing activities\n(2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets), operations and supply chain,\nall of which are further supported and\ncomplemented by our $1.5 trillion\nsustainable finance goal (which is\naligned with the 17 UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals) of which $1 trillion\nis dedicated to supporting the\ntransition toward a low-carbon economy,\nincluding capital mobilized across clean\nenergy sectors and tailored financial\nsolutions for emerging areas of the low-\ncarbon economy. In particular, we\nannounced 2030 Financing Activity\nEmissions Targets for auto\nmanufacturing, aviation, cement, energy,\nand power generation sectors and expect\nto continue to set targets for other\nsectors that are significant\ncontributors to global greenhouse gas\nemissions and therefore prioritized by\nus.\n\nAchieving our climate--related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero goal and\n2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets, may require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, better emissions data\nreporting, new standards and public\npolicies, including those that improve\nthe cost of capital for the transition\nto a low-carbon economy, as well as\nstrong and active engagement with\ncustomers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders. Given the extended period\nof these and other climate-related goals\nwe have established, our initiatives\nhave not resulted in a significant\neffect on our results of operations or\nfinancial position in the relevant\nperiods presented herein.\n\nFor more information on climate-related\nmatters and the Corporation\u2019s climate-\nrelated goals and commitments, including\nplans to achieve its Net Zero goal and\n2030 Financing Activity Emissions\nTargets and progress on its sustainable\nfinance goals, see the Corporation\u2019s\nwebsite, including its 2023 Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) Report.

We have procedures and\nprocesses in place to facilitate making\nthese judgments.\n\nThe more judgmental estimates are\nsummarized in the following discussion.\nWe have identified and described the\ndevelopment of the variables most\nimportant in the estimation processes\nthat involve mathematical models to\nderive the estimates. In many cases,\nthere are numerous alternative judgments\nthat could be used in the process of\ndetermining the inputs to the models.\nWhere alternatives exist, we have used\nthe factors that we believe represent\nthe most reasonable value in developing\nthe inputs. Actual performance that\ndiffers from our estimates of the key\nvariables could materially impact our\nresults of operations. Separate from the\npossible future impact to our results of\noperations from input and model\nvariables, the value of our lending\nportfolio and market-sensitive assets\nand liabilities may change subsequent to\nthe balance sheet date, often\nsignificantly, due to the nature and\nmagnitude of future credit and market\nconditions. Such credit and market\nconditions may change quickly and in\nunforeseen ways and the resulting\nvolatility could have a significant,\nnegative effect on future operating\nresults. These fluctuations would not be\nindicative of deficiencies in our models\nor inputs.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses includes\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nand the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Our process for determining\nthe allowance for credit losses is\ndiscussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe determination of the allowance for\ncredit losses is based on numerous\nestimates and assumptions, which require\na high degree of judgment and are often\ninterrelated. A critical judgment in the\nprocess is the weighting of our forward-\nlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are\nincorporated into our quantitative\nmodels. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation\nuses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in\nits ECL calculation, which have included\na baseline\n\nscenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario\nreflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall economic outlook is weighted\ntowards a recessionary environment in\nthe first half of 2024, with lower gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth and higher\nunemployment rate expectations as\ncompared to what we experienced in the\nprior year. Generally, as the consensus\nestimates improve or deteriorate, the\nallowance for credit losses will change\nin a similar direction. There are\nmultiple variables that drive the\nmacroeconomic scenarios with the key\nvariables including, but not limited to,\nU.S. GDP and unemployment rates. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nat 5.6 percent, 5.0 percent and 4.5\npercent in the fourth quarters of 2023,\n2024 and 2025, respectively, and the\nweighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S.\nGDP was forecasted to contract 0.4\npercent and grow 1.2 percent and 1.9\npercent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe latest consensus estimates for the\nU.S. average unemployment rate for the\nfourth quarter of 2023 was 3.9 percent\nand U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 2.6\npercent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, reflecting a tighter\nlabor market and healthy growth compared\nto our macroeconomic outlook as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and were factored\ninto our allowance for credit losses\nestimate as of December 31, 2023. In\naddition, as of December 31, 2023, the\nweighted macroeconomic outlook for the\nU.S. average unemployment rate was\nforecasted at 4.9 percent in the fourth\nquarters of both 2024 and 2025, and the\nweighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S.\nGDP was forecasted to grow 0.3 percent\nand 1.4 percent year-over-year in the\nfourth quarters of 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn addition to the above judgments and\nestimates, the allowance for credit\nlosses can also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset quality\nof the portfolio, such as increases or\ndecreases in credit and/or internal risk\nratings in our commercial portfolio,\nimprovement or deterioration in borrower\ndelinquencies or credit scores in our\ncredit card portfolio and increases or\ndecreases in home prices, which is a\nprimary driver of LTVs, in our consumer\nreal estate portfolio, all of which have\nsome degree of uncertainty. The\nallowance for credit losses increased to\n$14.6 billion from $14.2 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to a\nreserve build in our\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \nconsumer portfolio driven by credit card\nloan growth and asset quality, partially\noffset by a reserve release in our\ncommercial portfolio primarily driven by\nimproved macroeconomic conditions\napplicable to the commercial portfolio.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the\nsensitivity of the macroeconomic\nscenarios and other assumptions on the\nestimate of our allowance for credit\nlosses, the Corporation compared the\nDecember 31, 2023 modeled ECL from the\nbaseline scenario and our adverse\nscenario. Relative to the baseline\nscenario, the adverse scenario assumed a\npeak U.S. unemployment rate of over two\npercentage points higher than the\nbaseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP\nfollowed by a prolonged recovery and a\nlower home price outlook with a\ndifference of approximately 16 percent\nat the trough. This sensitivity analysis\nresulted in a hypothetical increase in\nthe allowance for credit losses of\napproximately $3.8 billion.\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be\nuseful to understand how changes in\nmacroeconomic assumptions could impact\nour modeled ECLs, it is not meant to\nforecast how our allowance for credit\nlosses is expected to change in a\ndifferent macroeconomic outlook.\nImportantly, the analysis does not\nincorporate a variety of factors,\nincluding qualitative reserves and the\nweighting of alternate scenarios, which\ncould have offsetting effects on the\nestimate. Considering the variety of\nfactors contemplated when developing and\nweighting macroeconomic outlooks such as\nrecent economic events, leading economic\nindicators, views of internal and third-\nparty economists and industry trends, in\naddition to other qualitative factors,\nthe Corporation believes the allowance\nfor credit losses at December 31, 2023\nis appropriate.\n                                                                                  \n   Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                            \n                                                                                  \nUnder applicable accounting standards,\nwe are required to maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use\nof unobservable inputs in measuring fair\nvalue. We classify fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments\nand MSRs based on the three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy in the accounting\nstandards.\n\nThe fair values of assets and\nliabilities may include adjustments,\nsuch as market liquidity and credit\nquality, where appropriate. Valuations\nof products using models or other\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions\nused for the significant inputs. Where\nmarket data is available, the inputs\nused for valuation reflect that\ninformation as of our valuation date.\nInputs to valuation models are\nconsidered unobservable if they are\nsupported by little or no market\nactivity. In periods of extreme\n\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in\nilliquid markets, there may be more\nvariability in market pricing or a lack\nof market data to use in the valuation\nprocess. In keeping with the prudent\napplication of estimates and management\njudgment in determining the fair value\nof assets and liabilities, we have in\nplace various processes and controls\nthat include: a model validation policy\nthat requires review and approval of\nquantitative models used for deal\npricing, financial statement fair value\ndetermination and risk quantification; a\ntrading product valuation policy that\nrequires verification of all traded\nproduct valuations; and a periodic\nreview and substantiation of daily\nprofit and loss reporting for all traded\nproducts. Primarily through validation\ncontrols, we utilize both broker and\npricing service inputs which can and do\ninclude both market-observable and\ninternally-modeled values and/or\nvaluation inputs. Our reliance on this\ninformation is affected by our\nunderstanding of how the broker and/or\npricing service develops its data with a\nhigher degree of reliance applied to\nthose that are more directly observable\nand lesser reliance applied to those\ndeveloped through their own internal\nmodeling. For example, broker quotes in\nless active markets may only be\nindicative and therefore less reliable.\nThese processes and controls are\nperformed independently of the business.\nFor more information, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements and Note 21 \u2013 Fair\nValue Option to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities                                                  \n                                                                                  \nFinancial assets and liabilities, and\nMSRs, where values are based on\nvaluation techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement are classified as Level 3\nunder the fair value hierarchy\nestablished in applicable accounting\nstandards. The fair value of these Level\n3 financial assets and liabilities and\nMSRs is determined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be\nhedged with derivatives classified as\nLevel 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses\nassociated with Level 3 financial\ninstruments may be offset by gains or\nlosses associated with financial\ninstruments classified in other levels\nof the fair value hierarchy.

We completed our annual\ngoodwill impairment test as of June 30,\n2023, by performing a quantitative\nassessment to compare the fair value of\neach reporting unit to its carrying\nvalue as measured by allocated equity.\nBased on our assessment, we have\nconcluded that goodwill was not\nimpaired.\n\nThe Corporation chose to perform the\nquantitative assessment as compared to a\nqualitative assessment that was\nperformed in the prior year due to the\nlevel of interest rates and other market\nconditions existing at June 30, 2023.\nThe quantitative assessment used a\ncombination of an income approach (which\nutilizes the present value of cash flows\nto estimate fair value) and a market\nmultiplier approach (which utilizes\nobservable market prices and metrics of\npeer companies to estimate fair value).\nThe main assumptions used in the income\napproach are the Corporation\u2019s three-\nyear internal forecasts along with long-\nterm terminal growth values. The main\nassumptions used in the market\nmultiplier approach are primarily\nenterprise value and equity multiples\nfrom comparable publicly traded\ncompanies in industries similar to the\nreporting

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of\nthe Corporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2023 based on the framework set forth by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\nin Internal Control \u2013 Integrated\nFramework (2013) .

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and on the Corporation's\ninternal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect\nto the Corporation in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an\n\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such\nother procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n                                                                                  \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and\nthat (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses -\nCommercial and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,\nexcluding loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\nvalue option. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nwas $13.3 billion on total loans and\nleases of $1,050.2 billion, which\nexcludes loans accounted for under the\nfair value option. For commercial and\nconsumer card loans, the expected credit\nloss is typically estimated using\nquantitative methods that consider a\nvariety of factors such as historical\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nloss experience, the current credit\nquality of the portfolio as well as an\neconomic outlook over the life of the\nloan. In its loss forecasting framework,\nthe Corporation incorporates forward\nlooking information through the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the\nforecasted life of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include\nvariables that have historically been\nkey drivers of increases and decreases\nin credit losses. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices,\ngross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen and the weighting given\nto each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic\nevents, leading economic indicators,\nviews of internal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends. Also\nincluded in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses are qualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are expected but, in\nthe Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions.\nFactors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal\nand regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation\nconsiders the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built on\nhistorical data.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and\nlease losses for the commercial and\nconsumer card portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndeveloping lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios and related weightings to each\nscenario, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and\nin evaluating audit evidence obtained,\nand (ii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding controls over the evaluation\nand approval of models, forecast\nscenarios and related weightings, and\nqualitative reserves. These procedures\nalso included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the\nallowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the loss forecast\nmodels and methodology, (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of certain\nmacroeconomic variables, (iii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s development, selection and\nweighting of lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios used in the loss forecast\nmodels, (iv) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the\nestimate, and (v) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves made to the model output\nresults to determine the overall\nallowance for loan and lease losses. The\nprocedures also included the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in evaluating\nthe appropriateness of certain loss\nforecast models, the reasonableness of\neconomic forecast scenarios\n\nand related weightings and the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves.\n\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial\nInstruments\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCorporation carries certain financial\ninstruments at fair value, which\nincludes $9.3 billion of assets and $6.6\nbillion of liabilities classified as\nLevel 3 fair value measurements that are\nvalued on a recurring basis and $3.9\nbillion of assets classified as Level 3\nfair value measurements that are valued\non a nonrecurring basis, for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation. The Corporation determines\nthe fair value of Level 3 financial\ninstruments using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. Unobservable inputs, such\nas volatility or implied yield, may be\ndetermined using quantitative-based\nextrapolations, pricing models or other\ninternal methodologies which incorporate\nmanagement estimates and available\nmarket information.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the valuation of certain\nLevel 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment and estimation used\nby management to determine the fair\nvalue of these financial instruments,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and\neffort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained,\nincluding the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe valuation of financial instruments,\nincluding controls related to valuation\nmodels, significant unobservable inputs,\nand data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a\nsample of these certain financial\ninstruments and comparison of\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair\nvalue. Developing the independent\nestimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data\nprovided by management and evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nsignificant unobservable

      \nNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout\nthe U.S. and in certain international markets. The term \u201cthe Corporation\u201d as used\nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and\nits majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where\nthe Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions\nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included\nfrom the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation\nbecame the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are\nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts\nfor investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include\nthe Corporation\u2019s interests in affordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject\nto impairment testing, and the Corporation\u2019s proportionate share of income or loss\nis included in other income. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially\ndiffer from those estimates and assumptions. New Accounting Standards Issued\nSegment Reporting The FASB amended the segment reporting requirements to add\ndisclosures of incremental segment expense categories. The amended disclosures are\neffective for the fiscal year December 31, 2024, and interim periods thereafter,\non a retrospective basis. Income Taxes The FASB expanded the income tax disclosure\nrequirements related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.\nThe amended disclosures are effective January 1, 2025, on a prospective basis. New\nAccounting Standard Adopted Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses On January 1,\n2023, the Corporation adopted the new accounting and disclosure requirements for\nexpected credit losses (ECL) that removed the recognition and measurement guidance\non troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and added disclosures on the financial\neffect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nUpon adoption of the standard, the Corporation recorded a reduction of $\n243million in the allowance for credit losses for the impact of changes in the\nmethodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses for non-collateral\ndependent consumer and commercial TDRs. There was no impact to the valuation of\nloans previously classified as collateral-dependent TDRs. After adjusting for\ndeferred taxes, the Corporation recorded an increase of $ 184million in retained\nearnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The additional disclosures are\nincluded in Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses\non a prospective basis and include loan modifications where the contractual\npayment terms of the borrower\u2019s loan agreement were modified through a refinancing\nor restructuring. Significant Accounting Principles Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash\nand cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of\ncollection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and\namounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain\nnon-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or\nusage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\nSecurities Financing Agreements Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements\nto resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities\nfinancing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except\nin instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual\nsale and purchase transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at\nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances where the interest\nis negative, the Corporation\u2019s policy is to present negative interest on financial\nassets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as\ninterest expense. For securities financing agreements that are accounted for under\nthe fair value option, the changes in the fair value of these securities financing\nagreements are recorded in market making and similar activities in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation\u2019s policy is to monitor the\nmarket value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain\ncollateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate.\nSecurities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these\ncollateral provisions; therefore, any allowance for loan losses is insignificant.\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending\nagreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it\nrecognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing\nthe securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return\nthose securities. Trading Instruments Financial instruments utilized in trading\nactivities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted\nmarket prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market\nprices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes,\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where\nthe determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or\nestimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America94                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndate basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market\nmaking and similar activities. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are\nentered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management\nactivities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives\nthat are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and\nderivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in\nqualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management\nactivities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange\nrate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives\nutilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement\ncontracts, and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle\npositive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on\nquoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable\nmarket-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on\ndealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar\ntechniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities\nreflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These\nvalues also take into account the Corporation\u2019s own credit standing. Trading\nDerivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for trading\npurposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making\nand similar activities. Derivatives used for other risk management activities are\nincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other\nrisk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated\npertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the\neffect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which\nthe risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to\nthe extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to\nmitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest\nrate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS)\nthat are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and\nforeign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities. Credit\nderivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with\nvarious credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nincluded in market making and similar activities and other income. Derivatives\nUsed For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the\nCorporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging\ninstruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the\nCorporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for\neach reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an\naccounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in\noffsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted\ntransaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined\nthat a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a\nhedge. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of\nthe Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or\nforeign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated\nas fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income\nstatement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If\na derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge\ndesignation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged\nasset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other\ncomponents of the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to\nearnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability. Cash flow\nhedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and\nliabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange\nrate fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price\nrisk associated with deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income\nstatement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item\naffects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge\neffectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged\nitem. Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate\nsensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the\nspot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign\noperations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining\ncomponents of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and\nare recorded in market making and similar activities. Securities Debt securities\nare reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their\nclassification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired.\nDebt securities purchased for use in the Corporation\u2019s trading activities are\nreported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses\nincluded in market making and similar activities. Substantially all other debt\nsecurities purchased are used in the Corporation\u2019s asset and liability management\n(ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt\nsecurities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities.\nDebt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS)\nsecurities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI\nor carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market\nmaking and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that\nmanagement has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at\namortized cost. If more than 85percent of the principal has been collected\n                                                                                  \n  95Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \non level-payment mortgage-backed HTM debt securities since their acquisition, the\ndebt securities, if disposed, are treated as matured for classification purposes.\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below\namortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely\nthan not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to\nfair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to\nhold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL, except for debt\nsecurities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or\nsovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero\ncredit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation\nconsiders qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and\nthe value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the\nqualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation\nto determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL. The\nCorporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit\nloss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt\nsecurities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses.\nCash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information\navailable such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying\ncollateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that\namount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may\nexceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is\nlimited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the\nasset. The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit\nlosses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the\nremaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to\nestimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are\namortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the\ncontractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales or\ndispositions of debt securities are determined using the specific identification\nmethod. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held\nfor trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses\nincluded in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable\nfair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying\nobservable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets. Loans and\nLeases Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value\noption, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred\nfees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any\nunamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct\norigination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income\nover the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are\namortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation\nelects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value\noption with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value\nreported in market making and similar activities or other income. Under applicable\naccounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is\ncategorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of\nfinancing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an\nentity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance\nfor credit losses, and a class of financing receivable is defined as the level of\ndisaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute,\nrisk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2019s\nthreeportfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer,\nand Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are\nresidential mortgage and home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other\nConsumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other\nconsumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial,\nnon-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S.\nsmall business commercial. Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to\nits customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases\nand sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable\nplus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income,\nwhich is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that\napproximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain\nnon-lease components. Allowance for Credit Losses The ECL on funded consumer and\ncommercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\nbinding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to\nthe loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance\nfor credit losses to the current estimate of ECL. For loans and leases, the ECL is\ntypically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as\nwell as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for\nclosed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted\nfor any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension\noptions that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open- ended products\n(e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term\nassociated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation\ndoes not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic\nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases\nand decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America96                                                               \n                                                                                  \nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal\nand third-party economists and industry trends. The estimate of credit losses\nincludes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative\nallowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan\nare not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash\nflows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the\ncharge-off. Included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative\nreserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors\nsuch as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further,\nthe Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are\nbuilt on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit card\nportfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in\nthe measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally\nclassifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90days past due and reverses\ninterest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the\ninterest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was\noriginally recorded. The Corporation has identified the following threeportfolio\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\nConsumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential\nreal estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over\nthe life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments,\nusing quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most\nsignificant in estimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are\nfurther broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current,\ndelinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\nCorporation\u2019s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect\nthe economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real\nestate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss\nestimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and\nlong-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records\na reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn\nportion of the Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation\nif certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending\ncommitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and\nincorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For loans that are more\nthan 180days past due, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair\nvalue of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell.\nThe fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined\nusing an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by\nreference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends\nspecific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued\nis located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation\nutilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations,\nthe Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair\nvalue of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations,\nthe Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the\naggregate. For loans that are more than 180days past due, with the exception of\nthe Corporation\u2019s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that\nis in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is\ncharged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to\nthe initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;\nhowever, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a\nlevel above the cumulative charge-off amount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount\nand timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,\nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable\nbalance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending\nbehavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the\neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in\naccordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act\nof 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then\nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it\nis brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook,\nborrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all\nkey inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on\nthe credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally\ncancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined\nusing quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The\nquantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan\ncharacteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,\nunderlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The ECL on commercial\nloans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan\u2019s\ncontractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms\nto forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected\nprepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes\nin funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw and payment\nbehavior over the\n                                                                                  \n  97Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nremaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real\nestate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the\nloss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV\nratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in\nbehavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment\nrate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to\ndetermine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL\nestimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model\ndetermines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or\ndefault at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower\u2019s current\ncredit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic\nmarket. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral\nsecuring the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower\u2019s industry sector,\nany guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are\nconditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic\nvariables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond\nspreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns. In addition\nto the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL\nrelated to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial\nguarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for\nthe unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded\nexposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans\nand leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported\nas nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged\noff against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later\nrecovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the\nrecovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If\nrecoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net charge-offs are\nreported as a negative amount. In accordance with the Corporation\u2019s policies,\nconsumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home\nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming at 90days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the\nFHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae\n(FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage\nloans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and,\ntherefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are\nplaced on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying\nfirst-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past due even if the junior-lien loan is\ncurrent. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of\nthe estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the\nend of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan is\nfully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of\nnotification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan\nbecomes 180days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest\nuntil they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming\nloans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become\n90days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or\ndeath or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are charged off to their\ncollateral values when the loans become 120days past due, upon repossession of the\ncollateral, within 60days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or\nupon confirmation of fraud. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the\nloans are fully charged off. Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card\nloans, that are past due 90days or more as to principal or interest, or where\nreasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are\nindividually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer\ncredit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off\nwhen all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually\ndelinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the\ncustomer\u2019s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due\nloans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if\napplicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are\nplaced on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases\nfor which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as\nprincipal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when\nreceived. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal\nand interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal\nand interest is expected. Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation intends\nto sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan\nsyndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and\nother loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost\nor fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential\nmortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS\ncarried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying\nvalue of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the\ngain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are\nreported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported\nseparately from nonperforming loans and leases. Premises and Equipment Premises\nand equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40years for\nbuildings, up to 12years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease\nterm or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Other Assets For the\nCorporation\u2019s financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not\nincluded in debt securities or loans\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America98                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these\nassets for ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral\nmaintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily\nmargining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be\nmaintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be\nzero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses,\nincluding consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to\nestimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded\nas a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. Lessee\nArrangements Substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s lessee arrangements are\noperating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are\nreported in other assetson the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease\nliabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are\nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less\nthan 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded\nin occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The\nCorporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and\nequipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and\nnon-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized\nbased on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using\nthe Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal\nthe lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease\ncommencement and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill\nis the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual\nbasis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the\nreporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a\nbusiness segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit\nagainst its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated\nequity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity\nin the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses\nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors\ninclude, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other\nrelevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If the Corporation\nconcludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The\nCorporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\nany reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the\nqualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing the quantitative\nassessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,\ngoodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss\nwould be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s allocated equity\nexceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of\ngoodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis\nin the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not\npermitted under applicable accounting guidance. For intangible assets subject to\namortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the\nintangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of\nthe intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the\nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible\nassets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An\nimpairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with\nan indefinite life exceeds its fair value. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an\nentity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a\ncontrolling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The\nCorporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities\nof the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and an\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation\nreassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in\ngoverning documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation\nstatus of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result\nof such reassessments. The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization\nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into\na trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held\nin a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity\nloans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the\nmost significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have\nthe power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage\nagency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds\nsubstantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to\nliquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a\ncommercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer\nor by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain\ncontrolling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust\nif it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds\nsecurities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than\nstandard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to\nthe trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS\nsecurities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation\nconsolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the\nongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities\nor, if\n                                                                                  \n  99Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nthere are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust,\nincluding the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure\nof securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other\ncommitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation\ndoes not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a\nlimited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the\ntrust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through\nliquidation or other substantive rights. Other VIEs used by the Corporation\ninclude collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on\nbehalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not\nroutinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically\nhave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the\nCorporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires\nthe power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. The\nCorporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control\nover the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and\nalso absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the\nvehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not\nconsolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial\ndesign of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation\ndoes not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the\nvehicle. Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair\nvalue. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by\nunconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as\ntrading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities,\nare based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.\nGenerally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available;\ntherefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the\nassociated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The Corporation measures the\nfair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with\naccounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.\nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under\napplicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one\nof three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest\npriority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest\npriority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy. Level 1\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S.\nTreasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or\nother inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data\nfor substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and\nliabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less\nfrequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair\nvalue is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the\nmarket or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market\ndata. This category generally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed\n(MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative\ncontracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported\nby little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value\nof the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial\ninstruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities\nis generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies\nor similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained\nresidual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly\nstructured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS,\nIRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained\nfor a significant portion of the underlying assets. Income Taxes There are two\ncomponents of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense\nreflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax\nexpense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between\nperiods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or\nincreases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals\nof temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax\nlaws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets\nare also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards\nand tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred\ntax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be\nrealized. Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step\nmodel: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based\nsolely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit\nis measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than\nnot to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized\nand the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax\nbenefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if\napplicable, within income tax expense. Revenue Recognition The following\nsummarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies for certain\nnoninterest income activities. Card Income Card income includes annual, late and\nover-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous\nitems from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card\ntransactions for merchants. Card income is presented net\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America100                                                              \n                                                                                  \nof direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and\ndebit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis\nfor credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding\npayment network\u2019s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the\ntransaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which\nare recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are\nestimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments.\nRewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that\ncan be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift\ncards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior,\ncard product type, account transaction activity and other historical card\nperformance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation\nalso makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-\nsharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and\npartner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card\npartner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card\npartner\u2019s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation. Service Charges\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees\nconsist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are\ngenerally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed.\nConsumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and\nvarious transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer\nactivities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft\ntransactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation\u2019s Global\nTransaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury\nmanagement services, including account maintenance and other services, such as\npayroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees\ngenerally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments,\nfinancial guarantees and SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage Services Investment and\nbrokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset\nmanagement fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory\nagreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\u2019s financial advisors\n(collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees\nare earned as a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and generally range from 50 basis\npoints (bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain\na client\u2019s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded\nnet and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent\nfor those services. Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based\nservices that are performed as part of investment management services and are\nbased on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction\namount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that\nare primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are\nearned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage\nfees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various\nfinancial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears\ntransactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker.\nCertain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant\nregulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are\nrecorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is\nan agent for those services. Investment Banking Income Investment banking income\nincludes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting\nconsists of fees earned for the placement of a customer\u2019s debt or equity\nsecurities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed\nnumber of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is\ndetermined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The\nCorporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in\nperforming these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the\nCorporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses.\nSyndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for\nstructuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication. Financial advisory\nservices consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to\nmergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on\nthe size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally\ncontingent on successful completion of the transaction. Revenue is typically\nrecognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered.\nAdditionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition\ntransactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the\nopinion is delivered to the client. Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition\nPolicies The Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance\nobligations at December 31, 2023, as its contracts with customers generally have a\nfixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period\nthat is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize\nrevenue at the amount it has the right to invoice. Earnings Per Common Share\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to\ncommon shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding\nunvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated\nto common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends\nincluding dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including\naccelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative\ndividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of\nperiod end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on\ndilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to\nexercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts\nrepresenting the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting\nfrom the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.\n                                                                                  \n  101Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nForeign Currency Translation Assets,\nliabilities and operations of foreign\nbranches and subsidiaries are recorded\nbased on the functional currency of each\nentity. When the functional currency of\na foreign operation is the local\ncurrency, the assets, liabilities and\noperations are translated, for\nconsolidation purposes, from the local\ncurrency to the U.S. dollar reporting\ncurrency at period-end rates for\n\nassets and liabilities and generally at\naverage rates for results of operations.\nThe resulting unrealized gains and\nlosses are reported as a component of\naccumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the\nforeign entity\u2019s functional currency is\nthe U.S. dollar, the resulting\nremeasurement gains or losses on foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets or\nliabilities are included in earnings.\n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for 2023, 2022 and 2021.

enters into International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar\nagreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative counterparties.\nWhere legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation\noffsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nfollowing table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 and 2022 by\nprimary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on\nwhich these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis,\nprior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross\nderivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which\ninclude reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received\nor paid.

Interest rate, foreign\nexchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's\nALM and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest\nrate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate\ncontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis\nswaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in\nearnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage\ninterest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest\nrate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or\ndepreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are\nlinked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to\nsubstantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk,\nincluding interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market\nrisk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or\nrevenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking\nproduction income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and\nother derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt\nsecurities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate\noptions, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures\nto hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will\nincrease or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest\nrates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit\nrisk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives\ninclude credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives Designated as\nAccounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its\nassets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange\nrates (fair value hedges).

Of the $ 8.0billion after-tax net loss ($ 10.7billion pretax) on\nderivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2023, losses of $ 3.4billion after-\ntax ($ 4.6billion pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are\nexpected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses\nreclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income\nrelated to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately ten\nyears. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted\ntransactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately five years,\nwith the aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant. On\nNovember 15, 2023, Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced the permanent\ncessation of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) and all its tenors\neffective after final publication on November 15, 2024. The Corporation determined\nthat certain forecasted BSBY-indexed interest payments, which had been designated\nin cash flow hedges, were no longer expected to occur beyond November 15, 2024 as\nthey will transition to a new reference rate. Accordingly, during the fourth\nquarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $ 2.0billion of pretax loss from\naccumulated OCI into market making and similar activities for the amount related\nto these forecasted transactions.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America106                                                              \n

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 4.1billion and $ 4.8billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure\nto the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.2billion and $\n4.9billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of\nthe transferred securities was $ 4.1billion and $ 4.7billion. Sales and Trading\nRevenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and\nliabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to include these derivative\ninstruments in its trading activities,\n\nwhich include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk\nfrom these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the\nCorporation\u2019s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading\nrevenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement\nline items, including market making and similar activities and net interest income\nas well as other revenue categories. Sales and trading revenue includes changes in\nthe fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other\nassets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity\nsecurities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an\ninstrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the\ndealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales\nare recorded in the \u201cOther\u201d column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes\nin the fair value of these securities are included in market making and similar\nactivities. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest\nassociated with the debt securities, is typically included in market making and\nsimilar activities. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue\nrelated to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the\npricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee\narrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market making and similar\nactivities as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the\nmajority of revenue is included in market making and similar activities. In\ntransactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded\nfutures and options, fees are recorded in other income . The following table,\nwhich includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies\nthe amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the\nCorporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary\nrisk, for 2023, 2022 and 2021. This table includes debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

(2) Includes\ncommodity risk.\n\nCredit Derivatives The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to\nfacilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit\nderivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation\nor a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as\nthe seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence\nof a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of\nthe referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as\nacceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit\nderivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the\nCorporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss\nhas occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.\nCredit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on\nthe credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation\nconsiders ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade\nincludes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses\ninternal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent\nwith how risk is managed for these instruments. Credit derivative instruments\nwhere the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the following table.\n

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading\nsecurities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to\nthe entities under the terms of the securities owned. Credit-related Contingent\nFeatures and Collateral The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative\ncontracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions,\nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of nonfinancial\ncompanies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a\ndaily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending\non the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically\nrequire an increase in the amount of collateral\n                                                                                  \n  109Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nrequired of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to\ntake additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.\nFurther, as previously discussed on page 105, the Corporation enters into legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and\nnetting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain\nevents. Certain of the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-\nrelated contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting\nagreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of\nthese instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty\nwith whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes\nin the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the\nderivative transactions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation held cash\nand securities collateral of $ 104.1billion and $ 101.3billion and posted cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 93.4billion and $ 81.2billion in the normal course of\nbusiness under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements\nwhere clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and\nsecured financing arrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in\nthe event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of\nthe contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to\npost to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $ 2.5billion,\nincluding $ 1.1billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA). Some\ncounterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or\nthe Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such\nas find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.\nThe following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have\nbeen contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements\nat December 31, 2023 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior\ndebt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch\nand by an additional second incremental notch.

The Corporation\ncalculates valuation adjustments on\nderivatives based on a modeled expected\nexposure that incorporates current\nmarket risk factors. The exposure also\ntakes into consideration credit\nmitigants such as enforceable master\nnetting agreements and collateral. CDS\nspread data is used to estimate the\ndefault probabilities and severities\nthat are applied to the exposures. Where\nno observable credit default data is\navailable for counterparties, the\nCorporation uses proxies and other\nmarket data to estimate default\nprobabilities and severity.\nThe table below presents credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA\ngains (losses) on derivatives (excluding\nthe effect of any related hedge\nactivities), which are recorded in\nmarket making and similar activities,\nfor 2023, 2022 and 2021. CVA gains\nreduce the cumulative CVA thereby\nincreasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the\ncumulative DVA thereby decreasing the\nderivative liabilities balance. CVA and\nDVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA\ngains related to derivative assets\nreduce the cumulative FVA thereby\nincreasing the derivative assets\nbalance. FVA gains related to derivative\nliabilities increase the cumulative FVA\nthereby decreasing the derivative\nliabilities balance. FVA losses have the\nopposite impact.\n                                                                                  \n  Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\nWithin the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality\nindicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score.\nRefreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value\nof the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan\nand available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against\nthe property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan,\nrefreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower\nbased on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit\nhistory. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain\nborrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy\nproceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary\ncredit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nand the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal\nclassifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit\nquality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial\nloans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special\nMention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by\nregulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a\nhigh probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not\nconsidered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality\nindicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types\nof loans. The following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross\ncharge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other\nConsumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for\nrevolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are\nshown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2023.\n

Loan\nModifications to Borrowers in Financial Difficulty As part of its credit risk\nmanagement, the Corporation may modify a loan agreement with a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties through a refinancing or restructuring of the\nborrower\u2019s loan agreement (modification programs). The Corporation uses various\nindicators to identify borrowers in financial difficulty. Generally, consumer loan\nborrowers that are delinquent and commercial loan borrowers that are currently\nnonperforming or are more-likely-than-not to become nonperforming in the next six\nmonthsat the modification date are the primary criteria used to identify borrowers\nwho are experiencing financial difficulty. If a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty and their loan is modified, and they are current at the time of\nmodification, the loan generally remains a performing loan as long as there is\ndemonstrated performance prior to the modification and payment in full under the\nmodified terms is expected. Otherwise, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status and\nreported as nonperforming, excluding fully-insured consumer real estate loans,\nuntil there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.\nModifications that do not impact the contractual payment terms, such as covenant\nwaivers, insignificant payment deferrals, and any modifications made to loans\ncarried at fair value, LHFS and leases are not included in the disclosures.\n\nConsumer Real Estate The following modification programs are offered for consumer\nreal estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These\nmodifications represented 0.26percent and 0.34percent of outstanding residential\nmortgage and home equity loans at December 31, 2023. Forbearance and Other Payment\nPlans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the\nborrower\u2019s payments for a defined period with those payments then due at the\nconclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan is generally\nfrozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. Alternatively, the Corporation may\noffer the borrower a payment plan, which allows the borrower to repay past due\namounts through payments over a defined period. At December 31, 2023, the\namortized cost of residential mortgage loans that were modified through these\nplans was $ 429million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that were modified\nthrough these plans during the same periods was $ 57million. The weighted-average\nduration of residential mortgage loan modifications was approximately 8months for\n2023. The weighted-average duration for home equity loan modifications was\napproximately 9months. The total forborne payments for residential mortgage loan\nmodifications was $ 19million for 2023. For the same period, the total forborne\npayments for home equity modifications was $ 6million. If a borrower is unable to\nfulfill their obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial\nor permanent modification. Trial Modifications : Trial modification plans\ngenerally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that\n\nreduce their contractual payments temporarily over a three-to- four-monthtrial\nperiod. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial\nperiod and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become\npermanent. At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of residential mortgage loans\nentering trial modifications was $ 116million. The amortized cost of home equity\nloans entering trial modifications during the same period was $ 34million.\nPermanent Modifications : Permanent modifications include borrowers that have\ncompleted a trial modification and have had their contractual payment terms\npermanently modified, as well as borrowers that proceed directly to a permanent\nmodification without a trial period. In a permanent modification, the borrower\u2019s\npayment terms are typically modified in more than one manner but generally include\na term extension and an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent\nmodification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due\nprincipal and interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations\nutilized are based on modifying the terms that give the borrower an improved\nability to meet the contractual obligations. At December 31, 2023, the amortized\ncost of residential mortgage loans that were granted a permanent modification was\n$ 154million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that were granted a\npermanent modification was $ 31million. The term extensions granted for\nresidential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can\nbe up to 30years, but are mostly in the range of 1to 20years for both residential\nmortgage and home equity loans. The weighted-average term extension of permanent\nmodifications for residential mortgage loans was 9.9years for 2023, while the\nweighted-average interest rate reduction was 1.41percent. For the same period, the\nweighted-average term extension of permanent modifications for home equity loans\nwas 17.7years, while the weighted-average interest rate reduction was 2.74percent.\nPrincipal forgiveness and payment deferrals were insignificant during 2023. For\nconsumer real estate borrowers in financial difficulty that received a\nforbearance, trial or permanent modification, there were no commitments to lend\nadditional funds at December 31, 2023. Borrowers with a home equity line of credit\nthat received a forbearance plan could have all or a portion of their lines\nreinstated in the future if they cure their payment default and meet certain Bank\nconditions. Chapter 7 Discharges: If a borrower\u2019s consumer real estate obligation\nis discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the contractual payment terms\nof the loan are not modified, although they can no longer be enforced against the\nindividual borrower. The Corporation\u2019s ability to collect amounts due on the loan\nis limited to enforcement against the property through the foreclosure and sale of\nthe collateral. The Corporation will only pursue foreclosure upon default by the\nborrower, and otherwise will recover pursuant to the loan terms or at the time of\na sale. Residential mortgage and home equity loans that were granted a Chapter 7\ndischarge were insignificant for 2023. The Corporation tracks the performance of\nmodified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs. Defaults of\nmodified residential mortgage and home equity loans since January 1, 2023 totaled\n$ 287million during 2023.

The carrying value of consumer real estate loans,\nincluding fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 633million and $ 871million. During\n2023 and 2022, the Corporation reclassified $ 106million and $ 190million of\nconsumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired\nupon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured\nloans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing\nactivities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. Credit Card and Other Consumer Credit card and other consumer loans\nare primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a\nsignificantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6months to\n72months. As of December 31, 2023, substantially all payment plans provided to\ncustomers had a 60-monthterm. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will\nforgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to\na set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for\nloans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party\nrenegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt\nstructures (external programs). The December 31, 2023 amortized cost of credit\ncard and other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during\n2023 was $ 598million. The weighted-average interest rate reduction for the\nmodifications was 19.02percent, and principal forgiveness was $ 61million during\n2023. The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess\neffectiveness of modification programs. During 2023, defaults of modified credit\ncard and other consumer loans since January 1, 2023 were insignificant. Of the $\n598million in modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty as of December 31, 2023, $ 491million were\ncurrent, $ 59million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 48million were greater than\n90 days past due. These modifications represented 0.29percent of outstanding\ncredit card and other consumer loans at December 31, 2023. Commercial Loans\nModifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nare designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing borrowers\nwith an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower\u2019s\nindividual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating\nthe Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term\nextensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Bank\nforbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full\n(maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates\nand principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal\nforgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other\nsettlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan. The table below\nprovides the ending amortized cost of commercial loans modified during 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Comme\u2026                                                                          \n  Loans                                                                           \n  -                                                                               \n  Modif\u2026                                                                          \n  to                                                                              \n  Borro\u2026       Term                                                               \n  in           Extens\u2026                                                            \n  Finan\u2026       Year                                                               \n  Diffi\u2026       ended                                                              \n  (Doll\u2026       Decemb\u2026                              Intere\u2026                       \n  in           31,                                  Rate                          \n  Milli\u2026       2023                 Forbe\u2026          Reduct\u2026         Total         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.      $           1,016    $           30  $            \u2014  $         1,046  \n  comme\u2026                                                                          \n  Non-U\u2026                  136                 \u2014              24  $           160  \n  comme\u2026                                                                          \n  Comme\u2026                                                                          \n  real                  1,656               416               \u2014  $         2,072  \n  estate                                                                          \n  Total     $           2,808    $          446  $           24  $         3,278  \n                                                                                  \nTerm extensions granted increased the weighted-average life of the impacted loans\nby 1.6years during 2023.

The following discussion reflects\nloans that were considered TDRs prior to January 1, 2023. For more information on\nTDR accounting policies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples.\n\nConsumer Real Estate The table below presents the December 31, 2022 unpaid\nprincipal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest\nrates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during 2022 and\n2021. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans\nthat were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had\npreviously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.\nBinding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made\nand continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters\ninto a permanent modification. At December 31, 2022, remaining commitments to lend\nadditional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real\nestate TDR were not significant.\n

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer.\n\nCommercial Loans During 2022 , the\ncarrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were modified as\nTDRs was $ 1.9billion compared to $\n1.3billion in 2021 . At December 31,\n2022 and 2021 , the Corporation had\ncommitments to lend $ 358million and $\n283million to commercial borrowers whose\nloans were classified as TDRs. The\nbalance of commercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 105million and $\n262million at December 31, 2022 and 2021\n. Loans Held-for-sale The Corporation\nhad LHFS of $ 6.0billion and $\n6.9billion at December 31, 2023 and\n2022. Cash and non-cash proceeds from\nsales and paydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $ 16.3billion, $\n32.0billion and $ 43.6billion for 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash used\nfor originations and purchases of LHFS\ntotaled $ 15.6billion, $ 24.9billion and\n$ 37.3billion for 2023 , 2022 and 2021 ,\nrespectively. Also included were non-\ncash net transfers into LHFS of $\n632million during 2023, $ 1.9billion\nduring 2022 , primarily driven by the\ntransfer of a $ 1.6billion affinity card\nloan portfolio to held for sale that was\nsold in October 2022, and $ 808million\nduring 2021 .\n\nAccrued Interest Receivable Accrued\ninterest receivable for loans and leases\nand loans held-for-sale at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 was $ 4.5billion and $\n3.8billion and is reported in customer\nand other receivableson the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Outstanding credit card\nloan balances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During 2023 and 2022, the\nCorporation reversed $ 584million and $\n332million of interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item\nin which it was originally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal balance of\nthe loan.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during 2023\nand 2022, interest and fee income\nreversed at the time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America124                                                              \n                                                                                  \nweighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen\neach quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal\nand third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit\nlosses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The December\n31, 2023 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic\nscenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an\nadverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a\ntail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing\nand an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the\nbaseline scenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above scenarios\nhas improved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December\n31, 2022. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment\nrate will be just below fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2024 and will remain\nnear this level through the fourth quarter of 2025. The weighted economic outlook\nassumes a mild recession in the first half of 2024 with U.S. real gross domestic\nproduct forecasted to grow at 0.3percent and at 1.4percent year-over-year in the\nfourth quarters of 2024 and 2025. The allowance for credit losses increased $\n329million from December 31, 2022 to $ 14.6billion at December 31, 2023, which\nincluded a $ 1.3billion reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $\n942million reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio. The increase in\nthe allowance reflected a reserve build in the Corporation\u2019s consumer portfolio\nprimarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a\nreserve release in the Corporation\u2019s commercial portfolio primarily driven by\nimproved macroeconomic conditions applicable to the commercial portfolio. The\nallowance also includes the impact of the accounting change to remove the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on TDRs, which reduced the allowance for\ncredit losses by $ 243million on January 1, 2023. The change in the allowance for\ncredit losses was comprised of a net increase of $ 660million in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and a decrease of $ 331million in the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The provision for credit losses increased $ 1.9billion to an\nexpense of $ 4.4billion in 2023 compared to an expense of $ 2.5billion in 2022 and\nto a benefit of $ 4.6billion in 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses\nin 2023 was driven by the Corporation\u2019s consumer portfolio primarily due to credit\ncard loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by improved macroeconomic\nconditions that primarily benefited the Corporation\u2019s commercial portfolio. The\nincrease in the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan\ngrowth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced COVID-19\npandemic uncertainties. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option increased $ 10.2billion in 2023 driven by consumer\nloans, which increased $ 3.7billion driven by credit card, partially offset by\ndeclines in securities-based lending. Commercial loans increased $ 6.5billion\ndriven by broad-based growth.

customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles. The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities\nof consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 in\nsituations where the Corporation has a loan or security interest and involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest\nin the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 resulting from its\n\ninvolvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with\nassets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses\nassociated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity\ncommitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of\nassets. The Corporation invests in ABS, CLOs and other similar investments issued\nby third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement other than a\nloan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the Corporation also enters\ninto certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities\nsecondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances.\nThese securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013 Securities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included\nin the following tables. The Corporation did not provide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2023, 2022 and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America126                                                              \n                                                                                  \n2021 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it\nintend to do so. The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put\noptions and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $\n989million and $ 978million at December 31, 2023 and 2022. First-lien Mortgage\nSecuritizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation\nsecuritizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates\nor purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-\nbacked securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and\nFHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association\n(GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA)- guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in\nconjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may\nalso securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the\nCorporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates\nor purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it\nsecuritizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity\ntranches issued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the\nsecuritization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. The\ntable below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage\nsecuritizations for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Firs\u2026                                                                           \n  Mort\u2026       Resi\u2026                                                               \n  Secu\u2026       Mort\u2026                                                               \n  (Dol\u2026           -                               Comme\u2026                          \n  in          Agen\u2026                               Mortg\u2026                          \n  mill\u2026        2023        2022        2021         2023        2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Proc\u2026                                                                           \n  from     $  4,513    $  8,084    $  6,664    $   2,132    $  5,853    $  10,8\u2026  \n  loan                                                                            \n  sale\u2026                                                                           \n  Gains                                                                           \n  (los\u2026         -15           8           9           44          46         156  \n  on                                                                              \n  secu\u2026                                                                           \n  Repu\u2026                                                                           \n  from           33          53         756            \u2014           \u2014           \u2014  \n  secu\u2026                                                                           \n  trus\u2026                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations\nsponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and\nprimarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 49million, $\n41million and $ 121million net of hedges, during 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n92.7billion and $ 100.1billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 248million, $ 274million and $\n392million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Servicing advances on\nserviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment,\nwere $ 1.3billion and $ 1.6billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . Home Equity Loans The\nCorporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the\nCorporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a\nrapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure\nin the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result\nof the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity\nlines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the\ntiming of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During 2023\nand 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage\nsecuritization trusts with total assets of $ 685million and $ 784million, with no\nsignificant deconsolidations in 2021.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Credit Card and Automobile Loan\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nand automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are sold on a non-\nrecourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas\nadditional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or\nproceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on the securitization\nstructure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trusts\nincludes servicing the receivables and holding various subordinated interests,\nincluding an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit card receivables and owning\ncertain retained interests. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of\nthe receivables in the trusts totaled $ 16.6billion and $ 14.6billion, which are\nincluded in loans and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities\nthat were issued to third-party investors from the trusts totaled $ 7.8billion and\n$ 4.2billion, which are included in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The\nCorporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed\nin a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 8.6billion, $ 21.8billion and\n$ 28.9billion of securities during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Securities\ntransferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the\nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded.\nSecurities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair\nvalue of $ 2.4billion, $ 2.4billion and $ 2.2billion during 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets. Substantially all of the trading account\nsecurities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and\ncommodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are\ntypically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit\nexposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The\nCorporation\u2019s involvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer\nVIEs totaled $ 952million and $ 914million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nincluding the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment,\nif any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation\nadministers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate\nmunicipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust\ncertificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party\ninvestors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal\nbond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $\n1.7billion and $ 2.5billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The weighted-average\nremaining\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America128                                                              \n                                                                                  \nlife of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2023 was 12.2years. There were no\nsignificant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2023, 2022 and\n2021. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities,\ntypically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple\ntranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party\nportfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs,\nholds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the\nCDOs. The Corporation maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated\nCDOs totaled $ 80million and $ 197million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInvestment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which\nmay be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that\nhold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are\ndesigned to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $ 472million and $ 854 million. The\nCorporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $\n18.4billion and $ 14.8billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated\ninvestment VIEs totaled $ 2.6billion and $ 3.0billion at December 31, 2023 and\n2022 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.\nLeveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment in consolidated leveraged\nlease trusts totaled $ 1.1billion and $ 1.2billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and\ndistribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the\ntrusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents\nthe Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that\nthe leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged\nlease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The table below summarizes the\nmaximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation that related to other\nasset-backed VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n

limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these\nunconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 84.1billion and $ 74.8billion as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an\ninvestor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are\nallocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and\nrelated regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which\nvaries based on the type of investments. Tax credits from investments in\naffordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax\ncredits from renewable energy investments are recognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for\ntransactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a\n10-year\n                                                                                  \n  129Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \ntime period.

The Corporation may be asked\nto invest additional amounts to support\na troubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant. During 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nthe Corporation recognized tax credits\nand other tax benefits related to\naffordable housing and other tax credit\nequity investments of $ 1.9billion, $\n1.5billion and $ 1.3billion, and\nreported pretax losses in other income\nof $ 1.5billion, $ 1.2billion and $\n1.1billion. The Corporation\u2019s equity\ninvestments in renewable energy totaled\n$ 14.2billion and $ 13.9billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition,\nthe Corporation had unfunded capital\ncontributions for renewable energy\ninvestments of $ 6.2billion and $\n1.9billion at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, which are contingent on various\nconditions precedent to funding over the\nnext two years.

Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and\nRestricted Cash\n\nThe Corporation enters into securities financing agreements which include\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned\nor sold under agreements to repurchase. These financing agreements (also referred\nto as \u201cmatched-book transactions\u201d) are to accommodate customers, obtain securities\nto cover short positions and finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects\nto account for certain securities financing agreements under the fair value\noption. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value\nOption . Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements Substantially all of the\nCorporation\u2019s securities financing activities are transacted under legally\nenforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities\nlending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of\n\ndefault by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset\nreceivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets\nsecurities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and\nthe transactions have the same maturity date. The Securities Financing Agreements\ntable presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Balances are\npresented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting.\nGross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

equal to or in excess of the principal amount borrowed. For\nsecurities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of\ncash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value\nof the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued\ndaily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may\nreceive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and\nsecurities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e.,\nno stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to\nthese agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties,\nproviding a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when\nappropriate. Short-term Borrowings The Corporation classifies borrowings with an\noriginal maturity of less than one year as short-term borrowings on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the majority of short-\nterm borrowings consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which totaled $\n13.2billion and $ 9.2billion, and commercial paper, which totaled $ 13.1billion\nand $ 9.9billion. Collateral The Corporation accepts securities and loans as\ncollateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of this collateral was $ 911.3billion\nand $ 827.6billion, of which $ 870.9billion and $ 764.1billion were sold or\nrepledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell. The Corporation also pledges company-owned\nsecurities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and\nloan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be\nsold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically\ndisclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain cases, the Corporation has\ntransferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as\ncollateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs. In addition, the\nCorporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts.\nRequired collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type\nof counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of\ncash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on\nprovisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash\ncollateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges\ncollateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative\nliabilities.

For more information, see Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable\nInterest Entities.\n(3) Includes debt outstanding of $ 10.0billion and $ 8.0billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 that was issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance\nsubsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, the parent company, and is fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by the parent company.\nDuring 2023, the Corporation issued $ 62.0billion of long-term debt consisting of\n$ 24.0billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 25.1billion of\nnotes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 12.9billion of other debt. During\n2022, the Corporation issued $ 66.0billion of long-term debt consisting of $\n44.2billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 10.0billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 11.8billion of other debt. During 2023, the\nCorporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate\nof $ 42.7billion consisting of $ 25.3billion for Bank of America Corporation, $\n10.5billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 6.9billion of other debt. During 2022,\nthe Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $ 33.3billion consisting of $ 19.8billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $ 9.9billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 3.6billion of other\ndebt. Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S.\nand non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes\nmay be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars\nincluded in total long-term debt was $ 49.8billion and $ 46.7billion. Foreign\ncurrency contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated\ndebt into U.S. dollars. The weighted-average effective interest rates for total\nlong-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and\ntotal floating-rate debt were 3.70percent, 3.55percent and 5.21percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2023, and 3.27percent, 3.23percent and 4.14percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s ALM activities maintain an\noverall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of\ninterest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\nmovements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings\nand capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the\ndebt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. The following\ntable shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of\nlong-term debt as of December 31, 2023. Included in the table are certain\nstructured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the\nborrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified\ndates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms\nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a\nreferenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may\nbe required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the\ncontractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing\nat their contractual maturity date.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America134

\n(1) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to\nmeet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the\nnotional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.\nThe distributed amounts were $ 10.3billion and $ 10.4billion at December 31, 2023\nand 2022. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s credit extension commitments at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, excluding commitments accounted for under\n\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.2billion and $ 1.6billion, which predominantly\nrelated to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of\nthese commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally\nhave specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse\nchange clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 2.6billion and $ 3.0billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022 that\nare accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these commitments of $ 67million and $ 110million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, which is classified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 23.6billion and $\n9.7billion at December 31, 2023,

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 744million and $\n575million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had commitments\nto purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $\n822million and $ 636million, which upon settlement will be included in trading\naccount assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $\n420million and $ 294million, which upon settlement will be included in trading\naccount assets. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had commitments to\nenter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of\n$ 117.0billion and $ 92.0billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 63.0billion and $ 57.8billion. A\nsignificant portion of these commitments will expire within the next 12months. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or\npurchase up to $ 4.0billion and $ 3.7billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto\nloans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through\nNovember 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior notice. At December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $\n477million and $ 571million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is\nrequired to subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve\ndistrict bank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation paid $ 5.4billion for half of its\nsubscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve\ndistrict bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products\nthat offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.8billion and $\n4.3billion. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure\nrelated to these guarantees totaled $ 577million and $ 632million, with estimated\nmaturity dates between 2033 and 2037. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain\nindemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due\nif certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification\nclauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal\ncourse of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote.\nThese agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the\nCorporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future\npayment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several\nreasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict\nfuture changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws\nwould apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in\nstandard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses.\nHistorically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The\nCorporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as\nremote.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America136                                                              \n                                                                                  \nMerchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor\nof other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that\ncannot be collected from the merchants due to, among other things, merchant fraud\nor insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be\ncollected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be\nheld liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time\nlimits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network\nrules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was\napproximately $ 395billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure as of December 31, 2023. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily\nrelates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for\nfuture delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses, and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. Exchange and Clearing\nHouse Member Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various securities and\nderivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As\na member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses\nincurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and\nunder other loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be limited\nto its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount\n(or multiple) of the Corporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in\nlimited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under\nthese membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has\nassessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage\nand Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients.\nUnder these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of\nits clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations\nin this respect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and the\naccounts of their customers, as well as by any proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their\ncustomers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements\nis difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nmaterial losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale\nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this\nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored\nmembers to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential\nfor the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration\nthe related collateral, was $ 132.5billion and $ 59.6billion at December 31, 2023\nand 2022. Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions\nsuch as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and\nother transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100percent owned\nfinance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Representations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or\nby GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-\nguaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage\nloans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies\nand certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and\nhome equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans.\nIn connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its\nsubsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and\nwarranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and\nmay continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to\notherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors,\ninvestors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties\n(collectively, repurchases). Unresolved Repurchase Claims Unresolved\nrepresentations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of\nrepurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal\nbalance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of\nfirst-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the\nexpected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage\ninsurance or mortgage guarantee payments. The notional amount of unresolved\nrepurchase claims at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 5.4billion and $ 5.5billion.\nThese balances included $ 2.2billion at both December 31, 2023 and 2022 of claims\nrelated to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where\nthe Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will\notherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.\n                                                                                  \n  137Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nDuring 2023, the Corporation received $ 254million in new repurchase claims that\nwere not time-barred. During 2023, $ 269million in claims were resolved. Reserve\nand Related Provision The reserve for representations and warranties obligations\nand corporate guarantees was $ 604million and $ 612million at December 31, 2023\nand 2022 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties\nreserve represents the Corporation\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations\nand warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to\nthe Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of\nthe reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for\nlitigation. Other Contingencies On November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) issued its final rule to impose a special assessment\nto recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) resulting from the closure\nof Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The special assessment is based on\nuninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5\nbillion. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation recorded\nnoninterest expense of $ 2.1billion in other general operating expenses for its\nestimated assessment amount. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over\neight quarterly assessment periods. The special assessment is subject to change\nfor any updates made by the FDIC to the estimated loss to the DIF, or if the\nassessments collected from insured depository institutions change due to\namendments made to their uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022\nperiod. In the event of any such change resulting in an increased assessment, the\nCorporation could recognize further expense in future periods.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many\npending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where\nthe matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or\npenalties related to each pending matter. As a matter develops, the Corporation,\nin conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether\nsuch matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for\nthe matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the\namount of the accrued\n\nliability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and\nexternal legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related\nexpense of $ 519million and $ 1.2billion was recognized in 2023 and 2022. For any\nmatter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there\nis no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated range of possible loss is $ 0to $ 0.8billion in excess of\nthe accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2023. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information\nand subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The\nestimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation\nand, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and\ntaking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below\nwill have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be material to the Corporation\u2019s business or results of operations\nfor any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.\nDeposit Insurance Assessment On January 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (District Court) alleging\nfailure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance\nassessments and interest in the amount of $ 542million for the quarters ending\nJune 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its\ncomplaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the\namount of $ 583million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31,\n2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA\u2019s alleged underreporting of\ncounterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those\nquarters, and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation\nrelated to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period\nand is defending itself against the FDIC\u2019s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA\nhas pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional\nassessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the District Court denied BANA\u2019s partial\nmotion to dismiss certain of the FDIC\u2019s claims. On April 10, 2023, the magistrate\njudge issued a report and recommendation (Report) for resolving the parties\u2019\npending summary judgment motions. The Report recommends granting the FDIC\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment on BANA\u2019s statutory liability for the unpaid assessments,\nsubject to BANA\u2019s statute of limitations defenses to assessments for the quarters\nended March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013, on which the Report\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America138                                                              \n                                                                                  \nrecommends that relevant issues should be resolved at trial. The Report also\nrecommends denying BANA\u2019s counterclaims challenging the adoption of the relevant\nassessment regulations and granting BANA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the\nFDIC\u2019s claims for unjust enrichment and disgorgement. The Report has been\nsubmitted to the District Court judge for consideration, and the parties have\nfiled objections to the recommendations in the Report. LIBOR The Corporation, BANA\nand certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most\nof the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class\nactions by persons alleging that they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR-based\nfinancial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants\nregarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims,\nincluding antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach\nof contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and\ninjunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its\naffiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York (District Court). The District Court has\ndismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of\nAmerica entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also\nsubstantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various\nother claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and\nputative class plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30,\n2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of\nthese antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class\nactions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch\nentities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a\nclass of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar\nLIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act. Unemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards BANA has been\nnamed as a defendant in a number of putative class action, mass action, and\nindividual lawsuits in multiple states related to its administration of prepaid\ndebit cards to distribute unemployment and other state benefits. These lawsuits\ngenerally assert claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Class action\nand mass action lawsuits related to the California program, the largest program\nadministered by BANA measured by total benefits and number of participants, have\nbeen consolidated into a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of California. On May 25, 2023, the court dismissed\ncertain of the claims in the MDL while allowing others to proceed, and plaintiffs\nsubsequently filed an amended complaint. BANA filed a partial motion to dismiss\ncertain of the remaining claims in the amended complaint in the MDL, which is\ncurrently pending.\n                                                                                  \n  139Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 13 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n                                                                                  \n  Declared                                                                        \n  Quarterly Cash                                                                  \n  Dividends on                                                                    \n  Common Stock(1)                                                                 \n  Declaration                                                       Dividend Per  \n  Date               Record Date         Payment Date                      Share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January 31,        March 1, 2024       March 29, 2024      $              0.24  \n  2024                                                                            \n  October 18,        December 1, 2023    December 29,                       0.24  \n  2023                                   2023                                     \n  July 19, 2023      September 1,        September 29,                      0.24  \n                     2023                2023                                     \n  April\u00a026, 2023     June 2, 2023        June 30, 2023                      0.22  \n  February\u00a01,        March 3, 2023       March 31, 2023                     0.22  \n  2023                                                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe cash dividends paid per share of\ncommon stock were $ 0.92$ 0.86and $\n0.78for 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nThe table below summarizes common stock\nrepurchases during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Common Stock Repurchase Summary                                                 \n  (in millions)                                                                   \n  Total share repurchases, including CCAR          2023        2022         2021  \n  capital plan repurchases                          147         126          615  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Purchase price of shares repurchased and     $  4,576    $  5,073    $  25,126  \n  retired(1)                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(1) Consists of repurchases pursuant to\nthe Corporation\u2019s CCAR capital plans.\nDuring 2023, in connection with employee\nstock plans, the Corporation issued\n75million shares of its common stock\nand, to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations, repurchased 30million\nshares of common stock.

The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series 1\nthrough 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together with the\ncommon stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no\ngeneral voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the\nCorporation have preference over the Corporation\u2019s common stock with respect to\nthe payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation\u2019s assets in the event\nof a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series B, F and G\nPreferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for threeor\nmore semi-annual or sixor more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether\nconsecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of\npreferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which\nequivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a\nsingle class) will be entitled to vote for the election of twoadditional\ndirectors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full\ndividends on these series for at least twosemi-annual or fourquarterly dividend\nperiods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage. The 7.25% Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does\nnot have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock\nmay be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20shares of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation\nmay cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time\nor from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-\napplicable conversion rate if, for 20trading days during any period of\n30consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130percent\nof the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a\nconversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder,\nsubsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the\nCorporation will still pay any

regulators) jointly establish regulatory capital\nadequacy rules, including Basel 3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial\nholding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by\nthe Federal Reserve. The Corporation\u2019s banking entity affiliates are subject to\ncapital adequacy rules issued by the OCC. The Corporation and its primary banking\nentity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As\nAdvanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its\n\nbanking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital\nratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The\nCorporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)\nof 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers. The Corporation\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries\nare required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA framework. The following table presents capital ratios\nand related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced\napproaches as measured at December 31, 2023 and 2022 for the Corporation and

2023 and 2022, capital ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the\nadoption of the current expected credit losses accounting standard on January 1,\n2020.\n\n(2) The common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the\nCET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge of\n2.5percent and the Corporation\u2019s capital conservation buffer of 2.5percent (under\nthe Advanced approaches) or the stress capital buffer of 2.5percent at December\n31, 2023 and 3.4percent at December 31, 2022 (under the Standardized approach), as\napplicable. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR\nregulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2023 and 2022 are\nthe minimum ratios under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of\n2.5percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends\nare the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA\nframework.\n\n(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to\nthe qualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking regulators require\ninstitutions to meet the established minimums outlined in the table above. Failure\nto meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary\nactions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s financial position. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation\nand its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized. Other Regulatory Matters\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents in\nthe amount of $ 3.6billion and $ 5.6billion, and securities with a fair value of $\n18.0billion and $ 16.6billion that were segregated in compliance with securities\nregulations. Cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance with securities\nregulations are a component of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10\n\u2013 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and\nRestricted Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had\ncash deposited with clearing organizations of $ 23.7billion and $ 20.7billion\nprimarily recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Bank\nSubsidiary Distributions The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by\nthe Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its\nbank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America California, N.A. In 2023, the\nCorporation received dividends of $ 22.2billion from BANA and $ 199million from\nBank of America California, N.A. The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank\nmay declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank\u2019s net\nprofits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two\nyears. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less\ndividends declared during the period. In 2024, BANA can declare and pay dividends\nof approximately $ 12.0billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal\nto its retained net profits for 2024 up to the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration. Bank of America California, N.A. can pay dividends of $ 66million in\n2024 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2024 up to\nthe date of any such dividend declaration.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America144                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPension and Postretirement Plans The Corporation sponsors a qualified\nnoncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of\nnoncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement health and life\nplans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the\nCorporation vary based on the country and local practices. The Qualified Pension\nPlan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-\nselected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan\nthat effectively provides principal protection for participant balances\ntransferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for\nfunding any shortfall on the guarantee feature. Benefits earned under the\nQualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts\ncontinue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the\nterms of the plan document. The Corporation has an annuity contract that\nguarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan\n(Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be\nresponsible for or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of\nthe annuity assets. The Corporation made nocontribution under this agreement in\n2023 or 2022. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and\nprovide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.\n\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible employees\nmay become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or\nlife insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as\nthe Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The Pension and Postretirement Plans\ntable summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the\nprojected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated\nbenefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to\ndetermine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The estimate of the Corporation\u2019s PBO associated with\nthese plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for\nmortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from\na cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated\ncorporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of\nthe plans. The decreases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2023 resulted\nin an increase to the PBO of $ 511million at December 31, 2023. The increases in\nthe weighted-average discount rates in 2022 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of\napproximately $ 5.3billion at December 31, 2022. Significant gains and losses\nrelated to changes in the PBO for 2023 and 2022 primarily resulted from changes in\nthe discount rate.\n

not applicable\nThe asset valuation method used to calculate the expected return on plan assets\ncomponent of net periodic benefit cost for the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes\n60percent of the prior year\u2019s market gains or losses at the next measurement date\nwith the remaining 40percent spread equally over the subsequent four years. Gains\nand losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are recognized\nin accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable\naccounting guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was\ndetermined using the \u201cprojected unit credit\u201d actuarial method. For the U.S.\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans, 50percent of the unrecognized gain or loss\nat the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a\nlevel basis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the\npostretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement\nHealth and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the\nexpected cost of benefits covered by the U.S. Postretirement Health and Life Plans\nis 6.50percent for 2024, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in 2028 and later years.\nThe Corporation\u2019s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is\nsensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the\nQualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension\nPlans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bps decline in discount\nrates and expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the\nnet periodic benefit cost for 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America146                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       9                \n         \u2014       \u2014       4       3       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \nPlan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement\nvehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits\npromised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest\nthe trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing\nbenefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The\nCorporation\u2019s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over\nthe long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts\nto maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate\nby the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and\nlaws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant\nfor establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges\nare established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and\nliability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are\nemployed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional\naspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset\nallocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment\nmeasures. The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a\nU.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are invested prudently so that\nthe benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the\nnature and the duration of the plans\u2019 liabilities. The selected asset allocation\nstrategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The\nexpected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis\nof historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations,\ncurrent market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2019 past\nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected\nreturn on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related\nvalue for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value\nfor the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The\nexpected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of\nthe performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension\nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return\nthat may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension\nPlan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in\nfixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration\nof the plan\u2019s obligations. The target allocations for 2024 by asset category for\nthe Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other\nPension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the\nQualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $\n299million ( 1.69percent of total plan assets) and $ 296million ( 1.72percent of\ntotal plan assets) at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                            \n  2024 Target Allocation                                                    \n                            Percentage                                      \n                            Qualified       Non-U.S.         Nonqualified   \n  Asset Category            Pension Plan    Pension Plans    and Other      \n                                                             Pension Plans  \n  Equity securities         15-45%          0-20%            0-5%           \n  Debt securities           40-80%          40-75%           95-100%        \n  Real estate               0-10%           0-15%            0-5%           \n  Other                     0-10%           10-40%           0-5%           \n                                                                            \nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the\nCorporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20\n\u2013 Fair Value Measurements .

The Corporation\nrecorded expense of $ 1.2billion in\n2023, 2022 and 2021 related to the\nqualified defined contribution plans. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, 178million\nand 179million shares of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock were held by\nthese plans. Payments to the plans for\ndividends on common stock were $\n166million, $ 153million and $\n139million in 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Certain non-U.S. employees\nare covered under defined contribution\npension plans that are separately\nadministered in accordance with local\nlaws. NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation\nPlans The Corporation administers a\nnumber of equity compensation plans,\nwith awards being granted predominantly\nfrom the Bank of America Corporation\nEquity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan,\n790million shares of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommon stock are authorized to be used\nfor grants of awards. During 2023 and\n2022, the Corporation granted 115million\nand 102million RSUs to certain employees\nunder the BACEP. These RSUs were\nauthorized to settle predominantly in\nshares of common stock of the\nCorporation. Certain RSUs will be\nsettled in cash or contain settlement\nprovisions that subject these awards to\nvariable accounting whereby compensation\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based\non changes in the share price of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock up to the\nsettlement date. The RSUs granted in\n2023 and 2022 predominantly vest over\nfour yearsin one-fourth increments on\neach of the first four anniversaries of\nthe grant date, provided that the\nemployee remains continuously employed\nwith the Corporation during that time,\nand will be expensed ratably over the\nvesting period, net of estimated\nforfeitures, for non-retirement eligible\nemployees based on the grant-date fair\nvalue of the shares. Of the RSUs granted\nin 2023 and 2022, 42million and\n39million do not include retirement\neligibility. For all other RSUs granted\nto employees who are retirement\neligible, they are deemed authorized as\nof the beginning of the year preceding\nthe grant date when the incentive award\nplans are generally approved. As a\nresult, the estimated value is expensed\nratably over the year preceding the\ngrant date. The compensation cost for\nthe stock-based plans was $ 3.1billion,\n$ 2.9billion and $ 3.0billion, and the\nrelated income tax benefit was $\n733million, $ 697million and $\n723million for 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. At December 31, 2023,\nthere was an estimated $ 4.0billion of\ntotal unrecognized compensation cost\nrelated to certain share-based\ncompensation awards that is expected to\nbe recognized generally over a period of\nup to four years, with a weighted-\naverage period of 2.5years.\n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock\nUnits\nThe total fair value of restricted stock\nand restricted stock units vested in\n2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2.6billion, $\n3.4billion and $ 2.3billion,\nrespectively.

The U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets are primarily net\noperating losses (NOLs), incurred by the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. broker-dealer entity\nin historical periods, which do not\nexpire under U.K. tax law and are\nassessed regularly for impairment. If\nfurther U.K. tax law changes are\nenacted, a corresponding income tax\nadjustment will be made based on the\namount of available net deferred tax\nassets and applicable tax rate changes.\nTax credits originate from investments\nin affordable housing and renewable\nenergy partnerships and similar\nentities. Significant increases in the\ntax credits recognized over the last\nthree annual periods have been primarily\ndriven by the Corporation\u2019s continued\ngrowth in the volume of investments in\nwind and solar energy production\nfacilities, consistent with the\nCorporation\u2019s commitment to support the\ntransition to a lower carbon economy.\nFor more information, see Note 6 \u2013\nSecuritizations and Other Variable\nInterest Entities .\nThe reconciliation of the beginning\nunrecognized tax benefits (UTB) balance\nto the ending balance is presented in\nthe table below.\n                                                                                  \n  Reconciliation of the Change in                                                 \n  Unrecognized Tax Benefits                                                       \n  (Dollars in millions)                             2023        2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, January 1                            $  1,056    $  1,322    $  1,340  \n  Increases related to positions taken                76         121         208  \n  during the current year                                                         \n  Increases related to positions taken               139         167         265  \n  during prior years(1)                                                           \n  Decreases related to positions taken               -32        -289        -413  \n  during prior years(1)                                                           \n  Settlements                                       -380         -99         -23  \n  Expiration of statute of limitations               -48        -166         -55  \n  Balance, December 31                          $    811    $  1,056    $  1,322  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The sum of the positions taken\nduring prior years differs from the $(\n26) million, $( 273) million and $( 155)\nmillion in the Reconciliation of Income\nTax Expense table due to temporary\nitems, state items and jurisdictional\noffsets, as well as the inclusion of\ninterest in the Reconciliation of Income\nTax Expense table.\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nbalance of the Corporation\u2019s UTBs which\nwould, if recognized, affect the\nCorporation\u2019s effective tax rate was $\n671million, $ 709million and $\n959million, respectively. Included in\nthe UTB balance are some items the\nrecognition of which would not affect\nthe effective tax rate, such as the tax\neffect of certain temporary differences,\nthe portion of gross state UTBs that\nwould be offset by the tax benefit of\nthe associated federal deduction and the\nportion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that\nwould be offset by tax reductions in\nother jurisdictions. It is reasonably\npossible that the UTB balance may\ndecrease by as much as $ 109million\nduring the next 12 months, since\nresolved items will be removed from the\nbalance whether their resolution results\nin payment or recognition.

considering the benefit of\nfederal deductions were $ 1.0billion and\n$ 597million.\nManagement concluded that novaluation\nallowance was necessary to reduce the\ndeferred tax assets related to the U.K.\nNOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and\ncertain state NOL carryforwards since\nestimated future taxable income will be\nsufficient to utilize these assets prior\nto their expiration. The majority of the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. net deferred tax\nassets, which consist primarily of NOLs,\nare expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Management\u2019s conclusion is\nsupported by financial results, profit\nforecasts for the relevant entities and\nthe indefinite period to carry forward\nNOLs. However, a material change in\nthose estimates could lead management to\nreassess such valuation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, U.S. federal\nincome taxes had not been provided on\napproximately $ 5.0billion of temporary\ndifferences associated with investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries that are\nessentially permanent in duration. If\nthe Corporation were to record the\nassociated deferred tax liability, the\namount would be approximately $\n1.0billion.\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value\nis defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\non the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity\nto maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels\nbased on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information\nregarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation\naccounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more\ninformation, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option. Valuation Techniques The following\nsections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies\nor assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. During 2023,\nthere were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had,\nor are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of trading account assets and\nliabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based\non either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt\nsecurities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for\nsimilar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair\nvalues of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price\nquotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a\nmarket sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of\nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates\nthe fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and\nprepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2019s best estimate of current key\nassumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal\nand interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for\nsimilar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other\ninstruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value\nof the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing\nservices, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings.\nSituations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of\ncredit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In\nthese instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market\ninformation and other factors,\n                                                                                  \n  151Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nprincipally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements and changes in credit\nratings made by one or more rating agencies. Derivative Assets and Liabilities The\nfair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are\ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including\ninterest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves\nand volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are\nactively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers,\nmarket transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing\nservices are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation.\nEstimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are\neither option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs\nare less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based\nextrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair\nvalues. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments\nfor market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific\nfactors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its\nfair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the\ncredit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by\ncounterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty\ncredit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the\nCorporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its\nfair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives\nand derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it\nreceives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of\nfair value, primarily based on market data. Loans and Loan Commitments The fair\nvalues of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available,\nor discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable\ndebt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable\nborrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as\nappropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of\nthe borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are primarily\ndetermined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of\nprojecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and\ndiscounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. Loans Held-for-\nsale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available,\nor are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates\napproximating the Corporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans\nadjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is\nembedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan\nperformance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms\nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices,\ncurrencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are\nestimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions\nof the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances,\nunobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option\nvolatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these\ninputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in\ndetermining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread\nis determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\nSecurities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase\nagreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are\ndetermined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that\nrequire the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to\ngenerate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority\nof market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nDeposits The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models,\nincluding discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market\ninputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or\npricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively\nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the\nimpact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit\nrisk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash\nmarket. Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair values of asset-backed secured\nfinancings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined\nby discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the\nCorporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans, adjusted to reflect the\ninherent credit risk.\n

The following is a reconciliation to the line\nitems in the table on page 154: Trading account assets \u2013 Corporate securities,\ntrading loans and other of $ 2.4billion, Trading account assets \u2013 Non-U.S.\nsovereign debt of $ 518million, Trading account assets \u2013 Mortgage trading loans,\nMBS and ABS of $ 1.6billion, AFS debt securities of $ 504million, Other debt\nsecurities carried at fair value - Non-agency residential of $ 119million, Other\nassets, including MSRs, of $ 1.8billion, Loans and leases of $ 253million and LHFS\nof $ 232million.\n\n(3) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes.\n\n(4) Includes models such as Monte Carlo simulation, Black-Scholes and other\nmethods that model the joint dynamics of interest, inflation and foreign exchange\nrates.\n\n(5) The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest,\nprepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions.\n\nCPR = Constant Prepayment Rate\n\nCDR = Constant Default Rate\n\nMMBtu = Million British thermal units\n\nIR = Interest Rate\n\nFX = Foreign Exchange\n\nn/a = not applicable\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America158                                                              \n                                                                                  \nIn the previous tables, instruments\nbacked by residential and commercial\nreal estate assets include RMBS,\ncommercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage\nCDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities\nand other include corporate CLOs and\nCDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and\nsecurities backed by non-real estate\nassets. Structured liabilities primarily\ninclude equity-linked notes that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. The Corporation uses multiple\nmarket approaches in valuing certain of\nits Level 3 financial instruments. For\nexample, market comparables and\ndiscounted cash flows are used together.\nFor a given product, such as corporate\ndebt securities, market comparables may\nbe used to estimate some of the\nunobservable inputs, and then these\ninputs are incorporated into a\ndiscounted cash flow model. Therefore,\nthe balances disclosed encompass both of\nthese techniques. The levels of\naggregation and diversity within the\nproducts disclosed in the tables result\nin certain ranges of inputs being wide\nand unevenly distributed across asset\nand liability categories. Uncertainty of\nFair Value Measurements from\nUnobservable Inputs Loans and Securities\nA significant increase in market yields,\ndefault rates, loss severities or\nduration would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value for long\npositions. Short positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. The impact of changes in\nprepayment speeds would have resulted in\ndiffering impacts depending on the\nseniority of the instrument and, in the\ncase of CLOs, whether prepayments can be\nreinvested. A significant increase in\nprice would have resulted in a\nsignificantly higher fair value for long\npositions, and short positions would\nhave been impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. Structured Liabilities and\nDerivatives For credit derivatives, a\nsignificant increase in market yield,\nupfront points (i.e., a single upfront\npayment made by a\n\nprotection buyer at inception), credit\nspreads, default rates or loss\nseverities would have resulted in a\nsignificantly lower fair value for\nprotection sellers and higher fair value\nfor protection buyers. The impact of\nchanges in prepayment speeds would have\nresulted in differing impacts depending\non the seniority of the instrument.\nStructured credit derivatives are\nimpacted by credit correlation. Default\ncorrelation is a parameter that\ndescribes the degree of dependence among\ncredit default rates within a credit\nportfolio that underlies a credit\nderivative instrument. The sensitivity\nof this input on the fair value varies\ndepending on the level of subordination\nof the tranche. For senior tranches that\nare net purchases of protection, a\nsignificant increase in default\ncorrelation would have resulted in a\nsignificantly higher fair value. Net\nshort protection positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally\nopposite way. For equity derivatives,\ncommodity derivatives, interest rate\nderivatives and structured liabilities,\na significant change in long-dated rates\nand volatilities and correlation inputs\n(i.e., the degree of correlation between\nan equity security and an index, between\ntwo different commodities, between two\ndifferent interest rates, or between\ninterest rates and foreign exchange\nrates) would have resulted in a\nsignificant impact to the fair value;\nhowever, the magnitude and direction of\nthe impact depend on whether the\nCorporation is long or short the\nexposure. For structured liabilities, a\nsignificant increase in yield or\ndecrease in price would have resulted in\na significantly lower fair value.\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation\nholds certain assets that are measured\nat fair value only in certain situations\n(e.g., the impairment of an asset), and\nthese measurements are referred to\nherein as nonrecurring.

and Loan Commitments The Corporation elects to account for certain loans and\nloan commitments that exceed the Corporation\u2019s single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments are\nactively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships\nmay be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation\u2019s\npublic side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of\nthe hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for\ndesignation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair value\noption allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair\nvalue, which is more consistent with management\u2019s view of the underlying economics\nand the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option\nallows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise\nresult from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage\nLHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option. These loans are actively\nmanaged and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may\nbe mitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to\ndesignate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are\ncarried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset\nby changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from\nthe asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of\ncost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not\nelected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily\nbecause these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative\ninstruments.\n\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets The Corporation elects to account for\ncertain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a\nfair value basis under the fair value option. Other Assets The Corporation elects\nto account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with\nderivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows\nthe Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at fair value. Securities Financing Agreements\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements,\nincluding resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These\nelections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and its\nagencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.\nLong-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-\nrate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to\nreduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the\nderivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-\nterm deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. Short-\nterm Borrowings The Corporation elects to account for certain short-term\nborrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value\noption because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America160                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-backed secured\nfinancings, which are also classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair\nvalue option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created\nby accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the\ncorresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. Long-term\nDebt The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily\nstructured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is either\nrisk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.

fair value option at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and\nliabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in

Certain loans,\ndeposits, long-term debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial\ninstruments are accounted for under the fair value option. For more information,\nsee Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option . The following disclosures include financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending\nbalance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nShort-term Financial Instruments The carrying value of short-term financial\ninstruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and\nother short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements and short-term borrowings, approximates the fair value of\nthese instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to\nlimited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities\nand carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation accounts for\ncertain resale and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America162                                                              \n                                                                                  \nUnder the fair value hierarchy, cash and\ncash equivalents are classified as Level\n1.

ALM activities encompass interest\nrate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all\nof the results are allocated to the business segments. Basis of Presentation The\nmanagement accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results\nby utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income\nderived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an\nactivity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and\nassumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the\nbusiness. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on\nan FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an\nFTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment\nresults also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies\n                                                                                  \n  163Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nthat are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the\nbusinesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches\nassets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity\ncharacteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds\nassets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates\nassets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also\nincludes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities. The Corporation\u2019s ALM activities include an overall\ninterest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various\nderivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital\nthat are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage\ninterest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly\nadversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of the\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate\nbased on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external\nproduct pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the\nCorporation\u2019s internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other\nALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business\nsegment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain centralized or shared\nfunctions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. The table\nbelow presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with net interest\nincome on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total\nCorporation) for 2023, 2022 and 2021, and total assets at December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021 for each business segment, as well as All Other.\n                                                                                  \n

The non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa and in Asia.
