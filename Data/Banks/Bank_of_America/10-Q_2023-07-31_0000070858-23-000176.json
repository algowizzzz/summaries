While the timing and\namount of any expense recognition are\nunknown until the proposed rule is\nfinalized, if the final rule is issued\nas proposed, the estimated impact of the\nspecial assessment on the Corporation\nwould be a noninterest expense of\napproximately $1.9 billion that would be\nrecognized upon finalization of the\nrule.

The Corporation will continue to\nmonitor developments related to ongoing\nbenchmark reform and the transition to\nalternative reference rates (ARRs) for\nexpected impact on the Corporation and\nfinancial markets more broadly.\n\nIn connection with LIBOR Cessation, the\nCorporation has substantially completed\nthe transition process for its products\nand contracts referencing USD LIBOR to\nARRs, subject to certain remaining\nnotional contractual exposures not\nsignificant to the Corporation. For the\ninsignificant amount of products and\ncontracts that have temporarily\ntransitioned to synthetic USD LIBOR, the\nCorporation expects to transition these\nexposures to ARRs consistent with the\ntemporary nature of synthetic USD LIBOR.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with LIBOR\nCessation, certain central\ncounterparties completed processes to\nconvert outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared\nderivatives to ARR positions. In March\n2023 and June 2023, the Corporation made\nannouncements regarding the transition\npaths away from either USD LIBOR or the\nUSD LIBOR ICE Swap Rate, as applicable,\nfor certain outstanding securities\nissued by the Corporation, BofA\n\nFinance LLC and certain other affiliated\nissuers. For more information on those\nannouncements, see the Corporation\u2019s\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K filed with\nthe SEC on March 31, 2023 and June 26,\n2023.\n\nAs previously disclosed, as a result of\nthe transition of Interbank Offered\nRate-based products and contracts to\nvarious ARRs, including the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR), the\nCorporation has begun using ARRs in its\nbaseline forecast of net interest\nincome.

For the same periods in the\nprior year, the provision for credit\nlosses was primarily driven by loan\ngrowth and a dampened macroeconomic\noutlook, partially offset by asset\nquality improvement and reduced COVID-19\npandemic uncertainties.

 \nIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\n\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 8.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 48.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile against our risk appetite\nand risk capacity. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A.

Additionally,\nthe Board authorized common stock\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder the Corporation\u2019s equity-based\ncompensation plans. Pursuant to the\nBoard\u2019s authorizations, during the\nsecond quarter of 2023, we repurchased\n$550 million of common stock,\npredominantly offsetting shares awarded\nunder equity-based compensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a bank holding company, we are\nsubject to regulatory capital rules,\nincluding Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The Corporation's\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated banking\nentity, BANA, are Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under\n\nStandardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements is used to\nassess capital adequacy, including under\nthe PCA framework. As of June 30, 2023,\nthe CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\nTotal capital ratios under the\nStandardized approach were the binding\nratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nG-SIB surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements are 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nand 9.5 percent under the Advanced\napproaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase 50 bps on\nJanuary 1, 2024, which would increase\nour minimum CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement. At June 30, 2023, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.6\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its current CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement as well as the minimum\nrequirement expected to be in place as\nof January 1, 2024 due to the\nanticipated increase in our G-SIB\nsurcharge.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022.

The SLR\nregulatory minimum includes a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt June 30, 2023, CET1 capital was\n$190.1 billion, an increase of $10.1\nbillion from December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by dividends and common stock\nrepurchases. Tier 1 capital increased\n$10.1 billion primarily driven by the\nsame factors as CET1 capital. Total\ncapital under the Standardized approach\nincreased $9.3 billion primarily due to\nthe same factors driving the increase in\nTier 1 capital and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital, partially\noffset by a decrease in subordinated\n\ndebt. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at June 30, 2023,\nincreased $34.2 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 to $1,639\nbillion primarily due to higher\ncounterparty exposures in Global Markets\nand loan growth. Supplementary leverage\nexposure at June 30, 2023 increased\n$118.2 billion primarily due to higher\ncash held at central banks, partially\noffset by lower debt securities\nbalances.\n

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc.

The Corporation's\nprincipal European broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are Merrill Lynch\nInternational (MLI) and BofA Securities\nEurope SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its minimum capital\nrequirements as an alternative net\ncapital broker-dealer under Rule\n15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute\ntheir minimum capital requirements in\naccordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are\nalso registered as futures commission\nmerchants and are subject to Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nRegulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also registered with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At June\n30, 2023, BofAS had tentative net\ncapital of $22.0 billion. BofAS also had\nregulatory net capital of $19.8 billion,\nwhich exceeded the minimum requirement\nof $4.5 billion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary\nof BofAS and provides clearing and\nsettlement services as well as prime\nbrokerage and arranged financing\nservices for institutional clients.

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nstress from increased volatility due to\nthe failure of certain financial\ninstitutions in the first half of 2023.\nOur practices have also allowed us to\neffectively manage market fluctuations\nfrom the rising interest rate\nenvironment, inflationary pressures and\nchanges in the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions.

NB Holdings\nCorporation Bank of America Corporation,\nas the parent company (the Parent),\nwhich is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, has an intercompany\narrangement with our wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary, NB Holdings\nCorporation (NB Holdings). We have\ntransferred, and agreed to transfer,\nadditional Parent assets not required to\nsatisfy anticipated near-term\nexpenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent\nis expected to continue to have access\nto the same flow of dividends, interest\nand other amounts of cash necessary to\nservice its debt, pay dividends and\nperform other obligations as it would\nhave had it not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets.\nThese arrangements support our preferred\nsingle point of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the Parent\nwould be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity\nSources and Other Unencumbered Assets We\nmaintain liquidity available to the\nCorporation, including the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, in the form of\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of assets\nthat are readily available to the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, including\nholding company, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash is primarily\non deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent, central banks\noutside of the U.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and other investment-grade\nsecurities, and a select group of\nnon-U.S. government securities.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand\n\nsecurities to certain Federal Home Loan\nBanks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window. The cash we could have\nobtained by borrowing against this pool\nof specifically-identified eligible\nassets was $331 billion and $348 billion\nat June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nWe have established operational\nprocedures to enable us to borrow\nagainst these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 14 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n                    Average Global            Three Months                        \n  Table 14          Liquidity                        Ended                        \n  (Dollars in       Sources                        June 30           December 31  \n  billions)         Composition                       2023                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                              $               355    $              174  \n  deposit                                                                         \n  U.S. Treasury                                        134                   252  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-back\u2026                                                                  \n  securities,                                          364                   427  \n  and other                                                                       \n  investment-gr\u2026                                                                  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                            14                    15  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               867    $              868  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR) rules.

Our net charge-off\nratio increased primarily driven by\ncredit card loans, as delinquency trends\ncontinue to slowly increase off of\nhistoric lows; however, they remain\nbelow pre-pandemic levels. Nonperforming\nloans increased modestly compared to\nDecember 31, 2022 driven by the\ncommercial real estate office property\ntype, while commercial reservable\ncriticized exposure increased driven by\nboth office as well as other industries\nthat have been impacted by the current\nenvironment.

Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting\n\ncredit limits, and establishing\noperating processes and metrics to\nquantify and balance risks and returns.\nStatistical models are built using\ndetailed behavioral information from\nexternal sources, such as credit\nbureaus, and/or internal historical\nexperience and are a component of our\nconsumer credit risk management process.\nThese models are used in part to assist\nin making both new and ongoing credit\ndecisions as well as portfolio\nmanagement strategies, including\nauthorizations and line management,\ncollection practices and strategies, and\ndetermination of the allowance for loan\nand lease losses and allocated capital\nfor credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2023, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable and home\nprices have shown signs of stabilization\nin recent months.

mortgage portfolio\ndecreased $27 million during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 primarily due\nto returns to performing and paydowns\noutpacing new additions. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat June 30, 2023, $1.4 billion, or 64\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more increased $54 million.\n\nNet charge-offs of $2 million and $3\nmillion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 decreased $84\nmillion and $73 million compared to the\nsame periods in 2022, primarily due to\nloan sales that occurred in the second\nquarter of 2022.\n\nOf the $217.7 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat June 30, 2023, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period was $3.5\nbillion, or six percent, at June 30,\n2023. Residential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization period\ngenerally experience a higher rate of\nearly stage\n\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2023,\n$74 million, or two percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $898\nmillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at June 30,\n2023, $184 million, or five percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered the\namortization period were nonperforming,\nof which $63 million were contractually\ncurrent. Loans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-collateralized loans to\nour wealth management clients and have\nan interest-only period of 3 to 10\nyears. Approximately 97 percent of these\nloans that have yet to enter the\namortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until\n2025 or later.\n                                                                                  \n  31Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio.

Of the nonperforming home\nequity loans at June 30, 2023, $266\nmillion, or 55 percent, were current on\ncontractual payments. In addition, $135\nmillion, or 28 percent, were 180 days or\nmore past due and had been written down\nto the estimated fair value of the\ncollateral, less costs to sell. Accruing\nloans that were 30 days or more past due\ndecreased $3 million during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2023 net recoveries decreased $8 million\nto $16 million compared to the same\nperiod in 2022.

The\nHELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At June 30, 2023, $49 million,\nor one percent, of outstanding HELOCs\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere accruing past due 30 days or more.\nIn addition, at June 30, 2023, $318\nmillion, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America32                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod.

During the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023,\ncommercial credit quality deteriorated\nas nonperforming commercial loans and\nreservable criticized utilized exposure\nincreased primarily driven by the\ncommercial real estate office property\ntype; however, the commercial net\ncharge-off ratio of 0.10 percent for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 remained\nlow.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2022; however, we are\nclosely monitoring borrower performance\nin the increased rate environment and\nemerging trends. Many commercial real\nestate markets are still experiencing\ndisruptions in demand, supply chain\nchallenges, tenant difficulties and\nchallenging capital markets. Recent\ndemand for office space has been\nstagnant, and future demand for office\nspace continues to be uncertain as\ncompanies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $245 million\nduring the six months ended June 30,\n2023 to $5.2 billion, primarily driven\nby certain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 41.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $157 million during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023 to\n$705.0 billion primarily driven by\nhigher loans and leases. The utilization\nrate for loans and leases, standby\nletters of credit (SBLCs) and financial\nguarantees, and commercial letters of\ncredit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent\nat both June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.\n\nTable 26 presents commercial credit\nexposure by type for utilized, unfunded\nand total binding committed credit\nexposure.

PPP\nloans decreased $464 million during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 primarily\ndue to repayment of the loans by the\nSmall Business Administration (SBA)\nunder the terms of the program.\nExcluding PPP, credit card-related\nproducts were 55 percent and 53 percent\nof the U.S. small business commercial\nportfolio at June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022 and represented 98 percent of\nthe net charge-offs for both the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023\ncompared to 100 percent for both the\nthree and six months ended June 30,\n2022. The decrease of $154 million in\naccruing past due 90 days or more for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023 was\ndriven by PPP loans, which are fully\nguaranteed by the SBA.\n\nNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases\nand Foreclosed Properties Activity\n\nTable 31 presents the nonperforming\ncommercial loans, leases and foreclosed\nproperties activity during the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNonperforming loans do not include loans\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. During the six months ended June\n30, 2023, nonperforming commercial loans\nand leases increased $343 million to\n$1.4 billion. At June 30, 2023, 98\npercent of commercial nonperforming\nloans, leases and foreclosed properties\nwere secured, and 58 percent were\ncontractually current. Commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at 86\npercent of their unpaid principal\nbalance, as the carrying value of these\nloans has been reduced to the estimated\ncollateral value less costs to

Total commercial committed\nexposure increased $10.3 billion during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023 to\n$1.2 trillion. The increase in\ncommercial committed exposure was\nconcentrated in Capital goods, Finance\ncompanies and Asset manager & funds.\n\nFor information on industry limits, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations in\nthe MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $168.1 billion, increased\n$3.0 billion during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry\nconcentration with committed exposure of\n$101.3 billion, increased $1.6 billion,\nor two percent, during the six months\nended June 30, 2023. For more\ninformation on the commercial real\nestate and related portfolios, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Commercial Real Estate on\npage 37.\n\nCapital goods, our third largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $92.9 billion, increased\n$5.6 billion, or six percent, during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023. The\nincrease in committed exposure occurred\nprimarily as a result of increases in\nMachinery and Trading companies and\ndistributors, partially offset by a\ndecrease in Industrial Conglomerates.\n\nThere is uncertainty in the U.S. and\nglobal economies due to various\nmacroeconomic challenges including\ngeopolitical, inflationary pressures and\nelevated interest rates, and a number of\nindustries will likely continue to be\nadversely impacted due to these\nconditions.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in\nour credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $9.2 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $34 million and $111\nmillion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to net gains of\n$131 million and $122 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.\nThe gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses\non the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are\nincluded in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 38. For more\ninformation, see Trading Risk Management on page 43.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal\n\ncourse of business through credit,\nmarket and operational risk governance\nrather than through country risk\ngovernance.

$57.1 billion,\nwhich represents an increase of $1.7\nbillion from December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily driven by higher\nexposure with financial institutions and\nthe central bank, partially offset\n\nby reduced corporate exposure. Our\nsecond largest non-U.S. country exposure\nwas Germany with net exposure of $33.2\nbillion at June 30, 2023, a decrease of\n$12.5 billion from December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by\nlower deposits with the central bank.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America40                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses\nincreased $116 million from December 31,\n2022 to $14.3 billion at June 30, 2023,\nwhich included a $505 million reserve\nincrease related to the consumer\nportfolio and a $389 million reserve\ndecrease related to the commercial\nportfolio. The increase in the allowance\nreflected a reserve build in our\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\ncredit card loan growth, partially\noffset by a reserve release in our\ncommercial portfolio primarily driven by\ncertain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. The allowance also includes\nthe\n\nimpact of the accounting change to\nremove the recognition and measurement\nguidance on troubled debt\nrestructurings, which reduced the\nallowance for credit losses by $243\nmillion on January 1, 2023.

and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 were $869\nmillion and $1.7 billion compared to\n$571 million and $963 million for the\nsame periods in 2022 primarily due to\nlate-stage delinquent credit card loans\nthat were charged off. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $602 million to\n$1.1 billion and $1.5 billion to $2.1\nbillion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the same\nperiods in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the current-year\nperiods was driven by our consumer\nportfolio primarily due to credit card\nloan growth and asset quality, partially\noffset by certain improved macroeconomic\nconditions that primarily benefited our\ncommercial portfolio. For the same\nperiods in the prior year, the provision\nfor credit losses was primarily driven\nby loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset\nby asset quality improvement and reduced\nCOVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. In\naddition, the six-month period in the\nprior year was also driven by a reserve\nbuild related to Russian exposure. The\nprovision for credit losses for the\nconsumer\n\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, increased $690 million to\n$1.1 billion and $1.6 billion to $2.0\nbillion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the same\nperiods in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the commercial\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, increased $46 million to\n$159 million and decreased $121 million\nto $10 million for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 compared to\nthe same periods in 2022.\n\nTable 37 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\nthe three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 and 2022.

Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 38 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and\n\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio\nand the fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 38 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 38 presents period-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023, March\n31, 2023 and June 30, 2022 using a 99\npercent confidence level as well as\naverage daily trading VaR for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The\namounts disclosed in Table 38 and Table\n39 align to the view of covered\npositions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and\ncommodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, regardless\nof trading or banking treatment for the\ntrade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe average of total covered positions\nand less liquid trading positions\nportfolio VaR for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023 compared to the prior\nquarter decreased primarily due to the\nroll off of March 2020 market volatility\nfrom the window of historical data used\nin the calibration of the VaR model.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading\ndays than the high and low for the components.

Table 41 shows the\npretax impact to forecasted net interest\nincome over the next 12 months from June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 resulting\nfrom instantaneous parallel and non-\nparallel shocks to the market-based\nforward curve. Periodically, we evaluate\nthe scenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment.\n\nThe interest rate scenarios also assume\nU.S. dollar interest rates are floored\nat zero. During the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, the overall decrease in\nasset sensitivity of our balance sheet\nto higher and lower rate scenarios was\nprimarily due to changes in deposit\nproduct mix and risk management\nactivities performed in our ALM\nportfolio to respond to changing market\nconditions. We continue to be asset\nsensitive to a parallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the majority of that\nimpact coming from the short end of the\nyield curve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates negatively impact the\nfair value of our debt securities\nclassified as available for sale and\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and\n                                                                                  \n  45Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ninterest rate and foreign exchange\nderivatives in managing interest rate\nsensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in alternate\ninterest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 41 assumes no change\nin deposit portfolio size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios,\nthe increase in net interest income\nwould be impacted by any customer\nactivity resulting in the replacement of\nlow-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits\nwith higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding as our benefit in those\nscenarios would be reduced. Conversely,\nin lower-rate scenarios, any customer\nactivity that results in the replacement\nof higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits would\nreduce our exposure in those scenarios.\n\nFor interest rate scenarios larger than\n100 bps shifts, it is expected that the\ninterest rate sensitivity will\nillustrate non-linear behaviors as there\nare numerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing\nwill have non-linear impacts to larger\nshort-end rate movements. In decreasing\ninterest rate scenarios, and\nparticularly where interest rates have\ndecreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced\nas customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit\npricing will likely increase at a faster\nrate, leading to incremental interest\nexpense and reducing asset sensitivity.\nWhile the impact related to the above\nassumptions used in the asset\nsensitivity analysis can provide\ndirectional analysis on how net interest\nincome will be impacted in changing\nenvironments, the ultimate impact is\ndependent upon the interrelationship of\nthe assumptions and factors, which vary\nin different macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking\n\nBook section and are included in the\nsensitivities presented in Table 41. The\nCorporation also uses foreign currency\nderivatives in accounting hedges to\nmanage substantially all of the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations.\nBy hedging the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in\nthis area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on\nIRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThere were no significant gains or\nlosses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the hedge portfolio,\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2023 and 2022. For more information\non MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the physical impacts of climate\nchange, driven by extreme weather events\nsuch as hurricanes and floods, as well\nas chronic longer-term shifts such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels, and (2) risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\nThese changes and events may have broad\nimpacts on operations, supply chains,\ndistribution networks, customers and\nmarkets and are otherwise referred to,\nrespectively, as physical risk and\ntransition risk. These risks may impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. Physical climate events may lead\nto increased credit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or\ncollateral value, or increased\noperational risk by impacting the\nCorporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\ncustomers or vendors. Climate-related\ntransition changes in policy, technology\nor the market may amplify credit risk\nthrough financial impacts to the\nCorporation or its customers or\ncounterparties or increase market risk,\nincluding through sudden price\nadjustments. In addition, reputational\nrisk may arise, including\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \nfrom our climate-related practices,\ndisclosures and commitments. As climate\nrisk spans all key risk types, we have\ndeveloped and continue to enhance\nprocesses to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into our Risk Framework\nand risk management programs established\nfor each of our seven key types of risk.\nWe publicly announced our commitment to\nachieve net zero emissions in our\nfinancing activities, operations, and\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal). In connection with our Net Zero\nGoal, we set certain 2030 targets,\nincluding reducing emissions associated\nwith our operations and financing\nactivities, related to auto\nmanufacturing, energy and power\ngeneration, and for our supply chain,\nincluding that a certain proportion of\nour global suppliers set their own\nclimate targets (2030 Targets). We\ndisclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed\nemission and emission intensity metrics\nfor the above referenced sectors in our\n2022 Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) Report,\nwith 2019 serving as the baseline for\nour financed emissions targets. We plan\nto disclose the financed emissions for\nadditional portions of our business loan\nportfolio in 2023, and we plan to set\nfinancing activity emission reduction\ntargets for other key sectors by April\n2024. Achieving our climate-related\ngoals and targets, including our Net\nZero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require\ntechnological advances, clearly defined\nroadmaps for industry sectors, new\nstandards and public policies, including\nthose that improve the cost of capital\nfor the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy and better emissions data\nreporting, as well as ongoing, strong\nand active engagement with customers,\nsuppliers, investors, government\nofficials and other stakeholders. Given\nthe extended period of these and other\nclimate-related goals we have\nestablished, our initiatives have not\nresulted in a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\nposition in the relevant periods\npresented herein.

In\nperforming that test, we compared the\nfair value of each reporting unit to its\ncarrying value as measured by allocated\nequity. We estimated the fair value of\neach reporting unit based on the income\napproach (which utilizes the present\nvalue of cash flows to estimate fair\nvalue) and the market multiplier\napproach (which utilizes observable\nmarket prices and metrics of peer\ncompanies to estimate fair value). Our\ndiscounted cash flows were generally\nbased on the Corporation\u2019s three-year\ninternal forecasts along with long-term\nterminal growth values. Our estimated\ncash flows take into account the current\nglobal industry and market conditions\nrelated to the inflationary and interest\nrate environment. The cash flows were\ndiscounted using rates that range from\n9.75 percent to 11.25 percent, which\nwere derived from a capital asset\npricing model that incorporates the risk\nand uncertainty in the cash flow\nforecasts, the financial markets and\nindustries similar to each of the\nreporting units.\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nUnder the market multiplier approach, we\nestimated the fair value of the\nindividual reporting units utilizing\nvarious market multiples, primarily\nvarious pricing multiples, from\ncomparable publicly-traded companies in\nindustries similar to the reporting unit\nand then factored in a control premium\nbased upon observed comparable premiums\npaid for change-in-control transactions\nfor financial institutions.\n\nBased on the results of the test, we\ndetermined that each reporting unit\u2019s\nestimated fair value exceeded its\nrespective carrying value and that the\ngoodwill assigned to each reporting\nunit, as of June 30, 2023, was not\nimpaired. The fair values of the\nreporting units as a percentage of their\ncarrying values ranged from 120 percent\nto 266 percent.\n

      \nNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such that the\nresults of any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current-\nperiod presentation. New Accounting\nStandard Issued Investments \u2013 Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures The FASB\nupdated its guidance on the accounting\nfor tax credit investments, which\npermits entities to make an accounting\n\npolicy election to apply the\nproportional amortization method when\ncertain conditions are met. The new\naccounting guidance is effective on a\nretrospective or modified retrospective\nbasis beginning on January 1, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted. If adopted,\nthe Corporation does not expect the\nguidance to have a material impact on\nits consolidated financial position or\nresults of operations. New Accounting\nStandard Adopted Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses On January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting\nand disclosure requirements for expected\ncredit losses (ECL) that removed the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and\nadded disclosures on the financial\neffect and subsequent performance of\ncertain types of modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Upon adoption of the\nstandard, the Corporation recorded a\nreduction of $ 243million in the\nallowance for credit losses for the\nimpact of changes in the methodology\nused to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses for non-collateral\ndependent consumer and commercial TDRs.\nThere was no impact to the valuation of\nloans previously classified as\ncollateral-dependent TDRs. After\nadjusting for deferred taxes, the\nCorporation recorded an increase of $\n184million in retained earnings through\na cumulative-effect adjustment. The\nadditional disclosures are included in\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses on a\nprospective basis and include loan\nmodifications where the contractual\npayment terms of the borrower\u2019s loan\nagreement were modified through a\nrefinancing or restructuring.\nModifications that do not impact the\ncontractual payment terms, such as\ncovenant waivers, insignificant payment\ndeferrals, and any modifications made to\nloans carried at fair value, loans held-\nfor-sale (LHFS) and leases are not\nincluded in the disclosures. The\nCorporation uses various indicators to\nidentify borrowers in financial\ndifficulty. Consumer loan borrowers that\nare delinquent and commercial loan\nborrowers that are rated substandard or\nworse are the primary criteria used to\nidentify borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. If a borrower is\ncurrent at the time of modification, the\nloan generally remains a performing loan\nas long as there is demonstrated\nperformance prior to the modification,\nand payment in full under the modified\nterms is expected. Otherwise, the loan\nis placed on nonaccrual status and\nreported as nonperforming, excluding\nfully-insured consumer real estate\nloans, until there is sustained\nrepayment performance for a reasonable\nperiod. The allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for modified loans is determined\nin a manner consistent with the\nmethodology for the respective class and\ncredit rating of the financing\nreceivable as described in Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  53Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 and 2022.

These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to\nprimarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For\nopen cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is approximately seven years. For terminated cash flow\nhedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized\nin interest income is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond\nthis

These gains (losses) are largely offset by the\nincome or expense recorded on the hedged item.\n                                                                                  \n  Gains and                                                                       \n  Losses on                                                                       \n  Other Risk                                                                      \n  Management                                                                      \n  Derivatives          Three Months                      Six Months               \n  (Dollars in         Ended June 30                   Ended June 30               \n  millions)                    2023        2022                2023         2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest                                                                        \n  rate risk on                                                                    \n  mortgage        $             -23    $   -110    $              3    $    -257  \n  activities(\u2026                                                                    \n  2)                                                                              \n  Credit risk                   -12          16                 -40           13  \n  on loans(2)                                                                     \n  Interest                                                                        \n  rate and                                                                        \n  foreign                                                                         \n  currency                                                                        \n  risk                          781       4,303                 659        5,613  \n  on asset and                                                                    \n  liability                                                                       \n  management                                                                      \n  activities(\u2026                                                                    \n  Price risk                                                                      \n  on certain                    188        -756                 383       -1,091  \n  compensation                                                                    \n  plans(4)                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n(1) Includes hedges of interest rate risk on mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) to originate mortgage loans that will be\nheld for sale.\n\n(2) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in other income.\n\n(3) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in market making and similar\nactivities.\n\n(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in compensation and benefits\nexpense.\nTransfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives The\nCorporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial\nassets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic\nexposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives\n(e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control\nover the assets transferred. At both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 4.8billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure\nto the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.9billion at the\ntransfer dates. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the\ntransferred securities was $ 4.8billion and $ 4.7billion. Sales and Trading\nRevenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and\nliabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to include these derivative\ninstruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed\non a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global Markets business segment.\nFor more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The following table, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash\ninstruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items\nattributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets ,\ncategorized by primary risk, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and\n2022.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned.\n                                                                                  \n  61Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit-related Contingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain credit\nrisk-related contingent features,\nprimarily in the form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and credit support\ndocumentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n101.1billion and $ 101.3billion and\nposted cash and securities collateral of\n$ 88.3billion and $ 81.2billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends\non the contract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. At June 30, 2023, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the\nterms of the contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain subsidiaries\ncould be required to post to\ncounterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.8billion,\nincluding $ 2.3billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National Association (BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able\nto unilaterally terminate certain\ncontracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take\nother action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee. At\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nliability recorded for these derivative\ncontracts was not significant. The\nfollowing table presents the amount of\nadditional collateral that would have\nbeen contractually required by\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements at June 30, 2023 if the\nrating agencies had downgraded their\nlong-term senior debt ratings for the\nCorporation or certain subsidiaries by\none incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at June\n30, 2023.\n

Alternatively, the Corporation may\noffer the borrower a payment plan, which\nallows the borrower to repay past due\namounts through payments over a defined\nperiod. At June 30, 2023, the amortized\ncost of residential mortgage loans that\nwere modified through these plans during\nthe three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 was $ 276million and $ 348million.\nThe amortized cost of home equity loans\nthat were modified through these plans\nduring the same periods was $ 41million\nand $ 53million. The weighted-average\nduration of residential mortgage loan\nmodifications was approximately 6months\nand 8months for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023. For the same\nperiods, the weighted-average duration\nfor home equity loan modifications was\napproximately 6months and 9months. The\ntotal forborne payments for residential\nmortgage loan modifications was $\n9million and $ 15million for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023. For\nthe same periods, the total forborne\npayments for home equity modifications\nwas $ 3million and $ 5million. If a\nborrower is unable to fulfill their\nobligations under the forbearance plans,\nthey may be offered a trial or permanent\nmodification. Trial Modifications :\nTrial modification plans generally\nconsist of the Corporation offering a\nborrower modified loan terms that reduce\ntheir contractual payments temporarily\nover a three-to- four-monthtrial period.\nIf the customer successfully makes the\nmodified payments during the trial\nperiod and formally accepts the modified\nterms, the modified loan terms become\npermanent. At June 30, 2023, the\namortized cost of residential mortgage\nloans entering trial modifications\nduring the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 was $ 27million and $\n49million. The amortized cost of home\nequity loans entering trial\nmodifications during the same periods\nwas $ 14million and $ 22million.\n\nPermanent Modifications : Permanent\nmodifications include borrowers that\nhave completed a trial modification and\nhave had their contractual payment terms\npermanently modified, as well as\nborrowers that proceed directly to a\npermanent modification without a trial\nperiod. In a permanent modification, the\nborrower\u2019s payment terms are typically\nmodified in more than one manner but\ngenerally include a term extension and\nan interest rate reduction. At times,\nthe permanent modification may also\ninclude principal forgiveness and/or a\ndeferral of past due principal and\ninterest amounts to the end of the loan\nterm. The combinations utilized are\nbased on modifying the terms that give\nthe borrower an improved ability to meet\nthe contractual obligations. At June 30,\n2023, the amortized cost of residential\nmortgage loans that were granted a\npermanent modification during the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023 was $\n44million and $ 88million. The amortized\ncost of home equity loans that were\ngranted a permanent modification during\nthe same periods was $ 9million and $\n18million. The term extensions granted\nfor residential mortgage and home equity\npermanent modifications vary widely and\ncan be up to 30years, but are mostly in\nthe range of 1to 20years for both\nresidential mortgage and home equity\nloans. The weighted-average term\nextension of permanent modifications for\nresidential mortgage loans was 10.2years\nand 8.6years for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, while the\nweighted-average interest rate reduction\nwas 1.62percent and 1.57percent. For the\nsame periods, the weighted-average term\nextension of permanent modifications for\nhome equity loans was 16.9years and\n15.2years, while the weighted-average\ninterest rate reduction was 2.96percent\nand 2.69percent. Principal forgiveness\nand payment deferrals were insignificant\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2023. For consumer real estate\nborrowers in financial difficulty that\nreceived a forbearance, trial or\npermanent modification, there were no\ncommitments to lend additional funds at\nJune 30, 2023. Borrowers with a home\nequity line of credit that received a\nforbearance plan could have all or a\nportion of their lines reinstated in the\nfuture if they cure their payment\ndefault and meet certain Bank\nconditions. Chapter 7 Discharges: If a\nborrower\u2019s consumer real estate\nobligation is discharged in a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy proceeding, the contractual\npayment terms of the loan are not\nmodified, although they can no longer be\nenforced against the individual\nborrower. The Corporation\u2019s ability to\ncollect amounts due on the loan is\nlimited to enforcement against the\nproperty through the foreclosure and\nsale of the collateral. The Corporation\nwill only pursue foreclosure upon\ndefault by the borrower, and otherwise\nwill recover pursuant to the loan terms\nor at the time of a sale. Residential\nmortgage and home equity loans that were\ngranted a Chapter 7 discharge were\ninsignificant for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The\nCorporation tracks the performance of\nmodified loans to assess effectiveness\nof modification programs. Defaults of\nmodified consumer real estate loans\nsince January 1, 2023 were insignificant\nduring the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023.

The carrying value of consumer real estate\nloans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 724million and $\n871million. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 68million and $ 99million of consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are\nnot reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other\nConsumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan with a fixed interest rate. As of June 30,\n2023, substantially all payment plans provided to customers had a 60-month term.\nIn certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the\noutstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The\nCorporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the\nCorporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation\nagencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures\n(external programs). The June 30, 2023 amortized cost of credit card and other\nconsumer loans that were modified through these programs during the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 was $ 168million and $ 303million. The financial effect\nof modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate reduction of\n19.02percent and 18.82percent and principal forgiveness of $ 14million and $\n25million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The Corporation\ntracks the performance of modified loans to assess the effectiveness of\nmodification programs. Defaults of modified credit card and other consumer loans\nsince January 1, 2023 were insignificant during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023. Of the $ 303million in modified credit card and other consumer\nloans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of June 30, 2023, $\n237million were current, $ 35million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 31million\nwere greater than 90 days past due. These modifications represented 0.15percent of\noutstanding credit card and other consumer loans at June 30, 2023. Commercial\nLoans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing\nborrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the\nborrower\u2019s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while\nmitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily\nterm extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Bank\nforbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full\n(maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time.

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 10percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 17percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 , the\ncarrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were modified as\nTDRs was $ 796million and $ 1.3billion.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation\nhad commitments to lend $ 358million to\ncommercial borrowers whose loans were\nclassified as TDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment default was $\n105million at December 31, 2022. Loans\nHeld-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS\nof $ 6.8billion and $ 6.9billion at June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Cash and\nnon-cash proceeds from sales and\npaydowns of loans originally classified\nas LHFS were $ 7.4billion and $\n21.4billion for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022. Cash used for\noriginations and purchases of LHFS\ntotaled $ 7.3billion and $ 11.4billion\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022 . Also included were\n\nnon-cash net transfers into LHFS of $\n457million and $ 1.6billion for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nAccrued Interest Receivable Accrued\ninterest receivable for loans and leases\nand loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022 was $ 4.1billion\nand $ 3.8billion and is reported in\ncustomer and other receivableson the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Outstanding\ncredit card loan balances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and fees. Credit\ncard loans are not classified as\nnonperforming but are charged off no\nlater than the end of the month in which\nthe account becomes 180 days past due,\nwithin 60 days after receipt of\nnotification of death or bankruptcy, or\nupon confirmation of fraud . During the\nthree and six months ended June 30,\n2023, the Corporation reversed $\n138million and $ 256million of interest\nand fee income against the income\nstatement line item in which it was\noriginally recorded upon charge-off of\nthe principal balance of the loan\ncompared to $ 80million and $ 160million\nfor the same periods in 2022 . For the\noutstanding residential mortgage, home\nequity, direct/indirect consumer and\ncommercial loan balances classified as\nnonperforming during the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\ninterest and fee income reversed at the\ntime the loans were classified as\nnonperforming was not significant.

Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The June 30, 2023 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic scenarios, including a\nbaseline scenario derived from consensus\nestimates, which represents a mild\nrecessionary environment, an adverse\nscenario reflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall weighted economic outlook of\nthe above scenarios is estimating a\nrecessionary environment in 2023, which\nis relatively consistent with the\nweighted economic outlook estimated as\nof December 31, 2022. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes that the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate will be above\nfour and a half percent by the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and will remain above\nfivepercent through the fourth quarter\nof 2024. Additionally, in this economic\noutlook, U.S. real gross domestic\nproduct is forecasted to contract at\n0.2percent and grow at 1.0percent year-\nover-year in the fourth quarters of 2023\nand 2024. For\n\ncomparison, as of December 31, 2022, the\nweighted economic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nto be just above five and a half percent\nby the fourth quarter of 2023 and slowly\ndecline to fivepercent by the fourth\nquarter of 2024, and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product was forecasted to\ncontract at 0.4percent and grow at\n1.2percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2023 and 2024. The allowance\nfor credit losses increased $ 116million\nfrom December 31, 2022 to $ 14.3billion\nat June 30, 2023, which included a $\n505million reserve increase related to\nthe consumer portfolio and a $\n389million reserve decrease related to\nthe commercial portfolio. The increase\nin the allowance reflected a reserve\nbuild in the Corporation\u2019s consumer\nportfolio primarily due to credit card\nloan growth, partially offset by a\nreserve release in the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial portfolio primarily driven by\ncertain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. The allowance also includes\nthe impact of the accounting change to\nremove the recognition and measurement\nguidance on TDRs, which reduced the\nallowance for credit losses by $\n243million on January 1, 2023. The\nchange in the allowance for credit\nlosses was comprised of a net increase\nof $ 268million in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and a decrease of\n$ 152million in the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $ 602million to\n$ 1.1billion, and $ 1.5billion to $\n2.1billion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the same\nperiods in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the current-year\nperiods was driven by the Corporation\u2019s\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\ncredit card loan growth and asset\nquality, partially offset by certain\nimproved macroeconomic conditions that\nprimarily benefited the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial portfolio. For the same\nperiods in the prior year, the provision\nfor credit losses was primarily driven\nby loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset\nby asset quality improvement and reduced\nCOVID-19 pandemic uncertainties. In\naddition, the six-month period in the\nprior year was also driven by a reserve\nbuild related to Russian exposure.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption increased $ 6.9billion during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 primarily\ndriven by commercial loans, which\nincreased $ 7.0billion driven by broad-\nbased growth, and consumer loans, which\nremained flat as credit card growth was\noffset by declines in securities-based\nlending. The changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses, including net charge-\noffs and provision for loan and lease\nlosses, are detailed in the following\ntable.\n

Substantially all of\nthese securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are\ntypically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 7million and $\n17million net of hedges, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023\ncompared to $ 10million and $ 30million for the same periods in 2022, are not\nincluded in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n95.9billion and $ 105.8billion at June 30, 2023 and 2022. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 63million and $ 132million during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $ 74million and $ 144million\nfor the same periods in 2022. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including\nloans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $ 1.4billion and $\n1.6billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For more information on MSRs,\nsee Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . During the three and six months ended June\n30, 2023, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage\nsecuritization trusts with total assets of $ 296million and $ 624million compared\nto $ 36million and $ 563million for the same periods in 2022.

net of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans and leases in the consolidated\ncredit card trust included $ 3.7billion and $ 3.3billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America80                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit Card Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased\ncredit card loans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided\ninterest (seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained\ninterests, including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the\nsecuritized receivables and cash reserve accounts. During both the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, $ 1.0billion of new senior debt securities were\nissued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust. At June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued\nby the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $\n4.9billion and $ 6.7billion. These securities serve as a form of credit\nenhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent. During both the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, $ 161million\nof subordinate securities were issued by the credit card securitization trust.\nResecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into\nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities\nwith specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing\nactivities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the\nunilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $\n4.1billion and $ 5.8billion of securities during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 compared to $ 4.6billion and $ 14.2billion for the same periods in\n2022. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities\nprior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was\nrecorded. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n478million and $ 1.1billion compared to $ 1.0billion and $ 1.7billion, of which\nsubstantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets for\nboth periods. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair\nvalue were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond\nTrusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated,\nlong-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing\nfloating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term\nbasis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to\nunconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation\nwas transferor, totaled $ 2.2billion and $ 2.5billion at June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts\nat June 30, 2023 was 11.5years.

repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically\ncreated on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a\nspecific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation\u2019s\ninvolvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n935million and $ 914million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including the\nnotional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of\nlosses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs. Total assets of the consolidated and unconsolidated\nVIEs were $ 1.6billion and $ 1.5billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nCDO and CLO VIEs The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated CDO and CLO\nVIEs, that hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate\ndebt, ABS or non-investment grade corporate loans, which are funded by multiple\ntranches of debt instruments and equity securities issued by the VIEs. The VIEs\nare managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation held $ 16.2billion\nand $ 16.3billion of loans and securities issued by CDO and CLO VIEs at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s loss exposure is limited to its loan\nand debt security holdings and the notional amount of any derivatives to which the\nCorporation is a counterparty. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs and CLOs totaled $ 16.3billion at both June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which is insignificant to the total assets of the\nVIEs. Investment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing,\nwhich may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment\nVIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments\nand are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $ 463million and $ 854million.\nThe Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 18.8billion and $ 12.2billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 2.3billion and $ 2.4billion at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less\nnon-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.2billion at both June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars,\npower generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The\nnet investment represents the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds equity investments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these\nunconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 77.1billion and $ 74.8billion as of June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. An unrelated third party is typically the general\npartner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the\nVIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities\nare allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code\nand related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which\nvaries based on the type of investments. Tax credits from environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing are recognized ratably over\na term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from renewable energy investments are\nrecognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits\n(ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits\n(PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period. The volume and types of\ninvestments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits\nrecognized each period. The Corporation\u2019s equity investments in affordable housing\nand other projects totaled $ 15.1billion and $ 14.7billion at June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, which included unfunded capital contributions of $ 7.2billion\nand $ 6.9billion and are probable to be paid over the next five years. The\nCorporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled\naffordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not\nexpected to be significant. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nthe Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits related to\naffordable housing and other tax credit equity investments of $ 517million and $\n1.0billion compared to $ 423million and $ 842million for the same periods in 2022,\nand reported pretax losses in other income of $ 383million and $ 756million\ncompared to $ 345million and $ 682million for the same periods in 2022. The\nCorporation\u2019s equity investments in renewable energy totaled $ 14.0billion and $\n13.9billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In addition, the Corporation\nhad unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of $\n6.1billion and $ 1.9billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which are\ncontingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two years. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring the\nproject to qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Corporation recognized\ntax credits and other tax benefits related to renewable energy equity investments\nof $ 1.1billion and $ 2.1billion compared to $ 621million and $ 1.5billion for the\nsame periods in 2022 and reported pretax losses in other income of $ 567million\nand $ 1.1billion compared to $ 502million and $ 1.0billion for the same periods in\n2022. The Corporation may also enter into power purchase agreements with renewable\nenergy tax credit entities. The maximum loss exposure for tax credit VIEs was $\n29.1billion and $ 28.8billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\nThe table below presents goodwill\nbalances by business segment at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022.

that\nit is permitted by contract or practice\nto sell or repledge. At June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the fair value of\nthis collateral was $ 857.1billion and $\n827.6billion, of which $ 844.9billion\nand $ 764.1billion was sold or\nrepledged. The primary source of this\ncollateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell.\nFor more information on collateral, see\nNote 10 \u2013 Securities Financing\nAgreements, Short-term Borrowings,\nCollateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within\ncash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet of $\n5.5billion and $ 7.6billion,\npredominantly related to cash segregated\nin compliance with securities\nregulations and cash held on deposit\nwith central banks to meet reserve\nrequirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nCredit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.4billion at both June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022. The carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s credit\nextension commitments at June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\nvalue option, was $ 1.4billion and $\n1.6billion, which predominantly related\nto the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The carrying value of these\ncommitments is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Legally\nbinding commitments to extend credit\ngenerally have specified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of these commitments\nhave adverse change clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation against\ndeterioration in the borrower\u2019s ability\nto pay. The following table includes the\nnotional amount of commitments of $\n2.6billion and $ 3.0billion at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 75million and $\n110million at June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, which is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities.

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 24.3billion and $\n9.5billion at June 30, 2023, and $ 25.1billion and $ 9.5billion at December 31,\n2022. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 599million and $ 575million\nat June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 719million and $ 636million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 350million and $ 294million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation\nhad commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities\nborrowing agreements of $ 132.0billion and $ 92.0billion, and commitments to enter\ninto forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 77.5billion\nand $ 57.8billion. A significant portion of these commitments will expire within\nthe next 12months. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had a\ncommitment to originate or purchase up to $ 4.1billion and $ 3.7billion on a\nrolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This\ncommitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior\nnotice. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had unfunded\nequity investment commitments of $ 527million and $ 571million. Other Guarantees\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products\nthat offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At both June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 4.3billion.\nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related\nto these guarantees totaled $ 634million and $ 632million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable\nfor any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among\nother things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after\na purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The\nability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 436billion, is an estimate\nof the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of June 30, 2023. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a\ncardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation\nmitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or\nother types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for\ncontingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing\nactivity were not significant. Representations and Warranties Obligations and\nCorporate Guarantees For more information on representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and\ncorporate guarantees was $ 622million and $ 612million at June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America86                                                               \n                                                                                  \nBalance Sheet, and the related provision\nis included in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions, and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 48.7billion and $ 59.6billion at\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory\ntrust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the\nCorporation. Other Contingencies On May\n11, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) issued a proposed\nrule that would impose a special\nassessment to recover the loss to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising\nfrom the protection of uninsured\ndepositors of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank associated with their\nclosures, and the systemic risk\ndetermination announced by the FDIC on\nMarch 12, 2023. Under the proposed rule,\nthe assessment base for the special\nassessment would be equal to an insured\ndepository institution\u2019s estimated\nuninsured deposits reported as of\nDecember 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude\nthe first $5 billion in estimated\nuninsured deposits. The FDIC would\ncollect the special assessment over\neight quarterly periods, beginning with\nthe first quarterly assessment period of\n2024. In addition, the special\nassessment would be subject to\nadjustment as the estimated loss to the\nDIF is updated. While the timing and\namount of any expense recognition are\nunknown until the proposed rule is\nfinalized, if the final rule is issued\nas proposed, the estimated impact of the\nspecial assessment on the Corporation\nwould be a noninterest expense of\napproximately $ 1.9billion that would be\nrecognized upon finalization of the\nrule.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n276million and $ 365million was\nrecognized for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to $\n498million and $ 604million for the same\nperiods in 2022. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nfor which a loss in future periods is\nreasonably possible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued\nliability) and for representations and\nwarranties exposures, the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 0.8billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of June\n30, 2023. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure regarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities, management\ndoes not believe that loss contingencies\narising from pending matters, including\nthe matters described below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\n                                                                                  \n  87Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndisclosure, will have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the\nsignificant judgment, variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties involved\nin those matters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and\nthe very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Deposit Insurance\nAssessment On April 10, 2023, the\nmagistrate judge issued a report and\nrecommendation (the Report) for\nresolving the parties\u2019 pending summary\njudgment motions. The Report recommends\ngranting the FDIC motion for summary\njudgment on BANA\u2019s statutory liability\nfor the unpaid assessments, subject to\nBANA\u2019s statute of limitations defenses\nto assessments for the quarters ended\nMarch 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013,\non which the Report recommends that\nrelevant issues should be resolved at\ntrial. The Report also recommends\ndenying BANA\u2019s counterclaims challenging\nthe adoption of the relevant assessment\nregulations and granting BANA\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment on the FDIC\u2019s\nclaims for unjust enrichment and\ndisgorgement. The Report has been\nsubmitted to the district court judge\nfor consideration, and the parties have\nfiled objections to the recommendations\nin the Report. Representment Non-\nSufficient Fund Fees On July 11, 2023,\nit was announced that BANA agreed to\nsettle twoseparate proceedings with the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) and Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) related to\nBANA\u2019s assessing overdraft or\ninsufficient funds fees each time a\nmerchant resubmitted a transaction or\ncheck for payment after it had been\ndeclined due to insufficient funds\n(Representment Fees). Without admitting\nor denying the findings, BANA consented\nto orders requiring it to pay penalties\nof $ 60million to each of the OCC and\nCFPB. Under the CFPB Consent Order,\namong other things, BANA also consented\nto refund at least $ 80.4million to\ncustomers who were assessed\nRepresentment Fees between September 1,\n2018 to February 18, 2022. Credit Card\nSales and Marketing Practices On July\n11, 2023, it was announced that BANA\nagreed to a settlement with the CFPB\nrelated to online advertisements\nconcerning bonuses linked to rewards\ncredit cards and failure to provide\nthose bonuses to certain consumers, and\napplying for and opening credit cards\nfor consumers without their consent and\nobtaining credit reports for those\nconsumers. Without admitting or denying\nthe findings, BANA agreed to the entry\nof a Consent Order requiring payment of\na $ 30million penalty and certain\nundertakings concerning consumer\nredress.\n\nUnemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards\nBANA has been named as a defendant in a\nnumber of putative class action, mass\naction, and individual lawsuits in\nmultiple states related to its\nadministration of prepaid debit cards to\ndistribute unemployment and other state\nbenefits. These lawsuits generally\nassert claims for monetary damages and\ninjunctive relief. Class action and mass\naction lawsuits related to the\nCalifornia program, the largest program\nadministered by BANA measured by total\nbenefits and number of participants,\nhave been consolidated into a\nmultidistrict litigation (MDL) in the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California.

exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the\nmeasurement date. The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if\nthe significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent\nmarketplace. During the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, there were no changes to\nvaluation approaches or techniques that\nhad, or are expected to have, a material\nimpact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of\noperations. For more information\nregarding the fair value hierarchy, how\nthe Corporation measures fair value and\nvaluation techniques, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The Corporation accounts for\ncertain financial instruments under the\nfair value option.
