The\nfollowing highlights the significant\nchanges.\n\n\u25cf Service charges decreased $778 million\nfor the nine-month period primarily\ndriven by the impact of non-sufficient\nfunds and overdraft policy changes, as\nwell as lower treasury service charges.\n\n\u25cf Investment and brokerage services\nincreased $168 million for the three-\nmonth period primarily driven by higher\nasset management fees due to higher\naverage market levels and the impact of\npositive assets under management (AUM)\nflows, partially offset by lower\nbrokerage fees. The nine-month period\ndecreased $524 million primarily driven\nby lower asset management fees and\nbrokerage fees due to lower average\nequity and fixed income market levels\nand transactional volumes, partially\noffset by the impact of positive AUM\nflows.\n\n\u25cf Investment banking fees decreased $189\nmillion for the nine-month period\nprimarily due to lower debt issuance and\nadvisory fees, partially offset by\nhigher equity issuance fees.\n\n\u25cf Market making and similar activities\nincreased $257 million and $2.7 billion\nprimarily driven by improved trading in\ncredit and mortgage products in Fixed\nIncome, Currencies and Commodities\n(FICC) and by the impact of higher\ninterest rates on client financing\nactivities in Equities.\n\n\u25cf Other income decreased $340 million\nand $224 million primarily due to higher\npartnership losses on ESG investments\nand losses on sales of available-for-\nsale (AFS) debt securities in the nine-\nmonth period, partially offset by\ncertain negative valuation adjustments\nin the prior-year periods.\n                                                                                  \n  Provision for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $336 million to $1.2 billion\nand $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion for the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 compared to the same periods in\n2022. The provision for credit losses\nfor the current-year periods was driven\nby our consumer portfolio primarily due\nto credit card loan growth and asset\nquality, partially offset by certain\nimproved macroeconomic conditions that\nprimarily benefited our commercial\nportfolio. In addition, provision for\ncredit losses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 benefited from\ncommercial net paydowns. For the three-\nmonth period in the prior year, the\nprovision for credit losses was\nprimarily driven by loan growth and a\ndampened macroeconomic outlook, and the\nnine-month period in the prior year was\ndriven by the same factors as well as a\nreserve build related to Russian\nexposure , partially offset by asset\nquality improvement and reduced COVID-19\npandemic uncertainties.

The three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 also\nincluded discrete benefits of $212\nmillion and $422 million primarily\nrelated to certain U.S. state law\nchanges\n\nin the three-month period, as well as\nother discrete benefits primarily\nrelated to resolution of U.S. federal\nand state tax matters in the nine-month\nperiod. Absent the ESG tax credits and\ndiscrete tax benefits, the effective tax\nrates would have been 25 percent for\nboth the three months ended September\n30, 2023 and 2022, and 26 percent and 25\npercent for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America6                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Supplemental Financial Data                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and return\non average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity\nas key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income.

These\nincreases were driven by a strong\nperformance in FICC and Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $212\nmillion to $3.2 billion primarily driven\nby continued investments in the\nbusiness, including people and\ntechnology.\n\nAverage total assets increased $15.8\nbillion to $863.7 billion driven by\nhigher levels of inventory, increased\nsecured financing activity and loan\ngrowth in FICC, partially offset by\nlower levels of inventory in Equities.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 11 percent, up from 10 percent,\nreflecting higher net income partially\noffset by an increase in allocated\ncapital.

These increases\nwere driven by higher revenue in FICC,\npartially offset by lower revenue in\nEquities.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $686\nmillion to $9.9 billion primarily driven\nby the same factors as described in the\nthree-month discussion, partially offset\nby expenses recognized for certain\nregulatory matters in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nAverage total assets increased $12.6\nbillion to $870.4 billion due to the\nsame factors as described in the three-\nmonth discussion. Period-end total\nassets increased $52.3 billion from\nDecember 31, 2022 to $864.8 billion\ndriven by higher levels of inventory,\nincreased secured financing activity and\nloan growth in FICC, partially offset by\nlower levels of inventory in Equities.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 12 percent, unchanged from the same\nperiod a year ago.\n                                                                                  \n  Sales and Trading Revenue                                                       \n                                                                                  \nFor a description of sales and trading\nrevenue, see Business Segment Operations\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile against our risk appetite\nand risk capacity. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A.

Additionally, the Board\nauthorized common stock repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorizations, during the third quarter\nof 2023, we repurchased $1.0 billion of\ncommon stock, including repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans. In September 2023,\nthe Board modified the October 2021\nAuthorization, effective October 1,\n2023, to include repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans when determining the\nremaining repurchase authority. As of\nOctober 1, 2023, the remaining\nrepurchase authority was approximately\n$13.6 billion (including repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans).\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nRWA under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the PCA\nframework. As of September 30, 2023, the\nCET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital ratios under the Standardized\napproach were the binding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nG-SIB surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements were 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nand 9.5 percent under the Advanced\napproaches. Effective October 1, 2023,\nour CET1 minimum requirement is 9.5\npercent under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase 50 bps on\nJanuary 1, 2024, which would increase\nour minimum CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement. At September 30, 2023, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its current CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement as well as the minimum\nrequirement expected to be in place as\nof January 1, 2024 due to the\nanticipated increase in our G-SIB\nsurcharge.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America22                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.

allows a five-year transition\nperiod related to the adoption of the\ncurrent expected credit losses (CECL)\naccounting standard on January 1, 2020.\n\n(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum\nis the sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches) or the\nSCB of 3.4 percent (under the\nStandardized approach), as applicable,\nat both September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022. The countercyclical capital\nbuffer was zero for both periods. The\nSLR regulatory minimum includes a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt September 30, 2023, CET1 capital was\n$194.2 billion, an increase of $14.2\nbillion from December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by dividends and common stock\nrepurchases. Tier 1 capital increased\n$14.2 billion primarily driven by the\nsame factors as CET1 capital. Total\ncapital under the Standardized approach\nincreased $12.4 billion primarily due to\nthe same factors driving the increase in\nTier 1 capital and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital, partially\noffset by a decrease in subordinated\n\ndebt. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at September 30, 2023,\nincreased $27.5 billion during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 to\n$1,632 billion primarily due to higher\ncounterparty exposures in Global Markets\nand loan growth. Supplementary leverage\nexposure at September 30, 2023 increased\n$73.9 billion primarily due to higher\ncash held at central banks, partially\noffset by lower debt securities\nbalances.\n

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Developments                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nOn July 27, 2023, U.S. banking\nregulators issued proposed rules that\nwould update future U.S. regulatory\ncapital requirements. Under the capital\nproposal, the Advanced approaches would\nbe replaced with a new standardized\napproach, referred to as the expanded\nrisk-based approach, which would be\nphased in over a three-year period\nbeginning July 1, 2025. U.S. banking\nregulators also issued proposed rules to\nrevise the risk-based capital surcharge\nfor G-SIBs, which would be effective two\ncalendar quarters after finalization. On\nAugust 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators\nissued proposed rules that would change\nthe criteria for debt instruments\nincluded in the Corporation\u2019s eligible\nlong-term debt and TLAC. Any final rules\nissued are subject to change from the\ncurrent proposals. The Corporation is\nevaluating the potential impact of the\nproposed rules on its regulatory\ncapital, eligible long-term debt and\nTLAC requirements.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\nFenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). On\nAugust 13, 2023, Merrill Lynch\nProfessional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC)\nmerged into its immediate parent, BofAS.\nPrior to that date, MLPCC was a fully-\nguaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and\nprovided clearing and settlement\nservices as well as prime brokerage and\narranged financing services for\ninstitutional clients. Following the\nmerger, client services previously\nprovided by MLPCC are now being provided\nby or through BofAS.\n\nThe Corporation's principal European\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill\nLynch International (MLI) and BofA\nSecurities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its minimum capital\nrequirements as an alternative net\ncapital broker-dealer under Rule\n15c3-1e, and MLPF&S computes its minimum\ncapital requirements in accordance with\nthe alternative standard under Rule\n15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures\ncommission merchant and is subject to\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission\n(CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are also registered\nwith the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, BofAS had tentative\nnet capital of $25.1 billion. BofAS also\nhad regulatory net capital of $23.0\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of $4.3 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $6.2 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $136\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\nis regulated by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the Financial\nConduct Authority and is subject to\ncertain regulatory capital requirements.\nAt September 30, 2023, MLI\u2019s capital\nresources were $33.7 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $10.8 billion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution\nwith its head office located in France,\nis regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the\nAutorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and\nsupervised under the Single Supervisory\nMechanism by the European Central Bank.\nAt September 30, 2023, BofASE's capital\nresources were $9.2 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum Pillar 1\nrequirement of $3.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became\nconditionally registered with the SEC as\nsecurity-based swap dealers in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, and maintained\nnet liquid assets at September 30, 2023\nthat exceeded the applicable minimum\nrequirements under the Exchange Act.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity Risk                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur primary liquidity risk management\nobjective is to meet expected or\nunexpected cash flow and collateral\nrequirements, including payments under\nlong-term debt agreements, commitments\nto extend credit and customer deposit\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support\nour businesses and customers under a\nrange of economic conditions. To achieve\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America26                                                               \n                                                                                  \nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nstress from increased volatility due to\nthe failure of certain financial\ninstitutions in the first half of 2023.\nOur practices have also allowed us to\neffectively manage market fluctuations\nfrom the rising interest rate\nenvironment, inflationary pressures and\nchanges in the macroeconomic\nenvironment. We define liquidity as\nreadily available assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we can use\nto meet our contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations as they arise. We\nmanage our liquidity position through\nline-of-business and ALM activities, as\nwell as through our legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and current\n(including intraday) basis under both\nexpected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity management\nenhances our ability to monitor\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.

NB Holdings\nCorporation Bank of America Corporation,\nas the parent company (the Parent),\nwhich is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, has an intercompany\narrangement with our wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary, NB Holdings\nCorporation (NB Holdings). We have\ntransferred, and agreed to transfer,\nadditional Parent assets not required to\nsatisfy anticipated near-term\nexpenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent\nis expected to continue to have access\nto the same flow of dividends, interest\nand other amounts of cash necessary to\nservice its debt, pay dividends and\nperform other obligations as it would\nhave had it not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets.\nThese arrangements support our preferred\nsingle point of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the Parent\nwould be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. Global Liquidity\nSources and Other Unencumbered Assets We\nmaintain liquidity available to the\nCorporation, including the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, in the form of\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of assets\nthat are readily available to the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, including\nholding company, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash\n\nis primarily on deposit with the Federal\nReserve Bank and, to a lesser extent,\ncentral banks outside of the U.S. We\nlimit the composition of high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and other investment-grade\nsecurities, and a select group of\nnon-U.S. government securities. We can\nobtain cash for these securities, even\nin stressed conditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or outright sales.\nWe hold our GLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the liquidity\nrequirements of our global businesses,\nand we consider the impact of potential\nregulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 13 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                  \n                                              Three Months                        \n  Table 13          Average Global                   Ended                        \n  (Dollars in       Liquidity                 September 30           December 31  \n  billions)         Sources                           2023                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                        $               693    $              694  \n  Nonbank and                                                                     \n  other                                                166                   174  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               859    $              868  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $327 billion and\n$348 billion at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 14 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.\n                                                                                  \n                    Average Global            Three Months                        \n  Table 14          Liquidity                        Ended                        \n  (Dollars in       Sources                   September 30           December 31  \n  billions)         Composition                       2023                  2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                              $               350    $              174  \n  deposit                                                                         \n  U.S. Treasury                                        136                   252  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-back\u2026                                                                  \n  securities,                                          357                   427  \n  and other                                                                       \n  investment-gr\u2026                                                                  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                            16                    15  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global                               $               859    $              868  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nrules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $582 billion and $605 billion for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For the same periods, the\naverage consolidated LCR was 116 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due\nto normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We\nutilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate\namounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet\ncontractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more\ninformation on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk \u2013 Liquidity Stress\nAnalysis in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net\nStable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a\none-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to\nlend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions\nand is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The\nU.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a\n\nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30,\n2023, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance\nwith the U.S. NSFR. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with\na mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized,\nglobally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs,\nmarkets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our\nlending activities through our deposits, which were $1.88 trillion and $1.93\ntrillion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our trading activities in\nother regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through\nsecurities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on\ncustomer activity and market conditions. Deposits Our deposit base is well-\ndiversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments.\nAt September 30, 2023, 52 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15\npercent in GWIM and 26 percent in Global Banking . We consider a substantial\nportion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of\nliquidity. At September 30, 2023, approximately 67 percent of consumer and small\nbusiness deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by\nclients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 30 percent and 34 percent of our\ndeposits were noninterest-bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer\nand commercial clients. Deposits at September 30, 2023 decreased $45.7 billion, or\ntwo percent, from December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in customer\nspending and debt payments, customers\u2019 movement of balances to higher yielding\ninvestment alternatives and seasonal outflows. Long-term Debt During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we issued $54.0 billion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $23.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $18.7 billion of notes issued by\nBank of America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions\nin the aggregate of $33.0 billion consisting of $22.5 billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $4.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.9 billion of other\ndebt.

For more\ninformation on our TLAC eligible and\ncallable outstanding notes, see\nLiquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified Funding\nSources in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt increased $14.4\nbillion to $290.4 billion during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023\nprimarily due to debt issuances,\npartially offset by debt maturities,\nredemptions, repurchases and valuation\nadjustments. We may, from time to time,\npurchase outstanding debt instruments in\nvarious transactions, depending on\nmarket conditions, liquidity and other\nfactors. Our other regulated entities\nmay also make markets in our debt\ninstruments to provide liquidity for\ninvestors.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, we issued $11.3 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price.

Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, our asset quality remained\nrelatively healthy. Our net charge-off\nratio increased primarily driven by\ncredit card loans, as delinquency trends\ncontinue to slowly increase off of\nhistoric lows; however,\n\nthey remain below the same period in\n2019. Nonperforming loans increased\nmodestly compared to December 31, 2022\ndriven by the commercial real estate\noffice property type, while commercial\nreservable criticized exposure increased\ndriven by both office as well as other\nindustries that have been impacted by\nthe current environment. Uncertainty\nremains regarding broader economic\nimpacts as a result of inflationary\npressures, rising rates and the current\ngeopolitical environment and could lead\nto adverse impacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus, and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions as well\nas portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable and home\nprices have increased slightly in recent\nmonths. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, net charge-\noffs increased $345 million and $853\nmillion to $804 million and $2.2 billion\ncompared to the same periods in 2022\nprimarily due to late-stage delinquent\ncredit card loans that were charged off.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses increased $930 million\nduring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 to $8.2 billion.

balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio of\n$2.2 billion remained relatively\nunchanged during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Of the nonperforming\nresidential mortgage loans at September\n30, 2023, $1.3 billion, or 61 percent,\nwere current on contractual payments.\nLoans accruing past due 30 days or more\nincreased $81 million.\n\nOf the $218.1 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat September 30, 2023, $62.8 billion, or\n29 percent, of loans were originated as\ninterest-only. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.5 billion, or six percent,\nat September 30, 2023. Residential\nmortgage loans that have entered the\namortization period generally experience\na higher rate of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a whole. At September 30,\n2023, $66 million, or two percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $925\nmillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe\n\nentire residential mortgage portfolio.\nIn addition, at September 30, 2023, $199\nmillion, or six percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere nonperforming, of which $63 million\nwere contractually current. Loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of 3 to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n\nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nof outstandings at both September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022.

Of the nonperforming home\nequity loans at September 30, 2023, $273\nmillion, or 57 percent, were current on\ncontractual payments. In addition, $118\nmillion, or 25 percent, were 180 days or\nmore past due and had been written down\nto the estimated fair value of the\ncollateral, less costs to sell. Accruing\nloans that were 30 days or more past due\nremained relatively unchanged during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOf the $25.5 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nSeptember 30, 2023, as shown in Table\n21, 11 percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that had reached the end of their\ndraw period and entered the amortization\nperiod was $4.3 billion at\n\nSeptember 30, 2023. The HELOCs that have\nentered the amortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and nonperforming\nstatus when compared to the HELOC\nportfolio as a whole. At September 30,\n2023, $45 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nSeptember 30, 2023, $310 million, or\nseven percent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, 29 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n                                                                                  \n  33Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type.

During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023,\ncommercial credit quality deteriorated\nas nonperforming commercial loans and\nreservable criticized utilized exposure\nincreased primarily driven by the\ncommercial real estate office property\ntype; however, the commercial net\ncharge-off ratio of 0.10 percent for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023\nremained low.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2022; however, we are\nclosely monitoring borrower performance\nin the increased rate environment and\nemerging trends. Many commercial real\nestate markets are still experiencing\ndisruptions in demand, supply chain\nchallenges, tenant difficulties and\nchallenging capital markets. Recent\ndemand for office space has been\nstagnant, and future demand for office\nspace continues to be uncertain as\ncompanies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $325 million\nduring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 to $5.1 billion, primarily\ndriven by certain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 42.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure decreased $4.0 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023\nto $700.9 billion primarily driven by\nlower standby letters of credit (SBLCs)\nand financial guarantees and debt\nsecurities and other investments.

outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. PPP loans decreased $593 million\nduring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 primarily due to repayment of\nthe loans by the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) under the terms of\nthe program. Excluding PPP, credit card-\nrelated products were 55 percent and 53\npercent of the U.S. small business\ncommercial portfolio at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 and\nrepresented 100 percent and 99 percent\nof the net charge-offs for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023\ncompared to 100 percent for both the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2022. The decrease of $170 million\nin accruing past due 90 days or more for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas driven by the repayment of PPP\nloans, which are fully guaranteed by the\nSBA.\n\nNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases\nand Foreclosed Properties Activity\n\nTable 31 presents the nonperforming\ncommercial loans, leases and foreclosed\nproperties activity during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022. Nonperforming loans do not include\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, nonperforming\ncommercial loans and leases increased\n$987 million to $2.0 billion. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, 99 percent of\ncommercial nonperforming loans, leases\nand foreclosed properties were secured,\nand 63 percent were contractually\ncurrent. Commercial nonperforming loans\nwere carried at 89 percent of their\nunpaid principal balance, as the\ncarrying value of these loans has been\nreduced to the estimated collateral\nvalue less costs to sell.\n                                                                                  \n             Nonperf\u2026                                                             \n

Total commercial committed\nexposure increased $16.0 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023\nto $1.2 trillion. The increase in\ncommercial committed exposure was\nconcentrated in Asset managers and\nfunds, Capital goods, and Retailing.\n\nFor information on industry limits, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations in\nthe MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $173.5 billion, increased\n$8.4 billion, primarily driven by\nexposure to the Capital markets industry\ngroup during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry\nconcentration with committed exposure of\n$99.8 billion remained relatively\nunchanged during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. For more information\non the commercial real estate and\nrelated portfolios, see Commercial\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management \u2013\nCommercial Real Estate on page 38.\n\nCapital goods, our third largest\nindustry concentration with committed\nexposure of $93.3 billion, increased\n$6.0 billion, or seven percent, during\nthe nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase in committed exposure\noccurred primarily as a result of\nincreases in Trading companies and\ndistributors and Machinery, partially\noffset by a decrease in Industrial\nconglomerates.\n\nThere is uncertainty in the U.S. and\nglobal economies due to various\nmacroeconomic challenges including\ngeopolitical, inflationary pressures and\nelevated interest rates, and a number of\nindustries may continue to be adversely\nimpacted due to these conditions.

To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased\nin our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $8.9 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $23 million and $134\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to net\nlosses of $56 million and $66 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset\nby gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for\nthese exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in\nTable 38. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing\n\nactivities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of\nbusiness through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than\nthrough country risk governance.

three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 were\n$931 million and $2.6 billion compared\nto $520 million and $1.5 billion for the\nsame periods in 2022 primarily due to\nlate-stage delinquent credit card loans\nthat were charged off. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $336 million to\n$1.2 billion and $1.8 billion to $3.3\nbillion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 compared to the\nsame periods in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the current-year\nperiods was driven by our consumer\nportfolio primarily due to credit card\nloan growth and asset quality, partially\noffset by certain improved macroeconomic\nconditions that primarily benefited our\ncommercial portfolio. In addition,\nprovision for credit losses for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023\nbenefited from commercial net paydowns.\nFor the three-month period in the prior\nyear, the provision for credit losses\nwas primarily driven by loan growth and\na dampened macroeconomic outlook and the\nnine-month period was driven by the same\nfactors as well as a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure, partially\noffset by asset quality improvement and\nreduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the\nconsumer portfolio, including unfunded\nlending commitments, increased $496\nmillion to $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion\nto $3.3 billion for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 compared\nto the same periods in 2022. The\nprovision for credit losses for the\ncommercial portfolio, including unfunded\nlending commitments, decreased $160\nmillion to $16 million and decreased\n$278 million to $26 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 compared to the same periods in\n2022.\n\nTable 37 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022.

For more information on market\nrisks, see the Market section within\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 38 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 38 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges.

Table 41 shows the pretax impact\nto forecasted net interest income over\nthe next 12 months from September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 resulting\nfrom instantaneous parallel and non-\nparallel shocks to the market-based\nforward curve. Periodically, we evaluate\nthe scenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar\ninterest rates are floored at zero.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, the overall decrease in asset\nsensitivity of our balance sheet to\nhigher and lower rate scenarios was\nprimarily due to changes in deposit\nproduct mix. We continue to be asset\nsensitive to a parallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the majority of that\nimpact coming from the short end of the\nyield curve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates negatively impact the\nfair value of our debt securities\nclassified as available for sale and\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in alternate\ninterest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 41 assumes no change\nin deposit portfolio size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios,\nthe increase in net interest income\nwould be impacted by any customer\nactivity resulting in the replacement of\nlow-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits\nwith higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding as our benefit in those\nscenarios would be reduced. Conversely,\nin lower-rate scenarios, any customer\nactivity that results in the replacement\nof higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits would\nreduce our exposure in those scenarios.\n\nFor interest rate scenarios larger than\n100 bps shifts, it is expected that the\ninterest rate sensitivity will\nillustrate non-linear behaviors as there\nare numerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing\nwill have non-linear impacts to larger\nshort-end rate movements. In decreasing\ninterest rate scenarios, and\nparticularly where interest rates have\ndecreased to small amounts, the ability\nto further reduce rates paid is reduced\nas customer rates near zero. In higher\nshort-end rate scenarios, deposit\npricing will likely increase at a faster\nrate, leading to incremental interest\nexpense and reducing asset sensitivity.\nWhile the impact related to the above\nassumptions used in the asset\nsensitivity analysis can provide\ndirectional analysis on how net interest\nincome will be impacted in changing\nenvironments, the ultimate impact is\ndependent upon the interrelationship of\nthe assumptions and factors, which vary\nin different macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 41.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives\n\nin accounting hedges to manage\nsubstantially all of the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations.\nBy hedging the foreign exchange risk of\nour foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in\nthis area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on\nIRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThere were no significant gains or\nlosses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the hedge portfolio,\nfor the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the physical impacts of climate\nchange, driven by extreme weather events\nsuch as hurricanes and floods, as well\nas chronic longer-term shifts such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels, and (2) risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\nThese changes and events may have broad\nimpacts on operations, supply chains,\ndistribution networks, customers and\nmarkets and are otherwise referred to,\nrespectively, as physical risk and\ntransition risk. These risks may impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. Physical climate events may lead\nto increased credit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or\ncollateral value, or increased\noperational risk by impacting the\nCorporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\ncustomers or vendors. Climate-related\ntransition changes in policy, technology\nor the market may amplify credit risk\nthrough financial impacts to the\nCorporation or its customers or\ncounterparties or increase market risk,\nincluding through sudden price\nadjustments. In addition, reputational\nrisk may arise, including from our\nclimate-related practices, disclosures\nand commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAs climate risk spans all key risk\ntypes, we have developed and continue to\nenhance processes to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into our Risk Framework\nand risk management programs established\nfor each of our seven key types of risk.\n\nWe publicly announced our commitment to\nachieve net zero emissions in our\nfinancing activities, operations, and\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal). In connection with our Net Zero\nGoal, we set certain 2030 targets,\nincluding reducing emissions associated\nwith our operations and financing\nactivities, related to auto\nmanufacturing, energy and power\ngeneration, and for our supply chain,\nincluding that a certain proportion of\nour global suppliers set their own\nclimate targets (2030 Targets). We\ndisclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed\nemission and emission intensity metrics\nfor the above referenced sectors in our\n2022 Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) Report,\nwith 2019 serving as the baseline for\nour financed emissions targets.\n\nWe plan to disclose the financed\nemissions for additional portions of our\nbusiness loan portfolio in our 2023 TCFD\nReport, which we anticipate publishing\nlater in 2023, and we plan to set\nfinancing activity emission reduction\ntargets for other key sectors by April\n2024.\n\nAchieving our climate-related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero Goal and\n2030 Targets, may require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, new standards and\npublic policies, including those that\nimprove the cost of capital for the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well\nas ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith customers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.\n\nGiven the extended period of these and\nother climate-related goals we have\nestablished, our initiatives have not\nresulted in a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\nposition in the relevant periods\npresented herein.\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework and climate risk management\nprocess, see the Managing Risk and\nClimate Risk Management sections in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such that the\nresults of any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current-\nperiod presentation. New Accounting\nStandard Issued Investments \u2013 Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures The FASB\nupdated its guidance on the accounting\nfor tax credit investments, which\npermits entities to make an accounting\n\npolicy election to apply the\nproportional amortization method when\ncertain conditions are met. The new\naccounting guidance is effective on a\nretrospective or modified retrospective\nbasis beginning on January 1, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted. If adopted,\nthe Corporation does not expect the\nguidance to have a material impact on\nits consolidated financial position or\nresults of operations. New Accounting\nStandard Adopted Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses On January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting\nand disclosure requirements for expected\ncredit losses (ECL) that removed the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and\nadded disclosures on the financial\neffect and subsequent performance of\ncertain types of modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Upon adoption of the\nstandard, the Corporation recorded a\nreduction of $ 243million in the\nallowance for credit losses for the\nimpact of changes in the methodology\nused to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses for non-collateral\ndependent consumer and commercial TDRs.\nThere was no impact to the valuation of\nloans previously classified as\ncollateral-dependent TDRs. After\nadjusting for deferred taxes, the\nCorporation recorded an increase of $\n184million in retained earnings through\na cumulative-effect adjustment. The\nadditional disclosures are included in\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses on a\nprospective basis and include loan\nmodifications where the contractual\npayment terms of the borrower\u2019s loan\nagreement were modified through a\nrefinancing or restructuring.\nModifications that do not impact the\ncontractual payment terms, such as\ncovenant waivers, insignificant payment\ndeferrals, and any modifications made to\nloans carried at fair value, loans held-\nfor-sale (LHFS) and leases are not\nincluded in the disclosures. The\nCorporation uses various indicators to\nidentify borrowers in financial\ndifficulty. Consumer loan borrowers that\nare delinquent and commercial loan\nborrowers that are rated substandard or\nworse are the primary criteria used to\nidentify borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. If a borrower is\ncurrent at the time of modification, the\nloan generally remains a performing loan\nas long as there is demonstrated\nperformance prior to the modification,\nand payment in full under the modified\nterms is expected. Otherwise, the loan\nis placed on nonaccrual status and\nreported as nonperforming, excluding\nfully-insured consumer real estate\nloans, until there is sustained\nrepayment performance for a reasonable\nperiod. The allowance for loan and lease\nlosses for modified loans is determined\nin a manner consistent with the\nmethodology for the respective class and\ncredit rating of the financing\nreceivable as described in Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022.

At September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these\nhedging relationships was $ 21.3billion and $ 21.4billion, of which $ 17.3billion\nand $ 9.2billion were designated in a portfolio layer hedging relationship. At\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the cumulative adjustment associated\nwith these hedging relationships was a decrease of $ 741million and $ 451million.\n(4) Carrying value represents amortized cost.\n(5) Represents hedging activities related to certain commodities inventory.\nCash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The following table summarizes certain\ninformation related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Of the $ 12.3billion after-tax\nnet loss ($ 16.3billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at September 30,\n2023, losses of $ 4.7billion after-tax ($ 6.2billion pretax) related to both open\nand terminated cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in\nthe next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to\nprimarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For\nopen cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is approximately ten years. For terminated cash flow\nhedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized\nin interest income is approximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond\nthis time period being insignificant.\n                                                                                  \n  59Bank of America

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 4.3billion and $ 4.8billion of non-U.S. government-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic\nexposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection\nwith these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.3billion\nand $ 4.9billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the fair value of the transferred securities was $ 4.2billion and $\n4.7billion. Sales and Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading\nderivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising\nfrom trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to\ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include\nderivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these\nderivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global\nMarkets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table, which includes both\nderivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the\nrespective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and\ntrading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America62                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit-related Contingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain credit\nrisk-related contingent features,\nprimarily in the form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and credit support\ndocumentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n104.6billion and $ 101.3billion and\nposted cash and securities collateral of\n$ 84.1billion and $ 81.2billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries.

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n

Alternatively, the Corporation may\noffer the borrower a payment plan, which\nallows the borrower to repay past due\namounts through payments over a defined\nperiod. At September 30, 2023, the\namortized cost of residential mortgage\nloans that were modified through these\nplans during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 was $\n270million and $ 437million. The\namortized cost of home equity loans that\nwere modified through these plans during\nthe same periods was $ 39million and $\n64million. The weighted-average duration\nof residential mortgage loan\nmodifications was approximately 4months\nand 8months for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. For the\nsame periods, the weighted-average\nduration for home equity loan\nmodifications was approximately 4months\nand 9months. The total forborne payments\nfor residential mortgage loan\nmodifications was $ 6million and $\n19million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023. For the same\nperiods, the total forborne payments for\nhome equity modifications was $ 2million\nand $ 7million. If a borrower is unable\nto fulfill their obligations under the\nforbearance plans, they may be offered a\ntrial or permanent modification. Trial\nModifications : Trial modification plans\ngenerally consist of the Corporation\noffering a borrower modified loan terms\nthat reduce their contractual payments\ntemporarily over a three-to- four-\nmonthtrial period. If the customer\nsuccessfully makes the modified payments\nduring the trial period and formally\naccepts the modified terms, the modified\nloan terms become permanent. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, the amortized cost\nof residential mortgage loans entering\ntrial modifications during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 was\n$ 33million and $ 83million. The\namortized cost of home equity loans\nentering trial modifications during the\nsame periods was $ 10million and $\n31million.\n\nPermanent Modifications : Permanent\nmodifications include borrowers that\nhave completed a trial modification and\nhave had their contractual payment terms\npermanently modified, as well as\nborrowers that proceed directly to a\npermanent modification without a trial\nperiod. In a permanent modification, the\nborrower\u2019s payment terms are typically\nmodified in more than one manner but\ngenerally include a term extension and\nan interest rate reduction. At times,\nthe permanent modification may also\ninclude principal forgiveness and/or a\ndeferral of past due principal and\ninterest amounts to the end of the loan\nterm. The combinations utilized are\nbased on modifying the terms that give\nthe borrower an improved ability to meet\nthe contractual obligations. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, the amortized cost\nof residential mortgage loans that were\ngranted a permanent modification during\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $ 47million and $\n128million. The amortized cost of home\nequity loans that were granted a\npermanent modification during the same\nperiods was $ 9million and $ 26million.\nThe term extensions granted for\nresidential mortgage and home equity\npermanent modifications vary widely and\ncan be up to 30years, but are mostly in\nthe range of 1to 20years for both\nresidential mortgage and home equity\nloans. The weighted-average term\nextension of permanent modifications for\nresidential mortgage loans was 12.1years\nand 9.9years for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, while\nthe weighted-average interest rate\nreduction was 1.31percent and\n1.50percent. For the same periods, the\nweighted-average term extension of\npermanent modifications for home equity\nloans was 17.2years and 16.2years, while\nthe weighted-average interest rate\nreduction was 2.69percent and\n3.11percent. Principal forgiveness and\npayment deferrals were insignificant for\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. For consumer real\nestate borrowers in financial difficulty\nthat received a forbearance, trial or\npermanent modification, there were no\ncommitments to lend additional funds at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Borrowers with a\nhome equity line of credit that received\na forbearance plan could have all or a\nportion of their lines reinstated in the\nfuture if they cure their payment\ndefault and meet certain Bank\nconditions. Chapter 7 Discharges: If a\nborrower\u2019s consumer real estate\nobligation is discharged in a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy proceeding, the contractual\npayment terms of the loan are not\nmodified, although they can no longer be\nenforced against the individual\nborrower. The Corporation\u2019s ability to\ncollect amounts due on the loan is\nlimited to enforcement against the\nproperty through the foreclosure and\nsale of the collateral. The Corporation\nwill only pursue foreclosure upon\ndefault by the borrower, and otherwise\nwill recover pursuant to the loan terms\nor at the time of a sale. Residential\nmortgage and home equity loans that were\ngranted a Chapter 7 discharge were\ninsignificant for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The\nCorporation tracks the performance of\nmodified loans to assess effectiveness\nof modification programs. Defaults of\nmodified residential mortgage and home\nequity loans since January 1, 2023 were\n$ 160million and $ 26million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe table below provides aging\ninformation as of September 30, 2023 for\nconsumer real estate loans modified\nsince January 1, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America74                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Consumer                                                                        \n  Real Estate                                                                     \n  - Payment                                                                       \n  Status of                                                                       \n  Modificati\u2026                                                                     \n  to                                                                              \n  Borrowers                                                                       \n  in                                                                              \n  Financial                                                                       \n  Difficulty\u2026           Current                                                   \n  (Dollars in         September       30\u201389 Days       90+ Days                   \n  millions)            30, 2023         Past Due       Past Due       Total       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Residential    $          295    $         114    $       156    $         565  \n  mortgage                                                                        \n  Home equity                51               11             28               90  \n  Total          $          346    $         125    $       184    $         655  \n                                                                                  \n(1) Excludes trial modifications and Chapter 7 discharges\nConsumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $ 93million and $ 121million at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The carrying value of consumer real\nestate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings were in process at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $\n684million and $ 871million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022, the Corporation reclassified $ 86million and $ 151million of consumer real\nestate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure\nof certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other\nassets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,\naccordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit\nCard and Other Consumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily\nmodified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly\nreduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, substantially all payment plans provided to customers had a\n60-monthterm. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of\nthe outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The\nCorporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the\nCorporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation\nagencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures\n(external programs). The September 30, 2023 amortized cost of credit card and\nother consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $ 196million and $ 455million. The\nweighted-average interest rate reduction for the modifications was 19.40percent\nand 19.02percent, and principal forgiveness was $ 16million and $ 41million during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Corporation tracks the\nperformance of modified loans to assess the effectiveness of modification\nprograms. Defaults of modified credit card and other consumer loans since January\n1, 2023 were insignificant during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Of the $ 455million in modified credit card and other consumer loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of September 30, 2023, $ 370million\nwere current, $ 47million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 38million were greater\nthan 90 days past due. These modifications represented 0.22percent of outstanding\ncredit card and other consumer loans at September 30, 2023. Commercial Loans\nModifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nare designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing borrowers\nwith an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower\u2019s\nindividual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating\nthe Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term\nextensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Bank\nforbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full\n(maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates\nand principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal\nforgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other\nsettlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan.

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 12percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 20percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans During the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 ,\nthe carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were modified as\nTDRs was $ 745million and $ 1.7billion.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation\nhad commitments to lend $ 358million to\ncommercial borrowers whose loans were\nclassified as TDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment default was $\n105million at December 31, 2022. Loans\nHeld-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS\nof $ 7.6billion and $ 6.9billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. Cash and non-\n\ncash proceeds from sales and paydowns of\nloans originally classified as LHFS were\n$ 10.8billion and $ 27.8billion for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022. Cash used for originations and\npurchases of LHFS totaled $ 11.5billion\nand $ 18.7billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022 . Also\nincluded were non-cash net transfers\ninto LHFS of $ 634million and $\n2.1billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022. Accrued\nInterest Receivable Accrued interest\nreceivable for loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 was $\n4.3billion and $ 3.8billion and is\nreported in customer and other\nreceivableson the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, the\nCorporation\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nreversed $ 152million and $ 409million\nof interest and fee income against the\nincome statement line item in which it\nwas originally recorded upon charge-off\nof the principal balance of the loan\ncompared to $ 81million and $ 241million\nfor the same periods in 2022 .\n\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 and 2022, interest and fee\nincome reversed at the time the loans\nwere classified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The September 30, 2023 estimate\nfor allowance for credit losses was\nbased on various economic scenarios,\nincluding a baseline scenario derived\nfrom consensus estimates, an adverse\nscenario reflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall weighted economic outlook of\nthe above scenarios is estimating a mild\nrecessionary environment in late 2023\nand early 2024, which has modestly\nimproved compared to the weighted\neconomic outlook\n\nestimated as of December 31, 2022. The\nweighted economic outlook assumes that\nthe U.S. average unemployment rate will\nbe just above fivepercent by the fourth\nquarter of 2024 and will remain near\nthis level through the fourth quarter of\n2025. Additionally, in this economic\noutlook, U.S. real gross domestic\nproduct is forecasted to grow at\n0.5percent and at 1.6percent year-over-\nyear in the fourth quarters of 2024 and\n2025. The allowance for credit losses\nincreased $ 418million from December 31,\n2022 to $ 14.6billion at September 30,\n2023, which included a $ 921million\nreserve increase related to the consumer\nportfolio and a $ 503million reserve\ndecrease related to the commercial\nportfolio. The increase in the allowance\nreflected a reserve build in the\nCorporation\u2019s consumer portfolio\nprimarily due to credit card loan growth\nand asset quality, partially offset by a\nreserve release in the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial portfolio primarily driven by\ncertain improved macroeconomic\nconditions. The allowance also includes\nthe impact of the accounting change to\nremove the recognition and measurement\nguidance on TDRs, which reduced the\nallowance for credit losses by $\n243million on January 1, 2023. The\nchange in the allowance for credit\nlosses was comprised of a net increase\nof $ 605million in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and a decrease of\n$ 187million in the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $ 336million to\n$ 1.2billion, and $ 1.8billion to $\n3.3billion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 compared to the\nsame periods in 2022. The provision for\ncredit losses for the current-year\nperiods was driven by the Corporation\u2019s\nconsumer portfolio primarily due to\ncredit card loan growth and asset\nquality, partially offset by certain\nimproved macroeconomic conditions that\nprimarily benefited the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial portfolio. In addition,\nprovision for credit losses for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023\nbenefited from commercial net paydowns.\nFor the three-month period in the prior\nyear, the provision for credit losses\nwas primarily driven by loan growth and\na dampened macroeconomic outlook and the\nnine-month period was driven by the same\nfactors as well as a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure, partially\noffset by asset quality improvement and\nreduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption increased $ 4.9billion during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023\ndriven by consumer loans, which\nincreased $ 2.5billion driven by credit\ncard, partially offset by declines in\nsecurities-based lending. Commercial\nloans increased $ 2.4billion driven by\nbroad-based growth.

Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 17million and $\n34million net of hedges, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\ncompared to $ 5million and $ 35million for the same periods in 2022, are not\nincluded in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n93.5billion and $ 102.6billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 55million and $ 187million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $ 71million and $\n215million for the same periods in 2022. Servicing advances on serviced loans,\nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n1.3billion and $ 1.6billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans and leases in the\nconsolidated credit card trust included $ 3.6billion and $ 3.3billion of seller\u2019s\ninterest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n                                                                                  \n  81Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit Card and Automobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes\noriginated and purchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of\nfinancing. The loans are sold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The\nsecuritizations are ongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into\nthe trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third\nparties, depending on the securitization structure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing\ninvolvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables and\nholding various subordinated interests, including an undivided seller\u2019s interest\nin the credit card receivables and owning certain retained interests. At September\n30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $\n15.2billion and $ 14.0billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the\ncarrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party\ninvestors from the trusts totaled $ 6.2billion and $ 3.0billion, which are\nincluded in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation\nresecuritized $ 1.8billion and $ 7.6billion of securities during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $ 5.3billion and $ 19.5billion\nfor the same periods in 2022. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs\nwere measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making\nand similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or\nloss on sale was recorded. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023 and 2022, resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair\nvalue of $ 1.1billion and $ 2.1billion compared to $ 670million and $ 2.4billion,\nof which substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account\nassets for both periods. Substantially all of the trading account securities\ncarried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nMunicipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold\nhighly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing\nby issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other\nshort-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments\nto unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation\nwas transferor, totaled $ 2.0billion and $ 2.5billion at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts\nat September 30, 2023 was 12.3years. There were no significant write-downs or\ndowngrades of assets or issuers during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022.

The Corporation\u2019s\ninvolvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n832million and $ 914million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including\nthe notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net\nof losses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs. Total assets of the consolidated and unconsolidated\nVIEs were $ 1.5billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The Corporation\u2019s loss exposure is limited to its loan\nand debt security holdings and the notional amount of any derivatives to which the\nCorporation is a counterparty. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs and CLOs totaled $ 16.3billion at both\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which is insignificant to the total\nassets of the VIEs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \nInvestment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which\nmay be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that\nhold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are\ndesigned to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $ 471million and $ 854million.\nThe Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 15.4billion and $ 12.2billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 1.8billion and $ 2.4billion at September\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less\nnon-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.2billion at both September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail\ncars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The\nnet investment represents the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds equity investments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these\nunconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 81.7billion and $ 74.8billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. An unrelated third party is typically\nthe general partner or managing member and has control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments\nin these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax\nbenefits in the Corporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they\nare earned, which varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from\nenvironmental, social and governance investments in affordable housing are\nrecognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from renewable\nenergy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing\nInvestment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing\nProduction Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period. The\nvolume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount\nof tax credits recognized each period. The Corporation\u2019s equity investments in\naffordable housing and other projects totaled $ 14.9billion and $ 14.7billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which included unfunded capital\ncontributions of $ 6.8billion and $ 6.9billion and are probable to be paid over\nthe next five years. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to\nsupport a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have\nnot been and are not expected to be significant. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax\nbenefits related to affordable housing and other tax credit equity investments of\n$ 526million and $ 1.6billion compared to $ 457million and $ 1.3billion for the\nsame periods in 2022, and reported pretax losses in other income of $ 379million\nand $ 1.1billion compared to $ 350million and $ 1.0billion for the same periods in\n2022. The Corporation\u2019s equity investments in renewable energy totaled $\n13.9billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In addition, the\nCorporation had unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of\n$ 6.5billion and $ 1.9billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which\nare contingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two years.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring the\nproject to qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation\nrecognized tax credits and other tax benefits related to renewable energy equity\ninvestments of $ 1.3billion and $ 3.4billion compared to $ 527million and $\n2.0billion for the same periods in 2022 and reported pretax losses in other income\nof $ 849million and $ 2.0billion compared to $ 337million and $ 1.4billion for the\nsame periods in 2022.

by contract or practice\nto sell or repledge. At September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of this collateral was $\n852.7billion and $ 827.6billion, of\nwhich $ 820.9billion and $ 764.1billion\nwas sold or repledged. The primary\nsource of this collateral is securities\nborrowed or purchased under agreements\nto resell. For more information on\ncollateral, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term\nBorrowings, Collateral and Restricted\nCash to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Restricted\nCash At September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, the Corporation held\nrestricted cash included within cash and\ncash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 6.1billion and $\n7.6billion, predominantly related to\ncash segregated in compliance with\nsecurities regulations and cash held on\ndeposit with central banks to meet\nreserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nCredit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.6billion and $ 10.4billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. The carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s credit extension\ncommitments at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, excluding commitments\naccounted for under the fair value\noption, was $ 1.4billion and $\n1.6billion, which predominantly related\nto the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The carrying value of these\ncommitments is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Legally\nbinding commitments to extend credit\ngenerally have specified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of these commitments\nhave adverse change clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation against\ndeterioration in the borrower\u2019s ability\nto pay. The following table includes the\nnotional amount of commitments of $\n1.8billion and $ 3.0billion at September\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 62million and $\n110million at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, which is classified\nin accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 23.6billion and $\n9.8billion at September 30, 2023, and $ 25.1billion and $ 9.5billion at December\n31, 2022. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 714million and $\n575million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 788million and $ 636million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 452million and $ 294million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCorporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $ 128.3billion and $ 92.0billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 73.2billion and $ 57.8billion. A significant portion of these\ncommitments will expire within the next 12months. At September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to\n$ 4.0billion and $ 3.7billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and\nleases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and\ncan be terminated with 12months prior notice. At September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $\n900million and $ 571million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is\nrequired to subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve\ndistrict bank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation paid $ 5.4billion for\nhalf of its subscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the\nFederal Reserve district bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote.\nOther Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation\nsells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer\ngroup life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At both September\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $\n4.3billion. At both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 632million, with estimated\nmaturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its\nrole as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held\nliable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due\nto, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly\nreversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or\nmerchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges.\nThe ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 412billion, is an estimate\nof the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of September 30, 2023. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a\ncardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation\nmitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or\nother types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for\ncontingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing\nactivity were not significant.\n                                                                                  \n  87Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nRepresentations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees For\nmore information on representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 621million and $\n612million at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and\nthe related provision is included in\nother income in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The representations\nand warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of probable\nincurred losses, is based on its\nexperience in previous negotiations, and\nis subject to judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations\nand warranties losses may occur in\nexcess of the amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does\nnot expect such amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's financial condition\nand liquidity. See Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible\nloss in excess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 43.6billion and $ 59.6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. Other Guarantees In the normal\ncourse of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations\nof its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related\ntransactions and non-ISDA related\ntransactions such as commodities\ntrading, repurchase agreements, prime\nbrokerage agreements and other\ntransactions. Guarantees of Certain\nLong-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory\ntrust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the\nCorporation. Other Contingencies On May\n11, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) issued a proposed\nrule that would impose a special\n\nassessment to recover the loss to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund arising from the\nprotection of uninsured depositors of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank\nassociated with their closures, and the\nsystemic risk determination announced by\nthe FDIC on March 12, 2023. While the\ntiming and amount of any expense\nrecognition are unknown until the\nproposed rule is finalized, if the final\nrule is issued as proposed, the\nestimated impact of the special\nassessment on the Corporation would be a\nnoninterest expense of approximately $\n1.9billion that would be recognized upon\nfinalization of the rule, which could\noccur in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n76million and $ 442million was\nrecognized for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 compared to $\n507million and $ 1.1billion for the same\nperiods in 2022. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nfor which a loss in future periods is\nreasonably possible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued\nliability) and for representations and\nwarranties exposures, the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 0.8billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. The accrued\nliability and estimated range of\npossible loss are based upon currently\navailable information and subject to\nsignificant judgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and unknown\nuncertainties. The matters underlying\nthe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are unpredictable\nand may change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly\nfrom the current estimate and accrual.\nThe estimated range of possible loss\ndoes not represent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure. Information is\nprovided below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the litigation\nand, where specified, associated claimed\ndamages.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nBased on current knowledge, and taking\ninto account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nbelow and in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of those matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthose matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Deposit Insurance\nAssessment On April 10, 2023, the\nmagistrate judge issued a report and\nrecommendation (the Report) for\nresolving the parties\u2019 pending summary\njudgment motions. The Report recommends\ngranting the FDIC motion for summary\njudgment on BANA\u2019s statutory liability\nfor the unpaid assessments, subject to\nBANA\u2019s statute of limitations defenses\nto assessments for the quarters ended\nMarch 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013,\non which the Report recommends that\nrelevant issues should be resolved at\ntrial. The Report also recommends\ndenying BANA\u2019s counterclaims challenging\nthe adoption of the relevant assessment\nregulations and granting BANA\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment on the FDIC\u2019s\nclaims for unjust enrichment and\ndisgorgement. The Report has been\nsubmitted to the district court judge\nfor consideration, and the parties have\nfiled objections to the recommendations\nin the Report. Representment Non-\nsufficient Fund Fees On July 11, 2023,\nit was announced that BANA agreed to\nsettle twoseparate proceedings with the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) and Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) related to\nBANA\u2019s assessing overdraft or\ninsufficient funds fees each time a\nmerchant resubmitted a transaction or\ncheck for payment after it had been\ndeclined due to insufficient funds\n(Representment Fees). Without admitting\nor denying the findings, BANA consented\nto orders requiring it to pay penalties\nof $ 60million to each of the OCC and\nCFPB. Under the CFPB Consent Order,\namong other things, BANA also consented\nto refund at least $ 80million to\ncustomers who were assessed\nRepresentment Fees between September 1,\n2018 to February 18, 2022. Credit Card\nSales and Marketing Practices On July\n11, 2023, it was announced that BANA\nagreed to a settlement with the CFPB\nrelated to online advertisements\nconcerning bonuses linked to rewards\ncredit cards and failure to provide\nthose bonuses to certain consumers, and\napplying for and opening credit cards\nfor consumers without their consent and\nobtaining credit reports for those\nconsumers. Without admitting or denying\nthe findings, BANA agreed to the entry\nof a Consent Order requiring payment of\na $ 30million penalty and certain\nundertakings concerning consumer\nredress.\n\nUnemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards\nBANA has been named as a defendant in a\nnumber of putative class action, mass\naction, and individual lawsuits in\nmultiple states related to its\nadministration of prepaid debit cards to\ndistribute unemployment and other state\nbenefits. These lawsuits generally\nassert claims for monetary damages and\ninjunctive relief. Class action and mass\naction lawsuits related to the\nCalifornia program, the largest program\nadministered by BANA measured by total\nbenefits and number of participants,\nhave been consolidated into a\nmultidistrict litigation (MDL) in the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California.

transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the\nmeasurement date. The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if\nthe significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent\nmarketplace. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, there were no\nchanges to valuation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are expected to\nhave, a material impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations. For\nmore information regarding the fair\nvalue hierarchy, how the Corporation\nmeasures fair value and valuation\ntechniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The Corporation accounts for\ncertain financial instruments under the\nfair value option.
