 \u201cFRB\u201d), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation      \n  (the \u201cFDIC\u201d), and the Office of the Comptroller of     \n  the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d, and together with the FRB     \n  and the FDIC, the \u201cBanking Agencies\u201d) announced that   \n  the temporary change to the supplementary leverage     \n  ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d) for bank holding companies and           \n  depository institutions issued in 2020 will expire as  \n  scheduled on March\u00a031, 2021.As of December\u00a031, 2020,   \n  Bank of America Corporation (\u201cBank of America\u201d or the  \n  \u201cCompany\u201d) reported an SLR of 7.2%; excluding the      \n  temporary change, the SLR would have been              \n  approximately 6.2%, which is 1.2%, or $39\u00a0billion, in  \n  excess of the 5% SLR regulatory minimum required for   \n  the Company by the FRB. The Company\u2019s lead depository  \n  institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to     \n  take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the        \n  OCC.The SLR ratio has historically not been a          \n  constraint for Bank of America as the Company has      \n  remained above the minimum ratio since its             \n  establishment by the Banking Agencies.\u00a0Bank of         \n  America does not expect the expiration of the          \n  temporary relief announced today to affect the         \n  Company\u2019s ability to service customers or constrain    \n  the Company\u2019s capital return plans to                  \n  shareholders.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain         \n  statements contained in this Current Report on         \n  Form8-Kmay constitute \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements     \n  within the meaning of the Private Securities           \n  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking\u00a0  \n  statements represent the current expectations, plans   \n  or forecasts of Bank of America based on available     \n  information.\u00a0Forward-looking\u00a0statements can be         \n  identified by the fact that they do not relate         \n  strictly to historical or current facts.

Actual outcomes and results may     \n  differ materially from those expressed in, or implied  \n  by, any forward-looking\u00a0statements.
