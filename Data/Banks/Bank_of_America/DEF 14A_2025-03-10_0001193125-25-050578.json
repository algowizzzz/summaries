To \ncarry out its responsibilities and set the tone at the top, the Board regularly   \nreviews its composition, and through its Corporate Governance Committee,          \nidentifies and recommends director candidates for nomination using a director     \nselection process that has been reviewed with our primary bank regulators. The    \nBoard, in coordination with its committees, also regularly considers Board        \nleadership, succession planning, and committee membership composition. Board      \ncomposition Our Board believes directors should possess high personal integrity   \nand character, demonstrated management and leadership ability, extensive          \nexperience within our industry and across sectors, and the ability to exercise    \nsound and independent judgment in a collegial manner. Our Board:                  \n                                                                                  \n       seeks directors whose complementary knowledge, experience, and skills      \n  \u2022    provide a broad range of perspectives and leadership expertise in areas    \n       important to our company\u2019s strategy and oversight                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       assesses directors\u2019 age and tenure to provide for continuity in the        \n  \u2022    boardroom and to achieve a balance between the perspectives of newer       \n       directors and those of longer-serving directors                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    evaluates whether directors are able to devote the time necessary to       \n       discharge their duties                                                     \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, the Corporate Governance Committee follows applicable regulations in \nconfirming that our Board includes members who are independent, possess financial \nliteracy and expertise, understand risk management principles, policies, and      \npractices, and have experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk       \nexposures. Key considerations informing the Board\u2019s approach Director experience, \nskills, and expertise.When evaluating and identifying director candidates, the    \nCorporate Governance Committee considers the experiences, skills, and expertise   \nthat are critical to the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of the    \ncompany and are directly relevant to our business, strategy, and operations. The  \nCommittee seeks candidates with experiences, skills, and expertise in financial   \nservices and other global, highly complex and regulated industries, strategic     \nplanning and business development, business operations, marketing and             \ndistribution, technology, cybersecurity, risk management and financial reporting, \nhuman capital management, corporate governance, and public policy. Our Board views\nits diverse composition across a range of dimensions, including experiences,      \nskills, backgrounds, perspectives, and tenure, as a priority. Through the         \nCorporate Governance Committee, the Board regularly assesses its composition and  \nseeks representation across a range of attributes when identifying and evaluating \ndirector candidates. The Committee requests its third-party search firms to       \ninclude a variety of candidates in its consideration of potential directors. (See \ninformation on the next page for the Committee\u2019s engagement with external search  \nfirms.) When evaluating director candidates, the Committee reviews available      \ninformation regarding each candidate, including, but not limited to, professional \nqualifications, experience, skills, expertise, references, backgrounds, and       \nperspectives in the context of the Board\u2019s overall composition and our company\u2019s  \nstrategy. Director time commitment.Our Board understands the time commitment      \ninvolved in serving on the Board and its committees. Through the Committee, the   \nBoard regularly evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able to    \ndevote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors, taking into     \naccount their primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other         \nresponsibilities. In 2022, at the Committee\u2019s recommendation, our Board amended   \nits policy on outside board service set forth in the Corporate Governance         \nGuidelines. The revised policy limits the maximum number of public company boards \non which a director on our Board may serve to four public companies (including our\nBoard) and specifies that any public company chief executive officer who serves as\na director on our Board may not serve on the boards of more than two public       \ncompanies (including our Board).                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                               The Committee      \n                                                               assesses           \n                                                               directors\u2019 time    \n                                                               commitment to the  \n                                                               Board throughout   \n                                                               the year,          \n                                                               including through  \n                                                               the annual formal  \n                                                               self-evaluation    \n                                                               process and prior  \n                                                               to the annual      \n                                                               renomination of    \n                                                               currently serving  \n                                                               directors.

                                           \nDirector independence The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards require\na majority of our directors and each member of our Audit Committee, Compensation  \nand Human Capital Committee, and Corporate Governance Committee to be independent.\nThe Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Enhanced Prudential Standards require the chair of our\nEnterprise Risk Committee to be independent. In addition, our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines require a substantial majority of our directors to be independent. Our \nBoard has adopted Director Independence Categorical Standards (Categorical        \nStandards) as an annex to our Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist it in     \ndetermining each director\u2019s independence. Our Board considers directors and       \ndirector nominees \u201cindependent\u201d if they meet the criteria for independence in both\nthe NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards. In early 2025, our      \nBoard, in coordination with our Corporate Governance Committee, evaluated the     \nrelevant relationships between each director or director nominee (and immediate   \nfamily members and affiliates) and Bank of America Corporation and its            \nsubsidiaries, and affirmatively determined that all of our directors and director \nnominees are independent, except for Mr. Moynihan due to his employment by our    \ncompany. Specifically, the following directors and director nominees are          \nindependent under the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards: Ms.   \nAllen, Mr. Almeida, Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Ms. Hudson, Ms. Martinez, Ms. Lozano,\nMr. Nowell, Ms. Ramos, Dr. Rose, Mr. White, Mr. Woods, and Dr. Zuber. In making   \nits independence determinations, our Board considered the following ordinary      \ncourse, non-preferentialrelationships that existed during the preceding three     \nyears and those applicable transactions reported under \u201cRelated person and certain\nother transactions\u201d on page 41, and determined that none of the relationships for \nthe directors and director nominees set forth below constituted a material        \nrelationship between the director or director nominee and our company:            \n                                                                                  \n       Our company or its subsidiaries provided ordinary course financial         \n       products and services to all of our directors and director nominees, some  \n       of their immediate family members, and entities affiliated with some of    \n       them or their immediate family members (Mr.\u00a0Almeida, Mr.\u00a0de Weck, and Dr.  \n  \u2022    Rose). In each case, the fees we received for these products and services  \n       were below the thresholds of the NYSE listing standards and our            \n       Categorical Standards, and, where applicable, were less than 2% of the     \n       consolidated gross annual revenues of our company and of the other         \n       entity.                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our company or its subsidiaries purchased products or services in the      \n       ordinary course from entities where some of our directors and director     \n       nominees are executive officers or employees or their immediate family     \n  \u2022    members serve or served in the past three years as executive officers      \n       (Mr.\u00a0Almeida, Mr.\u00a0Donald, Ms. Martinez, Dr.\u00a0Rose, and Mr.\u00a0Woods). In each  \n       case, the fees paid to each of these entities were below the thresholds    \n       of the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards.               \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  24    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nIndependent board leadership Our Board is committed to objective, independent     \nBoard leadership. It believes that independent board oversight involves not only  \nhaving a properly defined independent board leader, such as a strong Lead         \nIndependent Director when the Chair is the CEO, but also having robust governance \nstructures that promote active oversight. Our Board embraces multiple, interlinked\npractices that support the Board\u2019s effective functioning as a whole and engender  \nstrong and objective Board oversight. These practices include:                    \n                                                                                  \n       Regular reviews of our Board leadership structure and governance           \n  \u2022    practices, taking into account contemporaneous shareholder and             \n       stakeholder perspectives;                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A robust, well-defined, and transparent Lead Independent Director          \n       structure that applies when our Chair is not an independent director and   \n       empowers the Lead Independent Director with extensive authority and        \n  \u2022    responsibilities. The Lead Independent Director\u2019s comprehensive authority  \n       and responsibilities are formalized in our Corporate Governance            \n       Guidelines and regularly reviewed. They give our Lead Independent          \n       Director significant authority with respect to the operation and           \n       functioning of the Board as well as direct engagement with stakeholders;   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Active leadership, involvement, and influence by the Lead Independent      \n       Director. The Lead Independent Director regularly convenes and presides    \n       over executive sessions of our independent directors outside the presence  \n       of management and our CEO, and develops topics for discussion during       \n  \u2022    these closed sessions. In addition, the Lead Independent Director speaks   \n       individually with each Board member at least quarterly, meets with our     \n       CEO at least monthly and with other members of management regularly, has   \n       regular calls with our primary bank regulators, and plays a central role   \n       in overseeing and participating in shareholder engagement efforts;         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A Board composed of experienced and skilled directors, all of whom stand   \n       for election annually and all of whom are independent aside from the CEO.  \n       Each standing committee of the Board is presided over by an independent    \n  \u2022    chair and is composed entirely of independent directors. Under this        \n       approach, independent directors are empowered and entrusted with           \n       oversight of critical issues that are within the purview of these          \n       committees; and                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A robust Board and committee formal self-evaluation process and            \n  \u2022    thoughtful director succession practices as described on pages\u00a027 to 28    \n       and 7 to 8, respectively, of this proxy statement.                         \n                                                                                  \nWe believe these practices, coupled with our Board\u2019s other governance processes,  \nprovide for strong, independent Board leadership and effective engagement with,   \nand oversight of, management. Our Board leadership structure Our Bylaws provide   \nthat our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board leadership structure    \nbest suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and our Board. This     \nBylaw provision was ratified by our shareholders at a 2015 special meeting called \nsolely for that purpose. Our shareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing   \nthis flexibility by voting against shareholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments \nrequiring an independent Chair at each of our 2017, 2018, 2023, and 2024 annual   \nmeetings of shareholders. At least annually, our Board, in coordination with our  \nCorporate Governance Committee, deliberates on and discusses the appropriate Board\nleadership structure, including the considerations described above. Our Board\u2019s   \noptimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company\u2019s        \nevolving needs, strategy, and the operating environment; changes in our Board\u2019s   \ncomposition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of\nshareholders and other stakeholders. The Board evaluates the Board\u2019s leadership   \nstructure at least annually to determine what, if any, changes are appropriate    \nbased on the then-existing needs and circumstances of our company and our Board   \nand input from shareholders and other stakeholders. If at any time the Board\u2019s    \nreview of its leadership structure resulted in the conclusion that an independent \nChair would best serve the interests of our shareholders based on the company\u2019s   \nneeds and circumstances at that time, the Board would appoint an independent      \nChair. Under our Board\u2019s current leadership structure, we have a Chair and a Lead \nIndependent Director. Our Board, through its annual assessment, with input from   \nshareholders, believes that the existing structure continues to be the optimal    \nleadership framework at this time. Our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell,     \nexemplifies objective, independent Board leadership and effectively engages with  \nand oversees management. Mr. Nowell leads the other independent directors in      \nproviding objective oversight of management, reviewing the CEO\u2019s performance,     \ndetermining and approving CEO compensation, helping to establish our company\u2019s    \nlong-term strategy and regularly assessing its effectiveness, and serving the best\ninterests of our company and our shareholders by overseeing management\u2019s work to  \ncreate long-term value. He is joined by our Chair, Mr. Moynihan, who, as CEO,     \nserves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term strategy and Responsible  \nGrowth. Mr. Moynihan brings deep leadership experience in and knowledge of the    \nfinancial services industry, our company, its businesses, and our focus on        \nResponsible Growth. He is a global leader who serves as chair of the Sustainable  \nMarkets Initiative, on the board of Bank Policy Institute, and as a member of the \nWorld Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) International Business Council, the Business         \nRoundtable, and the Financial Service Forum.                                      \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    25  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nEmpowered and highly-engaged Lead Independent Director Our Lead Independent       \nDirector, Mr. Nowell, is empowered with and exercises robust, well-defined duties \nformalized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

Board evaluation Our Board and our Board committees         \nregularly evaluate their own effectiveness through a comprehensive and            \nmultifaceted process. This process has two complementary components: an ongoing,  \nyear-round component and a formal, annual component. The ongoing year-round       \ncomponent of the process allows directors to provide real-time input and response.\nThe formal annual component, developed and administered under the direction of the\nCorporate Governance Committee, assesses the Board\u2019s effectiveness against        \ncharacteristics frequently identified with highly effective boards (see next      \npage). The Committee annually examines the areas of focus for the self-evaluation \nand reviews industry trends, practices of peers, investors\u2019 views, and regulatory \ndevelopments related to board and committee self-evaluations and determines the   \nscope and format of the Board\u2019s formal self-evaluation.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                           Annual self-evaluation \u00a0 DETERMINE     \n                                           FOCUS AREAS, SCOPE, AND FORMAT The     \n                                           formal self-evaluation may be in the   \n                                           form of written and/or oral            \n                                           questionnaires administered by Board   \n                                           members, management, or third          \n                                           parties.

The Board\u2019s formal annual self-evaluation is organized around these five   \ncategories. Through the self-evaluation process:                                  \n                                                      \n  Composition. Our Board identifies qualities,        \n  relevant skills, and experiences of potential       \n  director candidates that are consistent with the    \n  company\u2019s current strategy and Responsible Growth,  \n  and that allow the Board to effectively perform     \n  its risk oversight responsibilities. Our Board      \n  also assesses its optimal size.                     \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Board culture. Our Board considers its role in      \n  setting the standard for the company\u2019s culture and  \n  values, including by evaluating interactions among  \n  directors and with members of management.           \n  Directors assess how the Board\u2019s culture            \n  encourages candor and participation by all          \n  directors. Directors also assess how they interact  \n  with management, including the ability to           \n  communicate expectations and concerns to            \n  management.                                         \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Focus. Our Board and committees consider their      \n  effectiveness in performing key oversight           \n  responsibilities in a number of areas, including    \n  the company\u2019s culture and values, strategy, risk,   \n  Responsible Growth, and management talent and       \n  succession planning. They evaluate the time spent   \n  in these areas and provide input on additional      \n  information and resources desired to support their  \n  oversight responsibilities. Directors also          \n  regularly reassess their oversight focus by         \n  engaging in dialogue with management, soliciting    \n  input from shareholders and other stakeholders,     \n  and receiving third-party perspectives on the       \n  competitive environment, opportunities for growth,  \n  macroeconomic trends, and geopolitics.              \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Process. Directors review overall Board and         \n  committee structure, the allocation of meeting      \n  time, cadence of meetings, and other meeting        \n  processes. Directors also provide input on process  \n  enhancements to allow ample time during meetings    \n  for discussion, debate, and in-depth review of      \n  strategic topics.                                   \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Information and resources. Our Board and            \n  committees assess the quality of meeting materials  \n  and presentations and the overall amount and type   \n  of information, education, and training             \n  opportunities they receive both from management     \n  and outside advisors and experts. Our directors     \n  continue to highlight the need for clear,           \n  comprehensive, and concise information.             \n                                                      \nEnhancements made in response to year-round and annual Board self-evaluations Our \ndirectors and management work together to respond to the Board and committees\u2019    \nself-evaluation results. In response to the formal and informal components of the \nBoard\u2019s self-evaluation processes in 2024, we have:                               \n                                                                                  \n                               Enhanced the Board\u2019s technology expertise through  \n  Composition                  the addition of a new director and continued to    \n                               support Board succession planning and respond to   \n                               input on desired Board composition.                \n                               Continued to provide opportunities for our Board   \n                               to interact with senior management and emerging    \n  Board culture                talent, both formally and informally, to           \n                               strengthen relationships and support the Board\u2019s   \n                               talent and succession planning responsibilities.   \n                               Provided deep dives during the Board\u2019s strategic   \n                               planning session and other Board meetings on       \n                               topics requested by directors, including key       \n                               competitor analysis and artificial intelligence.   \n                               Management also provided one-on-one meetings with  \n                               directors to discuss regulatory matters.

The \nBoard encourages directors to participate annually in external continuing director\neducation programs, and our company reimburses directors for their expenses       \nassociated with this participation. Our directors also attend forums and          \nconferences convened by our primary banking regulators. Continuing director       \neducation is also provided during Board and committee meetings and other          \ndiscussions as part of the formal meetings and as stand-alone information sessions\noutside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2024, our Board heard from our    \nprimary banking regulators, outside legal counsel, and an expert on the Executive \nBranch of the federal government, and from management on numerous subjects,       \nincluding generative artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, technology, the      \nmacroeconomic environment, risk management, climate strategy and sustainable      \nfinance, and human capital management. All new directors also participate in our  \ndirector orientation program during their first six months on our Board. New      \ndirectors have a series of meetings over time with management representatives from\nall of our business and staff areas to review and discuss, with increasing detail,\ninformation about our company, industry, and regulatory framework, as well as     \ncompliance training. Based on input from our directors, we believe this gradual   \non-boardingapproach over the first six months of Board service, coupled with      \nparticipation in regular Board and committee meetings, provides new directors with\na strong foundation in our company\u2019s businesses, connects directors with members  \nof management with whom they will interact and oversee, and accelerates their     \neffectiveness to engage fully in Board deliberations. Directors have access to    \nadditional orientation and educational opportunities upon acceptance of new or    \nadditional responsibilities on the Board and in committees. CEO and senior        \nmanagement succession planning Our Board oversees CEO and senior management       \nsuccession planning, which is formally reviewed at least annually. Two such       \nplanning sessions were held in 2024. Our CEO and our Chief People Officer provide \nour Board with recommendations and evaluations of potential CEO successors, and   \nreview their development progress. Our Board reviews potential internal senior    \nmanagement candidates with our CEO and our Chief People Officer, including the    \nqualifications, experience, and development priorities for these individuals.     \nDirectors engage with potential CEO and senior management successors at Board and \ncommittee meetings and in less formal settings to allow directors to personally   \nassess candidates. Further, our Board periodically reviews the overall composition\nof our senior management\u2019s qualifications, tenure, and experience. Our Board also \nestablishes steps to address emergency CEO succession planning in extraordinary   \ncircumstances. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our    \ncompany to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting    \nfrom a major catastrophe, by continuing our company\u2019s safe and sound operation and\nminimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our company\u2019s business   \nand operations. Board meetings and attendance Directors are expected to attend our\nannual meetings of shareholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each of our \nincumbent directors and nominees, aside from Ms. Martinez who did not serve as a  \ndirector in 2024, attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of our Board and\nthe committees on which they served during 2024. In addition, all of the directors\nserving on our Board at the time of our 2024 annual meeting attended the meeting. \nOur independent directors regularly meet privately in executive session without   \nour Chair and CEO or other members of management present, and held 13 such        \nexecutive sessions in connection with Board meetings in 2024. Our Lead Independent\nDirector leads these Board executive sessions.                                    \n                                                                                  \n       The number of formal Board meetings reflected includes the Board\u2019s         \n  (1)  standalone risk oversight meetings. In addition to the number of formal    \n       meetings reflected, from time to time, the Board also held informational   \n       sessions.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    29  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nCommittees and membership Our Board has four committees. Charters describing the  \nresponsibilities of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee, Corporate Governance Committee, and Enterprise Risk Committee can be   \nfound at http://investor.bankofamerica.com, and their membership is set forth     \nbelow. Our Board committees regularly make recommendations and report on their    \nactivities to the entire Board. Each committee may obtain advice from internal or \nexternal financial, legal, accounting, or other advisors at their discretion. Our \nBoard, in considering the recommendations of our Corporate Governance Committee,  \nreviews our committee charters and committee membership at least annually. In     \n2025, the Board, with input from the Corporate Governance Committee, reassessed   \nthe committees\u2019 membership in consideration of Ms. Martinez\u2019s appointment to the  \nBoard. Also in 2025, the Board changed the Committee\u2019s name, following            \nrecommendation by the Committee. The Committee benchmarked the naming conventions \nof similar committees at peers and other large U.S. corporations, and concluded   \nthat its prior name, Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, was \nrepetitive and did not reflect the Committee\u2019s spectrum of responsibilities. The  \nBoard did not otherwise change the Committee\u2019s charter or oversight               \nresponsibilities.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                     Audit Committee                           No. of meetings    \n                                                               in 2024: 14        \n                                         Key                                      \n                                         responsibilities \u2022                       \n                                         Oversees the                             \n                                         qualifications,                          \n                                         performance,                             \n                                         independence, and                        \n                                         appointment of our                       \n                                         company\u2019s             Independence /     \n                                         independent           qualifications     \n                                         registered public     All members are    \n                                         accounting firm \u00a0     independent under  \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u2009Oversees the       the NYSE listing   \n                                         performance of our    standards and our  \n                                         company\u2019s             Categorical        \n                                         corporate audit       Standards and the  \n  Members Sharon L.                      function \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        heightened         \n  Allen (Chair)                          Oversees the          independence       \n  Jos\u00e9                                   integrity of our      requirements       \n  (Joe) E.

The Board, which includes members with technology and         \ncybersecurity experience, oversees management\u2019s approach to staffing, policies,   \nprocesses, and practices to address cybersecurity risk. The Board and the         \nEnterprise Risk Committee, which is responsible for reviewing cybersecurity risk, \neach receive regular presentations, memoranda, and reports throughout the year    \nfrom our Chief Technology and Information Officer and our Chief Information       \nSecurity Officer on internal and external cybersecurity developments, threats, and\nrisks. On a quarterly basis, GIS sends the Board a memorandum highlighting        \nrelevant cybersecurity developments and a document detailing the performance      \nmetrics for the GIS Program. Under the Board\u2019s oversight, management works closely\nwith key stakeholders, including regulators, government agencies, law enforcement,\npeer institutions and industry groups, and develops and invests in talent and     \ninnovative technology in order to better manage cybersecurity risk. Employees     \nacross the company also play a role in protecting the company from cybersecurity  \nthreats and receive periodic training and education on cybersecurity-related      \ntopics.

The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance;  \n(ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory        \ndevelopments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the      \nCommittee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation    \nstatement, or \u201ctally sheet,\u201d for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect \neach executive officer\u2019s total compensation, including base salary, cash, and     \nequity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards    \n(including the status of achieving any performance goals), qualified and          \nnonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit accruals, and the       \nincremental cost to our company of the executive\u2019s perquisites. The Committee uses\nthis information to evaluate all elements of compensation and benefits provided to\nan executive officer. The Committee also annually reviews market pay practices,   \nincluding compensation benchmarks at our primary competitor group, to evaluate    \nmarket trends and competitive pay levels for our executive officers. For          \nadditional information, see \u201c2024 Competitor group\u201d section on page 64. Annually, \nthe Committee reviews with our Board its compensation decisions (including cash   \nand equity-based incentive awards, if applicable) for executives who report       \ndirectly to our CEO. With respect to the CEO\u2019s compensation, the Committee makes a\nrecommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of\nthe Board. The CEO does not participate in Committee or Board deliberations about \nhis compensation. Additionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit        \nExecutive, the Committee\u2019s pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved  \nby our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.       \nExecutive officers do not engage with the Committee in setting the amount of their\nown individual compensation. During annual performance reviews for executive      \nofficers other than our CEO, the Committee considers our CEO\u2019s perspective and    \nincentive award recommendations before approving compensation for each of these   \nexecutive officers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our   \nvarious lines of business, business segments, and functions, as well as           \nperformance feedback from our Chief People Officer and our independent control    \nfunctions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, and    \nLegal). The Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its charter \nto approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for those    \nservices. In 2024, the Committee retained a new consultant, Semler Brossy, as its \nindependent compensation consultant. Semler Brossy\u2019s business with us is limited  \nto providing independent executive and director compensation consulting services. \nSemler Brossy does not provide any other services to our company. For 2024, Semler\nBrossy provided the Committee external market and performance comparisons,        \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    33  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nadvised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director compensation,        \nassisted in evaluating compensation program design, and assisted with other       \nexecutive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services,\nSemler Brossy met regularly with the Committee without management and privately   \nwith the Chair of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to management certain \nduties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee    \ndelegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation   \nCommittee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO  \nand his direct reports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee      \nsubstantially all of our employee benefit plans. See \u201cCompensation governance     \nstructure\u201d below. Compensation risk management policies and practices Our         \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee is committed to a compensation governance\nstructure that effectively contributes to our company\u2019s overall risk management   \npolicies. Compensation Governance Policy. The Committee has adopted and annually  \nreviews our Compensation Governance Policy, which governs our incentive           \ncompensation decisions and defines the framework for oversight of enterprise-wide \nincentive compensation program design. Consistent with global regulatory          \ninitiatives, our Compensation Governance Policy requires that our incentive       \ncompensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking.                        \n                                                                                  \n                            Our Compensation                                      \n                            Governance Policy                                     \n                            addresses...                                          \n  \u2022 Definition and process                                                        \n  for identifying                                      \u2022\u2002\u2009Policies on incentive   \n  \u201crisk-taking\u201d employees                              compensation plan          \n  \u2022 Key goals and                                      effectiveness through      \n  process for incentive                                testing and monitoring to  \n  compensation plan                                    confirm that the plans     \n  design and governance to                             appropriately balance      \n  appropriately                                        risks with compensation    \n  balance risks with                                   outcomes, including        \n  compensation                                         developing processes to    \n  outcomes, including:                                 administer cancellations   \n  \u2022 funding incentive                                  and clawbacks \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        \n  compensation pools \u2022                                 Policies that provide for  \n  determining individual                               the independence of our    \n  incentive                                            company\u2019s independent      \n  compensation awards \u2022                                control functions and      \n  use of discretion                                    their appropriate input    \n  as part of those                                     to the Committee           \n  processes                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nCompensation governance structure. Our compensation governance structure allocates\nresponsibility so that our Board, Compensation and Human Capital Committee, or the\nappropriate management-level governing body makes compensation decisions with     \ndocumented input from the independent control functions. This approach promotes   \neffective oversight and review and facilitates the appropriate governance to      \nbalance risk and reward. Below is an illustration of our compensation governance  \nstructure, which is influenced by internal considerations and external factors:   \nIncentive plan certification process. Pursuant to our Compensation Governance     \nPolicy, our annual incentive plan certification and review process provides for a \ncomprehensive review, analysis, and discussion of incentive design and operation. \nAs part of the governance for incentive plans, each of the CEO\u2019s direct reports   \nwho is responsible for an incentive plan, along with their management teams and   \nindependent control functions (including their respective risk officers), meet    \nperiodically to discuss how business strategy, performance, and risk align to     \ncompensation. The relevant participants certify that the incentive programs they  \nreview: (i) are aligned with the applicable lines of business and our company\u2019s   \nbusiness strategy and performance objectives; (ii) do not encourage excessive or  \nimprudent risk-taking beyond our company\u2019s ability to effectively identify and    \nmanage risk; (iii) are compatible with effective controls and risk management; and\n(iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary trading. Our Chief Risk Officer \nalso certifies all incentive plans across our company as part of the Management   \nCompensation Committee\u2019s governance process. Semler Brossy and the Compensation   \nand Human Capital Committee review these management certifications.               \n                         \n  34    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nIncentive plan audit reviews. Corporate Audit annually reviews the operational    \neffectiveness of the incentive compensation program, using a risk-based approach  \nto evaluate plan design, pay execution, program governance, and conformity with   \nregulatory requirements. Conduct reviews. As part of our compensation governance  \npractices, management reviews the results of the conduct review process so that   \nconduct is consistently and appropriately considered in performance assessments   \nand pay decisions across the company. These performance and pay outcomes are      \nreviewed at least annually by the Committee. Independent control function         \nfeedback. In addition to reviewing the individual incentive compensation awards   \nfor executive officers and other senior executives who report directly to the CEO,\nthe Committee also reviews the outcomes of our control function feedback process  \nand individual incentive compensation awards for certain highly compensated       \nemployees. As part of its governance process, the Committee meets with the heads  \nof our independent control functions and business lines to discuss their feedback \non the pay-for-performanceprocess, including how risk management and conduct      \nmatters were factored into compensation decisions. These processes and reviews, in\ncombination with risk management and clawback features, are key components of our \ncompensation programs. These programs are designed to appropriately hold employees\naccountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a way that does not encourage   \nexcessive or imprudent risk-taking or create risks that are reasonably likely to  \nhave a material adverse effect on our company. Hedging policy. Under our Code of  \nConduct and other policies, all Bank of America directors, executive officers, and\ncertain other designated insiders are prohibited from hedging, speculative        \ntrading, or trading in derivative securities with respect to Bank of America      \nsecurities. They may not engage in short sales and trading in puts, calls, prepaid\nvariable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or exchange funds, and other   \noptions or derivatives with respect to our securities. All other employees may not\nengage in any such transactions other than transactions that hedge against an     \nexisting long position in our securities if the shares underlying the position are\nreadily available for sale or delivery. No employee may hedge the value of        \noutstanding restricted stock units or other equity-based awards, and such awards  \nmay be forfeited or recouped for violation of our anti-hedging and derivative     \ntransactions policies.

For Responsible Growth  \nto be sustainable, we must share our success with the communities in which we work\nand live. We do this in numerous ways. We help provide economic opportunities for \npeople and communities through access to lending and capital for homeowners,      \nbusiness owners, and entrepreneurs. Through our philanthropic partnerships, we    \nfocus on improving the lives of individuals and families by investing in basic    \nneeds, such as healthcare and hunger relief, workforce development, and education,\nwhile also strengthening broader community vitality by addressing needs related to\naffordable housing, small businesses, and neighborhood revitalization. How we     \nshare success with our communities is dynamic and multifaceted. See our 2024      \nAnnual Report for more information. Working with our clients to support and       \nfinance their sustainability goals. One of the ways we drive Responsible Growth is\nthrough our work to serve our clients\u2019 financial needs, including those clients   \nhelping deliver more secure, affordable, and sustainable energy. In 2021, we set a\n10-year goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion of sustainable finance by 2030, \n$1 trillion of which is dedicated toward the environmental transition. We believe \nthere is a business opportunity in assisting our clients with their sustainability\ngoals. To meet demand and capture this opportunity, our bankers engage with       \nconsumers and companies, deepening relationships with our existing clients,       \nbuilding relationships with new clients in the innovative clean energy sector, and\ndeploying our full suite of financial solutions to meet clients\u2019 needs as they    \ntake steps to transition to a more sustainable future. We use risk identification,\nmeasurement, and monitoring tools to drive policies, processes, and testing       \nefforts to manage and mitigate exposure to climate-related risks. We have         \nincorporated climate considerations into our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite     \nStatement and developed an internal Climate Risk Framework to address various     \nglobal climate-related laws, rules, regulations, and guidance. We conduct enhanced\ndue diligence and take additional measures to identify, evaluate, and mitigate    \nenvironmental risks for certain clients, business activities, industries, sectors,\nand geographies through a client- and deal-specific process that considers        \nportfolio-level credit, operational, reputational, and other risks, including     \nclimate risk. Our approach to managing client-related opportunities and risks is  \nembedded in our three-pronged climate strategy. We overlay these strategies with  \ntransparent and regular disclosures about our climate goals and progress,         \nincluding in our Sustainability at Bank of America document and our Environmental \nand Social Risk Policy Framework. See our Sustainability at Bank of America       \ndocument, our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework, and our 2024 Annual \nReport for more information. Being a great place to work Bank of America has      \nalways been the bank of opportunity, for our shareholders, our clients and        \ncustomers, our communities, and our teammates. We strive to make Bank of America a\ngreat place to work for our teammates by providing access to a broad range of     \nopportunities to achieve their professional goals and by maintaining a culture of \ncaring for them and their families. We are a company of approximately 213,000     \ntalented employees who represent a diverse range of experiences, skills,          \nbackgrounds, and perspectives across many dimensions. We are deliberate about the \nmany ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the       \nopportunity to achieve their career goals. This is core to our values and to      \ndelivering on Responsible Growth for our clients, customers, and communities      \naround the globe. Our Board and its Compensation and Human Capital Committee      \nprovide oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs,           \ninitiatives, and practices. Our senior management provides regular briefings and  \nreporting on human capital matters to the Board and its committees to facilitate  \nthe Board\u2019s oversight. Talent, inclusion, and opportunity. A key aspect of        \nResponsible Growth is attracting and retaining exceptional talent from around the \nworld to our company. This starts with how we recruit new employees and extends to\nthe many ways we support their professional development and career growth. We have\nbuilt a strong pipeline of talent, which means finding and hiring external        \ncandidates who are committed to our purpose and have a passion for serving our    \nclients and communities. We also provide a variety of resources to help employees \ngrow in their current roles and build new skills, including resources to help     \nemployees find new opportunities, re-skill,and seek leadership positions. We have \n11 Employee Networks with over 320,000 voluntary memberships which provide        \nteammates opportunities to meet new people, have an impact across multiple        \nbusiness lines, and grow personally and professionally. They are open to all      \nemployees and participation is voluntary. As part of our ongoing efforts to make  \nour company a great place to work, we conduct a confidential annual Employee      \nEngagement Survey and have done so for nearly two decades. The survey results are \nreviewed by the Board and senior management and used to assist in reviewing the   \ncompany\u2019s human capital strategies, programs, initiatives, and practices.         \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    39  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                  \n  Responsible\u00a0Growth:\u00a0Growth\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0Sustainable  \n                                                  \nEmployee Engagement Survey (1)and turnover results Recognizing and rewarding      \nperformance. Our pay-for-performance compensation approach strives to recognize   \nand reward performance with market competitive pay at all levels of our company.  \nWe regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our        \nindustry to confirm our pay is competitive. We have consistently been an industry \nleader in establishing an internal minimum rate of pay. In October 2024, we took a\nstep closer to our goal of increasing our minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees  \nto $25 by 2025, and increased our minimum wage to $24 per hour. In addition, in   \nJanuary 2025, for the eighth year since 2017, we announced that we will recognize \nour teammates with Sharing Success compensation awards for their efforts during   \n2024. Most awards are in the form of company common stock that vests over four    \nyears, providing the opportunity to further share in our company\u2019s long-term      \nsuccess and align employees interests with shareholders.                          \n                                                                                  \n  We are committed to equal pay for                                               \n  equal work and we maintain robust                                               \n  policies and practices                                                          \n  that reinforce our commitment.

Our policy covers any transactions where the aggregate      \namount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our\ncompany is a participant, and a related person has or will have a direct or       \nindirect material interest. Under our related person transactions policy, our     \nCorporate Governance Committee must approve or ratify any related person          \ntransactions, and when doing so, consider: the related person\u2019s interest in the   \ntransaction; whether the transaction involves arm\u2019s-lengthbids or market prices   \nand terms; the transaction\u2019s materiality to each party; the availability of the   \nproduct or services through other sources; the implications of our Code of Conduct\nor reputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a director\u2019s or        \nexecutive officer\u2019s judgment to act in our company\u2019s best interest; the           \ntransaction\u2019s acceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an independent  \ndirector, whether the transaction would impair his or her independence or status  \nas an \u201coutside\u201d or \u201cnon-employee\u201ddirector. Our Board has determined that certain  \ntypes of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material      \ninterest on the part of the related person and therefore do not require review or \napproval under the policy. These include transactions involving financial         \nservices, including: loans and brokerage; banking, insurance, investment advisory,\nor asset management services; and other financial services we provide to any      \nrelated person, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of business,  \non substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable    \nservices provided to non-affiliates,and comply with applicable law, including the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. A number of our\ndirectors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family members, and   \ncertain business organizations associated with them are or have been clients of   \nour banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons have been made\nin the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including     \ninterest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in comparable      \ntransactions with persons not related to our company and did not involve more than\nthe normal risk of collectability. Occasionally, we may have employees who are    \nImmediate Family Members of our executive officers, directors, or director        \nnominees. The son of Mr. D. Steve Boland, an executive officer in 2024 who has    \nannounced his retirement, and the brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee,   \nare each employed by the company in non-executive, non-strategicpositions, and    \neach received compensation in 2024 of approximately $205,000 and $490,000,        \nrespectively. Dr. Zuber\u2019s brother\u2019s compensation is primarily commissions based.  \nThe methodology through which his compensation is calculated is consistent with   \nthat used for other financial advisors in similar roles. The compensation and     \nother terms of employment of both Mr. Boland\u2019s son and Dr. Zuber\u2019s brother are    \ndetermined on a basis consistent with the company\u2019s human resources policies. Our \ncompany and Mr. Moynihan are parties to an aircraft time-sharing agreement, as    \ndisclosed in prior proxy statements and approved by our Corporate Governance      \nCommittee in December 2010. In addition, the company and each of our executive    \nofficers have entered into nonexclusive aircraft time-sharing agreements. These   \nagreements provide a means under Federal Aviation Administration regulations for  \nour executive officers to reimburse the company for incremental costs of permitted\npersonal travel on our company\u2019s aircraft. To the extent such aircraft usage      \nexceeds the dollar threshold in our related person transactions policy, it will be\nreviewed for approval or ratification by our Corporate Governance Committee.

These and     \nother routine business transactions between the companies were entered into on an \narm\u2019s-lengthbasis and contain customary terms and conditions.

The number of restricted shares awarded is equal \nto the dollar value of the award divided by the closing price of our common stock \non the NYSE on the grant date, rounded down to the next whole share, with cash    \npaid for any fractional share. The annual restricted stock award is subject to a  \none-yearvesting requirement. Dividends accrue during the one-yearvesting period   \nand are paid when the award vests. If a director retires before the one-          \nyearvesting date, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days\nthe director served during the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested     \namount of the award is forfeited. Director compensation review Our Compensation   \nand Human Capital Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates  \nto the director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee\u2019s   \nrecommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in\nmarket practices, and consultation with the Committee\u2019s independent compensation  \nconsultant, Semler Brossy. In 2024, the Committee reviewed director compensation, \ntaking into account multiple factors including pay practices at publicly traded   \ncompanies and the continued expansion of non-management director responsibilities \nand growing time commitments. Based on that review and the Committee\u2019s            \nrecommendation, our Board approved an increase to the annual cash award to        \n$130,000 and an increase to the annual restricted stock award to $280,000 for all \nnon-management directors. The Board also approved an increase to the incremental  \nannual restricted stock award for our Lead Independent Director to $175,000, in   \nlight of the Lead Independent Director\u2019s expanding time commitment, active        \ninvolvement in shareholder engagement and regulator communication, and external   \nand internal recognition of his effective Board leadership. Our Board also        \napproved increasing incremental annual cash awards for all committee chair service\nto $50,000, which acknowledges that serving as the chair of any of the committees \nis a significant responsibility. These changes will take effect as of our 2025    \nannual meeting and will be payable to our director nominees who are successfully  \nelected at the meeting. Director compensation limit (new for 2025) Subject to     \nshareholder approval of Proposal 4, the amended and restated BACEP will limit the \nmaximum number of shares that may be awarded to a non-management director in a    \ncalendar year, together with any cash fees paid to that director, to $1 million in\ntotal value, with certain exceptions described in Proposal 4 and the BACEP.       \nDirector deferral plan Non-managementdirectors may elect to defer all or a portion\nof their annual restricted stock or cash awards through the Bank of America       \nCorporation Director Deferral Plan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors elect \nto defer their restricted stock award, their stock account is credited with stock \nunits equal in value to the restricted stock award and subject to the same vesting\nrequirement applicable to restricted stock                                        \n                         \n  44    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  Director\u00a0compensation  \n                         \nawards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a share of our common   \nstock but because it is not an actual share of our common stock, it does not have \nany voting rights. When directors elect to defer their cash award, they may choose\nto defer into either a stock account or a cash account. Deferrals into a stock    \naccount are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional stock    \nunits and deferrals into the cash account are credited with interest at a long-   \nterm bond rate. Following retirement from our Board and depending on the          \ndirector\u2019s selection, a non-managementdirector may receive the stock account      \nbalance (to the extent vested) and cash account balance in a single lump-sumcash  \npayment or in a series of cash installment payments.

At our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, a majority of  \nshareholders voted to have a \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote each year. As a result, we will    \nconduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually at least until the    \nnext shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. Although the \u201cSay  \non Pay\u201d vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, our Compensation and    \nHuman Capital Committee will take into consideration the outcome of the vote when \nmaking future executive compensation decisions. At the 2024 annual meeting of     \nshareholders, 91.4% of the votes cast favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. The      \nCommittee considered this result and input from investors during our shareholder  \nengagement process, and in light of the strong support, maintained a consistent   \noverall approach for compensating named executive officers for 2024 full year     \nperformance. Our Board has designed our current executive compensation program to \nappropriately link compensation realized by our executive officers to our         \nperformance and properly align the interests of our executive officers with those \nof our shareholders. The details of this compensation for 2024, and the reasons we\nawarded it, are described in \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis,\u201d starting     \nbelow.                                                                            \n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d approving our   \n  executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding  \n  \u201cSay on Pay\u201d resolution) (Proposal 2).            \n                                                    \nOur Board recommends that our shareholders vote in favor of the following         \nresolution: \u201cResolved, that our shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the   \ncompensation of our company\u2019s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to  \nthe compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \nincluding the Compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables, and  \nthe accompanying narrative discussion disclosed in this proxy statement.\u201d         \nCompensation discussion and analysis                                              \n                                                            \n  1.\u2003Executive summary                                  48  \n  a.\u2003Shareholder engagement\u00a0& \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results      48  \n  b.\u2003Executive compensation philosophy                  49  \n  c.\u2003Philosophy on one-time awards                      49  \n  d.\u20032024 Executive compensation highlights             50  \n  2.\u2003Performance evaluation and pay decision process    51  \n  3.\u20032024 Company, segment, & individual performance    53  \n  a.\u2003Company performance                                53  \n  b.\u2003Segment performance                                54  \n  c.

Executive summary a. Shareholder engagement & \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results We value the\nviews and input of our shareholders. Input received from our shareholder          \nengagement is critical to how we drive progress in our corporate governance       \npractices, including our executive compensation program. Generally, we engage with\nour investors year-round through targeted, active outreach and responsiveness to  \ninbound inquiries. During 2024 and early 2025, we reached out to 80 institutional \nshareholders, representing approximately 58% of institutionally held shares,      \n(1)and held a total of 57 meetings with 39 shareholders. We also engaged with the \ntwo largest U.S. proxy advisory firms. Our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell, \nplayed a central role in these discussions and our Compensation and Human Capital \nCommittee Chair, Ms. Lozano, participated in engagement meetings when             \ncompensation-related topics were anticipated. Mr. Nowell and Ms. Lozano actively  \nled 37 of our shareholder engagement meetings, representing approximately 41% of  \ninstitutionally held shares. At our 2024 annual meeting, of the approximately 5.6 \nbillion votes cast at the meeting, 91.4% favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. Input \nfrom engagement with institutional shareholders, together with the 2024 \u201cSay on   \nPay\u201d results, indicated strong support for our compensation program and informed  \nour decision to maintain a consistent executive compensation design and in        \napplying our pay-for-performancephilosophy. Following our 2024 Annual Meeting, we \ncontinued our long-standing practice of engaging with our shareholders and used   \nengagement as an opportunity to confirm that our compensation program and enhanced\ndisclosures appropriately reflected shareholder input and perspectives. Overall,  \ninvestors expressed support for our compensation program and structure, its       \nalignment with the four tenets of Responsible Growth, and the enhancements        \nimplemented in 2023 and early 2024. As a result, the Committee retained these     \nenhancements, summarized below, supporting our commitment to incorporating        \nshareholder input into our disclosures and program design.                        \n                                                                                  \n       The Committee declared its philosophy on one-time awards, including only   \n  \u2022    to be used infrequently and in exceptional circumstances, and did not      \n       grant any one-time equity awards to NEOs for 2024 performance (see page    \n       49)                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Enhanced disclosure of the Committee\u2019s step-by-step performance            \n  \u2022    evaluation and pay decision process, which more clearly illustrates that   \n       business judgment is applied after the Committee completes a robust and    \n       metric-oriented evaluation of performance (see page 51)                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Included pay rationale highlights for each NEO, including the CEO, in      \n  \u2022    addition to individual performance highlights to demonstrate the link      \n       from performance factors to the compensation decisions more clearly (see   \n       page 55)                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Disclosure of relative performance results the Committee uses to evaluate  \n       company performance each year (see page 53)                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Enhanced peer group including updates to our leading financial             \n  \u2022    institutions peer group to include U.S. regional banks and credit card     \n       and wealth management companies to provide a broader range of competitors  \n       (see page 64)                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Enhanced disclosure of the performance year compensation table to include  \n       multiple years of performance compensation determinations (see page 58)    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Increased the percentage of variable pay delivered in long-term            \n  \u2022    equity-based awards from 60% to 70% to further drive long-term alignment   \n       with shareholders (see page 59)                                            \n                                                                                  \nSee additional details in the \u201cExecutive summary\u201d of the Compensation discussion  \nand analysis on page 55 of our 2024 proxy statement.                              \n                                                          \n  (1)  Based on stock ownership as of December\u00a031, 2024.  \n                                                          \n                         \n  48    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \nb. Executive compensation philosophy Our compensation philosophy is to pay for    \nperformance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance    \nconsiderations include both financial and non-financialmeasures\u2014including the     \nmanner in which results are achieved\u2014for the company, line of business, and the   \nindividual. The \u201cPerformance evaluation and pay decision process\u201d section on page \n51 presents the range of performance and governance considerations that the       \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee considers as inputs into compensation    \ndecisions. These factors are evaluated each year and have remained generally      \nconsistent over time as part of a balanced and disciplined approach to the        \ncompensation decision process. Within that broader framework, the \u201cCompany        \nperformance\u201d and \u201cSegment performance\u201d sections on pages 53 and 54 highlight key  \ncompany and segment performance considerations for 2024, and the \u201cIndividual      \nperformance and pay rationale highlights\u201d section beginning on page 55 focuses on \nperformance for each of our NEOs. These considerations reinforce and promote      \nResponsible Growth and maintain alignment with our Risk Framework. Our executive  \ncompensation program provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over \ntime to align executive officer and shareholder interests. Our Compensation and   \nHuman Capital Committee has the primary responsibility for approving our          \ncompensation strategy and philosophy, and the compensation programs applicable to \nour NEOs listed below. With respect to Mr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation, our           \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee makes a recommendation that is further   \nreviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board. c. Philosophy on   \none-timeawards The Compensation and Human Capital Committee believes that one-    \ntimeawards should be used infrequently and in exceptional circumstances to achieve\nbusiness objectives beyond that which could be achieved through annual performance\nyear compensation. The Committee has demonstrated its belief in this philosophy   \nthrough a history of limiting the grant of one-timeawards to executive officers.  \nMr. Moynihan, as CEO, has never received a one-timeaward. Based on input received \nfrom our shareholders, the Committee will continue to limit the use of one-       \ntimeawards to exceptional circumstances and disclose a clear rationale for any    \nsuch award in the Compensation discussion and analysis when granted to NEOs.      \nAdditionally, the Committee follows an approach aligned with the following        \nprinciples:                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n       One-time awards may be appropriate in exceptional circumstances to retain  \n  \u2022    key executives, to drive stability in the organization, or in other        \n       unique circumstances.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Future one-time awards should include performance features, in the event   \n       that one-time awards are deemed appropriate.                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The use of one-time awards allows the application of award provisions      \n  \u2022    aligned with business objectives that may be different than annual         \n       performance year awards (e.g., back-loaded, retentive vesting schedule).   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Granting one-time awards as separate and distinct from annual              \n  \u2022    compensation helps to reinforce that these awards should not be expected   \n       in subsequent years.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    One-time awards will not be granted to offset reduced performance year     \n       incentives or missed performance standards.                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  The Compensation and Human Capital Committee did  \n  not grant any one-time equity awards to NEOs in   \n  2024.                                             \n                                                    \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    49  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \nd. 2024 Executive compensation highlights Named executive officers                \n                                                                             \n  Brian T.

Performance evaluation and pay decision process Each year, our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee undertakes a structured and disciplined approach to       \nevaluate our NEOs\u2019 performance and determine compensation. I. Performance Metrics \nand Scorecards At the start of each year, goals aligned to the tenets of          \nResponsible Growth are set for each executive officer and progress to meeting     \nthose goals is tracked on scorecards. Individual scorecards are tailored to each  \nNEO and include enterprise-wide and line of business metrics. These scorecards and\nadditional performance information are reviewed by the Board over the course of   \nthe year and evaluated at the conclusion of each performance year. In addition to \nevaluation of the scorecards, the Committee\u2019s compensation decision process       \nincludes a robust review of company and line of business performance as well as   \nindividual performance for each NEO. The Committee considers both absolute and    \nrelative metrics when evaluating performance, including relative rankings for     \ncompany performance against our peers and market share for relevant business      \nsegments. For relative metrics considered in 2024, see the \u201c2024 Company, segment,\n& individual performance\u201d section on page 53. Our performance framework for NEOs  \nis aligned to qualitative and quantitative metrics associated with the four tenets\nof Responsible Growth. Below are examples of key metrics considered under each    \ntenet of Responsible Growth that are tracked and evaluated across company, line of\nbusiness, and individual performance, as appropriate by role. These metrics are   \ngenerally consistent from year to year and support the Committee in tracking and  \nevaluating progress over time.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                Responsible                                                       \n                Growth:                                                           \n                Performance                                                       \n                Metrics                                                           \n                                                  Grow within      Grow in a      \n                                                  our              sustainable    \n  Grow and win                   Grow with our    Risk             manner \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200a  \n  in                             customer-foc\u2026    Framework \u00a0 \u2022    Focused        \n  the market \u00a0                   strategy \u00a0 \u2022\u2002    Driving a        sustainabili\u2026  \n  \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200aNet                        Customer         strong           leadership in  \n  income \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009                   satisfaction     risk             support of     \n  Revenue \u00a0 \u2022\u2002                   and              management       strategy \u00a0 \u2022\u2002  \n  Total                          client           culture \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009    Being a great  \n  shareholder                    experience \u00a0     Asset            place to work  \n  return \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009                   \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200aDigital      quality/char\u2026    \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200aOngoing    \n  Return on                      adoption \u00a0 \u2022\u2002    \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200a             focus on       \n  assets \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009                   Deposit          Year-over-ye\u2026    Operational    \n  Tangible                       growth \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200a    performance      Excellence \u00a0   \n  book value                     New accounts     relative to      \u2022\u2002\u2009\u200a           \n                                                  established      Supporting     \n                                                  risk metrics     our            \n                                                                   communities    \n                                                                                  \nII.

Evaluation and Pay Decisions Evaluation and pay decisions begin with a robust\nand detailed review of performance results aligned with the four tenets of        \nResponsible Growth. The evaluation considers the \u201cWhat,\u201d which includes an        \nevaluation of performance against scorecard metrics, and the \u201cHow\u201d which includes \nthe manner in which results, both financial and non-financial,were achieved.      \nMetrics are reviewed on an absolute basis against the scorecard and key metrics   \nare also reviewed on a relative basis against primary competitors. This metric-   \ndriven evaluation drives the preliminary pay discussion. After the Committee has  \ncompleted its robust and metric-driven performance evaluation to determine        \npreliminary pay, the Committee weighs additional considerations such as market and\ngovernance practices, scope of role, experience, and prior year compensation to   \nhelp inform the final total compensation determination. The Committee believes its\nuse of business judgment and discretion, structured within the framework and      \ngovernance of the tenets of Responsible Growth, is in the best interests of our   \nshareholders, customers and clients, employees, and the communities we serve. This\nenables the Committee to appropriately respond to the complexities of internal and\nexternal factors when determining performance year compensation, including the    \ncomplexity of operating a business the size of Bank of America and the regulatory \nframework in which the company operates. Compensation decisions are generally     \ndetermined on a year-over-year basis without preset target levels of total        \ncompensation. Once performance year total compensation is determined for each NEO,\nthe Committee applies the variable pay mix, which includes a majority of pay to be\ndelivered over the long-term and subject to risk management features. See         \n\u201cExecutive compensation program features\u201d and \u201cCompensation risk management       \nfeatures\u201d on pages 59 and 61. The Committee\u2019s performance year total compensation \nrecommendations are then subject to a multi-step review and approval process      \noutlined below. IV. Approval During the final stage of the pay decision process,  \nthe Committee engages in a multi-step review and approval process involving our   \nindependent Board members and other Board committees.                             \n                                                                             \n  \u2022    The Committee approves compensation for all NEOs, excluding the CEO.  \n                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n       For our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the Committee\u2019s pay  \n  \u2022    recommendations are further reviewed and approved by our Board\u2019s           \n       Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    For the CEO, the Committee\u2019s pay recommendations are further reviewed and  \n       approved by the independent members of our Board.                          \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  52    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \n3. 2024 Company, segment, & individual performance a. Company performance         \nFollowing are financial highlights and key measures of company and line of        \nbusiness performance achieved in 2024. Our Compensation and Human Capital         \nCommittee and Board considered these metrics in evaluating the 2024 performance of\nour NEOs. In 2024, we delivered solid earnings and returns on equity, strong      \norganic growth and more capital back to shareholders than 2023. These results were\naided by our focus on Responsible Growth with a diverse operating model and risk  \nmanagement focus during a challenging interest rate environment.

Standards for performance restricted stock units Re-earningthe PRSUs granted in\nFebruary 2025 (based on 2024 performance) requires the company to meet average ROA\nand average adjusted TBV growth standards (tax-normalized)over a three-year       \nperformance period from 2025-2027. The Committee made no change to the standards  \nfor performance year 2024 PRSU awards. Under a hypothetical scenario, if our 2024 \nfull-year average assets of $3.3 trillion remained constant during the performance\nperiod, our company would need to earn $78.8 billion in aggregate net income from \n2025-2027 to achieve the PRSU 80 bps ROA standard. On an annualized basis, this   \nequals approximately $26.3 billion in earnings which is higher than reported net  \nincome in six of the last twelve years. These performance metrics and standards   \nencourage the achievement of sustained shareholder value and Responsible Growth.  \nPRSUs are forfeited if results are below both minimum standards. PRSUs granted    \nsince 2017 provide no upside payout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be  \nre-earnedfor these awards).

Multiple cancellation & clawback features Our equity-based awards are subject \nto three separate and distinct features that can result in the awards being       \ncanceled or prior payments being clawed back in the event of certain detrimental  \nconduct or financial losses. These features were designed to encourage appropriate\nbehavior and manage risk in our compensation program. Our NEOs are subject to all \nthree cancellation and clawback features. For the avoidance of doubt, all CRSUs,  \nPRSUs, and TRSUs awarded to our CEO and other NEOs are subject to all three       \ncancellation and clawback features described below.

Other compensation topics a. Results for performance         \nrestricted stock units PRSUs have been a component of our executive compensation  \nprogram since 2011. PRSUs require recipients to re-earnawards over the performance\nperiod based on achievement of established performance standards and help align   \nmanagement with shareholder interests. Since 2013, PRSUs have been based 50% on   \nthree-year average ROA and 50% on three-year average growth in adjusted TBV       \nstandards. Our practice is not to make discretionary adjustments to PRSU results  \nfor the impact of legacy litigation, fines, and penalties, or impairment charges, \nwhich have contributed to outcomes for PRSU payouts since their introduction. The \n2022 PRSUs completed in 2024 were re-earnedat 100% of the target opportunity based\non ROA results of 85bps and adjusted TBV results of 11.41% (compared to 100%      \ntarget opportunity based on 2022 PRSU performance standards set at ROA results of \n\u226580 bps and TBV results of \u22658.5%). (1)We did not adjust the calculation of these  \nperformance metrics to reflect the FDIC special assessment in 2024. See the       \ndescription of the 2022 PRSUs and vesting terms following the \u201cGrants of plan-    \nbased awards table\u201d on page 71 of our 2023 proxy statement. The maximum payout    \nopportunity is 100% for all outstanding awards. The award terms for these PRSUs   \nprovide for the calculation of performance results at the conclusion of each      \ncalendar year in the performance period. As a result, the performance results     \nabove may differ from the results reported under GAAP in our company\u2019s audited    \nfinancial statements.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n  (1)  The three-year average ROA and three-year average growth in adjusted TBV   \n       results for the 2022 PRSUs were calculated as follows:                     \n                                                                                  \nThree-year Average ROA (tax-normalized) was the average \u201creturn on assets\u201d for the\nthree calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, \u201creturn on      \nassets\u201d was determined at the conclusion of each year based on the generally      \naccepted accounting principles (GAAP) definition and, to the extent necessary,    \nnormalized to exclude the material effects of changes in the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day of the performance    \nperiod. Three-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV was the average year-over-year  \npercentage change in \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for the three calendar years  \nin the performance period. For this purpose, \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for   \neach year equaled our total common shareholders\u2019 equity, less (a) the impact of   \nany capital actions approved by our company\u2019s Board and completed by our Company, \nand less (b) the sum of the carrying value of: (i) goodwill and (ii) intangible   \nassets excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted for (iii) deferred tax       \nliabilities directly related to (i) and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage      \nchange was measured after the conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning\nbalance as of January 1 and the ending balance as of December 31 of that year and,\nto the extent necessary, was normalized to exclude the material effects of changes\nin the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the    \nfirst day of the performance period.                                              \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    63  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \nb. 2024 Competitor group Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee periodically\nreviews compensation practices of competitors to evaluate market trends, pay      \nlevels, and relative performance in executive compensation, but without any       \nformulaic benchmarking. The Committee constructs a peer group that best reflects  \nthe unique complexity of our business. Given our size and scale, we consider five \nprimary competitors and eleven leading financial institutions.

Retirement benefits We provide our NEOs the      \nopportunity to save for their retirement via employee and employer contributions  \nto qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on the same terms as     \nother U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract and retain key   \npeople by providing a means to save for retirement. Certain NEOs also participate \nin various frozen qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. For   \nmore information about these plans, see \u201cPension benefits table\u201d and \u201cNonqualified\ndeferred compensation table\u201d on pages 73 and 74, respectively. d. Health and      \nwelfare benefits & perquisites Our NEOs receive health and welfare benefits, such \nas medical, life, and long-term disability coverage, under plans generally        \navailable to all other U.S.-based salaried employees; in addition, our NEOs are   \neligible to receive an annual physical exam. Because we have internal expertise on\nfinancial advisory matters, we do not charge fees to our NEOs for their use of our\nfinancial advisory services for personal needs. We also may provide certain NEOs  \nwith secured parking. For information security purposes and efficiency, NEOs are  \npermitted to use a car service when commuting to and from our offices or business-\nrelated events; participating NEOs reimburse the company for incremental costs    \nincurred. In limited circumstances, we may occasionally provide meals and allow   \nspouses or guests to accompany executives traveling for a business-related purpose\nand pay for other incidental expenses. Our policy provides for the use of         \ncorporate aircraft by senior management for approved travel. For reasons of       \nsecurity, personal safety, and efficiency, we require our CEO to use corporate    \naircraft for all business and personal air travel. Our executive officers,        \nincluding our NEOs other than our CEO, are permitted to use corporate aircraft for\nlimited personal travel with reimbursement to the company for incremental costs,  \npursuant to their aircraft time-sharing agreements.                               \n                         \n  64    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                   \n  Compensation\u00a0and\u00a0Human\u00a0Capital\u00a0Committee\u00a0Report  \n                                                   \ne.

value of stock awards granted  \n       during the year. Typically, we grant stock awards early in the year as     \n       part of total year-end compensation awarded for prior year performance.    \n       As a result, the amounts for stock awards generally appear in the          \n       \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d for the year after the performance year upon  \n       which they were based, and therefore the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d      \n  (1)  does not fully reflect our Compensation and Human Capital Committee\u2019s      \n       view of its pay-for-performance executive compensation program for a       \n       particular performance year. For example, amounts shown as 2024            \n       compensation in the \u201cStock awards\u201d column include stock awards granted in  \n       February 2024 for 2023 performance, as well as other stock awards granted  \n       during 2024 that are not part of performance year 2024 compensation. See   \n       \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d on page 47 for a discussion about   \n       how the Committee viewed its 2024 compensation decisions for the NEOs.     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n  (2)  All listed NEO positions are those held as of December\u00a031, 2024.  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n       Includes any amounts voluntarily deferred under our qualified 401(k) plan  \n  (3)  and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

Grants of stock-based awards      \n       (excluding CRSUs) include the right to receive cash dividends only if and  \n       when the underlying award becomes vested and payable. The grant date fair  \n       value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the applicable  \n       grant date ($34.07 on February 15, 2024). For the PRSUs granted in 2024,   \n       the actual number of PRSUs earned (0% up to the maximum level of 100%)     \n       will depend on our company\u2019s future achievement of specific ROA and        \n  (5)  growth in adjusted TBV standards (tax-normalized) over a three-year        \n       performance period ending December 31, 2026. Values in the \u201cStock awards\u201d  \n       column assume that 100% (the maximum level) of the PRSUs granted would     \n       vest as the probable outcome for purposes of determining the grant date    \n       fair value. For TRSUs granted in 2024, the award is settled 50% in shares  \n       and 50% in cash for all NEOs, except for Mr. Moynihan for whom the award   \n       is settled 100% in shares.

In late 2017, we amended our policy to require Mr. Moynihan to use only   \ncorporate aircraft for all business, and personal flights. We generally do not    \nconsider amounts related to business- and/or business-development related flights \nas compensation to Mr. Moynihan, and we consider the amounts related to Mr.       \nMoynihan\u2019s required personal and commuting use of our corporate aircraft to be    \nnecessary business expenses for reasons of security, personal safety, and         \nefficiency. However, SEC rules require that we include in the \u201cSummary            \ncompensation table\u201d the value of certain flights or portions of certain flights as\na perquisite. Therefore, the amount shown for Mr. Moynihan for use of corporate   \naircraft primarily reflects the aggregate incremental cost to our company for: (i)\nelements of business- and/or business-development related flights and (ii) all    \npersonal flights taken for non-commuting, non-businesspurposes.

For        \n       Messrs. Borthwick, Athanasia, DeMare, and Koder, 50% of the TRSUs granted  \n       in 2024 are settled in shares and 50% are settled in cash. For Mr.         \n       Moynihan, 100% of the TRSUs granted in 2024 are settled in shares.         \n       Because the grant date fair value for these awards is based on the         \n       closing price of our common stock on the grant date ($34.07) on February\u00a0  \n  (2)  15, 2024, the dollar amount of the grant date fair value will differ       \n       slightly from the original award value determined by our Compensation and  \n       Human Capital Committee. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs and the    \n       share-settled TRSUs granted in 2024 includes a discount of 12.5% to        \n       reflect the impact of post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of   \n       these awards. The discount rate does not apply to the CRSUs or             \n       cash-settled portion of the TRSUs.

All such determinations will be final and      \n       binding.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The following chart shows how the PRSUs are treated if a NEO terminates    \n       employment:                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Reason for termination                  Impact on vesting and payment date      \n  Death                                   Full vesting at the maximum level;      \n                                          immediate payment                       \n                                          Continue to earn and pay per schedule,  \n                                          subject to return on assets and         \n  Disability                              adjusted TBV performance,               \n                                          covenants,(1) and performance-based     \n                                          cancellation                            \n  Involuntary for cause(2)                Canceled                                \n  Involuntary without cause or            Canceled, unless eligible for           \n  voluntary                               Qualifying Termination                  \n                                          Continue to earn and pay per schedule,  \n                                          generally provided the executive        \n                                          officer does not subsequently work for  \n                                          a competitive business and annually     \n  Qualifying Termination(3)               provides a written certification of     \n                                          compliance and subject to return on     \n                                          assets and adjusted TBV performance,    \n                                          covenants,(1) and performance-based     \n                                          cancellation                            \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    69  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  Executive\u00a0compensation  \n                          \n                                                                                  \n       Covenants for vesting purposes are nonsolicitation, detrimental conduct,   \n       and compliance with anti-hedging/derivative transactions policies.

The component plans are cash  \nbalance pension plans where notional cash balance accounts grow based on notional \ncredits. As of June 30, 2012, participants no longer receive compensation credits \nor years of credited service under the Legacy Pension Plan.

Payments are made in a lump-sumor up to 15 annual          \ninstallments beginning in the year of termination of employment or any later year \nelected by the participant, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns\n65. Legacy ESA plan. Mr. Athanasia has a nonqualified deferred compensation       \naccount that was established prior to FleetBoston\u2019s merger with Bank of America   \nCorporation and funded by employer contributions (Legacy ESA Plan). This plan was \nclosed to contributions in 2004. Upon his termination of employment, Mr. Athanasia\nwill be paid in equal installments over a one-yearrestrictive covenant period,    \nunless he terminates due to death or disability. Potential payments upon          \ntermination or change in control We do not have any agreements with our NEOs that \nprovide for cash severance payments upon termination of employment or a change in \ncontrol. In addition, since 2002, we have maintained the Bank of America          \nCorporation Corporate Policy Regarding Seeking Stockholder Approval of Future     \nSeverance Agreements (the Severance Agreement Approval Policy). Under our         \nSeverance Agreement Approval Policy, we will not enter into employment or         \nseverance agreements with our executive officers that provide severance benefits  \nexceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined under the Severance         \nAgreement Approval Policy), unless the agreement has been approved by our         \nshareholders. Potential payments from equity-based awards Our equity-based awards \nto our NEOs include standard provisions that cause awards to vest or be forfeited \nupon termination of employment, depending on the reason for termination. These    \nprovisions for awards granted in 2024 are described in more detail on page 68, and\nthose details can be found for awards granted in prior years in our prior proxy   \nstatements. In general, our awards provide for continued payments on the original \nschedule after certain types of termination of employment, subject to the         \nfollowing conditions, as applicable in individual award agreements:               \n                                                                                  \n       In case of a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d, the award continues to be paid      \n       according to the award\u2019s payment schedule if the executive complies with   \n       certain covenants, including not working for a competitive business. A     \n       Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or involuntary termination      \n       (other than for death, disability, or cause) after the executive has met   \n       certain specified age and/or service requirements. For awards granted      \n       before February\u00a015, 2022, the NEOs must have at least 10 years of service  \n       and their age and years of service must add up to at least 60 (sometimes   \n       referred to in prior years as \u201cRule of 60\u201d). For awards granted on or      \n       after February\u00a015, 2022 but before February\u00a015, 2024, the NEOs must have   \n       at least 10 years of service and reached at least age 50. For awards       \n       granted on or after February\u00a015, 2024, the NEOs must have at least 10      \n       years of service and reached at least age 55 or must have reached at       \n       least age 60. Pursuant to a March 4, 2019, letter agreement, Mr. Koder     \n       has a special eligibility standard. Currently, each of the NEOs meets the  \n  \u2022    applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination.                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Awards remain subject to performance-based cancellation prior to payment   \n       and may be canceled in whole or in part if losses occur. Awards also can   \n       be canceled or recouped if the executive engages in detrimental conduct.   \n  \u2022    Further, under our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, the Board     \n       can require reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid to an         \n       executive officer whose fraud or intentional misconduct causes our         \n       company to restate its financial statements and can claw back certain      \n       incentive compensation if an accounting restatement is required.           \n                                                                                  \nAwards to our NEOs under the BACEP are generally designed to be paid per schedule \nif an executive\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or for \u201cgood reason\u201d   \nwithin two years after a change in control. This change in control treatment is   \noften referred to as \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting, because it requires both: (i) a    \nchange in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary termination (either by our    \ncompany without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d). The BACEP does not\nprovide our executive officers \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting upon a change in control. \nIf a NEO is terminated for \u201ccause,\u201d our equity-based awards provide that the      \nawards will be forfeited. The following table shows the value of equity awards    \nthat would have been payable, subject to the non-competeor compliance with        \ncovenants, as applicable, for a termination of employment as of December 31, 2024.\nFor this purpose, restricted stock units were valued at our closing price as of   \nDecember 31, 2024, which was $43.95 per share. Due to a number of factors that    \naffect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon termination of         \nemployment, any actual amounts paid or distributed may vary from the amounts      \nlisted below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the time during the \nyear of any such event, any accrued but unpaid cash dividend equivalents and      \nrelated interest, and the price of our common stock.                              \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    75  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  Executive\u00a0compensation  \n                          \nPotential payments from restricted stock units                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                   Ter\u2026                           \n                                                   with                           \n                                                   good                           \n                                                   rea\u2026                           \n                                                   or            All              \n                                                   wit\u2026          other            \n         Dea\u2026          Dis\u2026                        cau\u2026          term\u2026            \n                                                   wit\u2026          exce\u2026            \n                                                   two           for\u00a0             \n                                                   yea\u2026          cause            \n                                                   fol\u2026                           \n                                                   cha\u2026                           \n                                                   in                             \n                                                   con\u2026                           \n                                     Pay\u2026          Pay\u2026          Paya\u2026            \n                                     per\u00a0          per           per\u00a0             \n         Pay\u2026          Pay\u2026          awa\u2026          awa\u2026          award            \n  Na\u2026    imm\u2026          imm\u2026          sch\u2026          sch\u2026          sche\u2026            \n         ($)           ($)           sub\u2026          sub\u2026          subj\u2026            \n                                     to            to            to               \n                                     con\u2026          con\u2026          cond\u2026            \n                                     ($)\u2026          ($)           ($)(\u2026            \n  Br\u2026                                                                             \n  T.           70,\u2026          1,8\u2026          69,\u2026          69,\u2026           69,\u2026      \n  Mo\u2026                                                                             \n  Al\u2026                                                                             \n  M.           26,\u2026             0          26,\u2026          26,\u2026           23,\u2026  -3  \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  C.           35,\u2026             0          35,\u2026          35,\u2026           28,\u2026      \n  At\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                                                                             \n  P.           47,\u2026             0          47,\u2026          47,\u2026           40,\u2026      \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  Ma\u2026                                                                             \n  M.           35,\u2026             0          35,\u2026          35,\u2026           34,\u2026  -3  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The conditions for payment include: (i)\u00a0compliance with covenants          \n       regarding non-solicitation, detrimental conduct, and compliance with       \n       anti-hedging/derivative transactions policies; (ii)\u00a0the performance-based  \n       cancellation described above; and (iii)\u00a0compliance with the Qualifying     \n       Termination conditions described above (other than in case of              \n  (1)  Disability), as provided in individual award agreements.

In the event of such a termination,    \n  (3)  the value of the equity-based awards payable as of December 31, 2024,      \n       would have been $24,356,585 for Mr. Borthwick and $35,503,520 for Mr.      \n       Koder, subject to conditions for payment including compliance with         \n       covenants regarding non-solicitation, detrimental conduct, and compliance  \n       with anti-hedging/derivative transaction policies.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Pursuant to a November 2021 letter agreement between Mr.\u00a0DeMare and the    \n       company, Mr.\u00a0DeMare is entitled to an award of cash-settled TRSUs on the   \n       first business day following his termination. These cash-settled TRSUs     \n       will replace any restricted stock units that Mr.\u00a0DeMare previously         \n       received but which lack Qualifying Termination provisions and therefore    \n       are forfeited upon his termination. The cash-settled TRSUs will vest on    \n  (4)  the same schedule as the restricted stock units that are forfeited upon    \n       Mr.\u00a0DeMare\u2019s termination, subject to Mr.\u00a0DeMare\u2019s compliance with certain  \n       covenants, including not engaging in detrimental conduct and not working   \n       for certain competitive businesses. However, this letter agreement does    \n       not provide for continued vesting of the management team stock award       \n       granted to Mr.\u00a0DeMare on February\u00a015, 2023, described in more detail in    \n       \u201cManagement team stock award\u201d on page 66 of our 2024 proxy statement.      \n                                                                                  \nOther potential payments Following termination of employment, our NEOs receive    \npayment of retirement benefits and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits    \nunder our various plans in which they participate. The value of those benefits as \nof December 31, 2024 is set forth in the sections above entitled \u201cPension benefits\ntable\u201d and \u201cNonqualified deferred compensation table.\u201d There are no special or    \nenhanced benefits under those plans for our NEOs, and all of our NEOs are fully   \nvested in the benefits discussed in those sections. We make tax and financial     \nplanning advisory services available to our NEOs during their employment with us. \nThe standard form of this benefit continues through the end of the year in which  \nthe executive ceases employment, including preparation of that year\u2019s tax returns.\nThis benefit may continue for an extended term of up to five years if the         \nexecutive meets the age and service standard for a Qualifying Termination and does\nnot engage in any full-time employment. The benefit offered during the extended   \nterm will end during the calendar year any other full-time employment begins; the \nbenefit, however, will end immediately following termination for cause, or if the \nexecutive engages in detrimental conduct or begins employment with a named        \ncompetitor. Benefits-eligible Bank of America employees who retire with at least  \n10 years of service and their age plus years of service equal to at least 60 have \naccess to continued coverage under our group health plan program, but the employee\ngenerally must pay for the full cost of that coverage on an after-taxbasis without\nany employer subsidy.                                                             \n                         \n  76    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                 \n  CEO\u00a0pay\u00a0ratio  \n                 \nCEO pay ratio Below is: (i) the 2024 annual total compensation of our CEO; (ii)   \nthe 2024 annual total compensation of our median employee; (iii) the ratio of the \nannual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee; and (iv) the \nmethodology we used to calculate our CEO pay ratio:                               \n                                                              \n  CEO pay ratio                                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CEO annual total compensation*               $  28,747,787  \n  Median employee annual total compensation    $     117,234  \n  CEO to median employee pay ratio                     245:1  \n                                                              \n                                                                                  \n  *  This annual total compensation is the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d amount,   \n     plus certain nondiscriminatory benefits (including health insurance).        \n                                                                                  \nMethodology Our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner     \nconsistent with SEC rules.

We began with our global employee          \n       population as of October\u00a01, 2024, including full-time, part-time, and      \n       seasonal or temporary workers, employed by Bank of America or our          \n  \u2022    consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding our CEO.                          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Identified the median employee. We calculated compensation for each        \n       employee using base salary as of October\u00a01, 2024, and estimated overtime,  \n       plus performance year 2023 cash incentives paid and equity awards granted  \n       in 2024. We identified employees within $500 of the median compensation    \n  \u2022    and removed those employees who had anomalous compensation                 \n       characteristics. For each remaining employee, we estimated total           \n       compensation using a method similar to the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d    \n       rules, but including employer health insurance contributions and the       \n       value of other benefits, and then identified the median employee.          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Calculated CEO pay ratio. We calculated our median employee\u2019s annual       \n       total compensation for 2024 according to the SEC\u2019s instructions for        \n  \u2022    preparing the \u201cSummary compensation table,\u201d including employer health      \n       insurance contributions and the value of other benefits. We then           \n       calculated our CEO\u2019s annual total compensation using the same approach to  \n       determine the pay ratio shown above.                                       \n                                                                                  \nWe invest in our employees at all levels in the company by rewarding performance  \nthat balances risk and reward, empowering professional growth and development, and\nby offering affordable benefits and programs that meet the diverse needs of our   \nemployees and their families.

Our pay-for-performance approach bases    \ncompensation on actual results and how those results were achieved. We align      \nexecutive and shareholder interests through a compensation program providing a mix\nof salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time, including deferred equity-    \nbased awards. Review our \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d on page\u00a047 for    \nmore information on executive compensation considerations and decisions for our   \nNEOs. Page 58 of the \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d includes 2024         \ncompensation decisions for our NEOs; these decisions are different than those     \nreflected in the table below which are calculated under prescribed SEC rules.     \nThe table below shows the following information for the past five fiscal years:   \n(i) \u201ctotal\u201d compensation for our NEOs (NEOs) for purposes of the \u201cSummary         \ncompensation table\u201d; (ii) the \u201cCompensation actually paid\u201d to NEOs (calculated    \nusing rules required by the SEC); (iii) our total shareholder return (TSR); (iv)  \nthe TSR of the KBW Bank Index; (v)\u00a0our net income; and (vi)\u00a0our revenue (which is \nour \u201ccompany-selected performance measure\u201d). \u201cCompensation actually paid\u201d does not\nrepresent the value of cash and shares of the company\u2019s common stock received by  \nNEOs during the year, but rather is an amount calculated under SEC rules and      \nincludes, among other things, year-over-year changes in the value of unvested     \nequity-based awards. As a result of the calculation methodology required by the   \nSEC, \u201cCompensation actually paid\u201d amounts below differ from compensation actually \nreceived by the individuals and the compensation deci sio ns described in the     \n\u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d section above.                             \n2024 Pay versus performance table                                                 \n                                                                                  \n       \u201c\u2026        C\u2026        A\u2026        A\u2026                                           \n       t\u2026        p\u2026        t\u2026        p\u2026        C\u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n       C\u2026        C\u2026        f\u2026        t\u2026        (\u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n       (\u2026        (\u2026        N\u2026        N\u2026                  \u2026                        \n                           (\u2026                                                     \n  \u2026        2\u2026        4\u2026        1\u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026       1\u2026       2\u2026       1\u2026  \n  \u2026        2\u2026        3\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026       97       2\u2026       9\u2026  \n  \u2026        3\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026       98       2\u2026       9\u2026  \n  \u2026        2\u2026        4\u2026        1\u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026       1\u2026       3\u2026       8\u2026  \n  \u2026        2\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        1\u2026        88       90       1\u2026       8\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (1)  The CEO for each year reported wasBrian T.

In selecting and approving a lead engagement   \npartner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by      \nmanagement and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates,           \nassessments of their professional experience, and input from our company\u2019s        \nindependent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an   \nannual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm. It        \nconsiders, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best        \ninterests of our company and its shareholders, taking into account the firm\u2019s     \nquality of service, institutional knowledge and experience, international         \ncapabilities, sufficiency of resources, the quality of its communication and      \ninteraction with our company, and its independence, objectivity, and professional \nskepticism.

The Committee has appointed\nPwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the 2025        \nconsolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its          \nsubsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking           \nshareholders to ratify PwC\u2019s appointment. If our shareholders do not ratify PwC\u2019s \nappointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered      \npublic accounting firm for 2026. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC\u2019s         \nappointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public  \naccounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate.   \nPwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with      \nrespect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of  \nthe SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Our Board has determined that all Committee members are independent\nunder NYSE listing standards, our Director Independence Categorical Standards, and\napplicable SEC rules and regulations. Our Board has also determined that all      \nCommittee members are financially literate in accordance with NYSE listing        \nstandards and qualify as \u201caudit committee financial experts\u201d as defined by SEC    \nrules. The Committee\u2019s responsibilities are stated in a written charter adopted by\nour Board. Management is responsible for preparing and the overall reporting      \nprocess with respect to Bank of America Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial      \nstatements, and, with the assistance of the company\u2019s internal corporate auditors,\nfor establishing, maintaining, and assessing the effectiveness of our internal    \ncontrol over financial reporting. PwC, the company\u2019s independent registered public\naccounting firm, is responsible for planning and conducting an independent audit  \nof the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the         \nstandards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)  \nand for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of these financial statements  \nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and as to the  \neffectiveness of the company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. The    \nCommittee\u2019s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. The         \nCommittee annually evaluates PwC\u2019s qualifications, performance, and independence. \nThe Committee also oversees the performance of the corporate audit function       \nmanaged by our Chief Audit Executive. The Committee has reviewed and discussed    \nwith management and with PwC the company\u2019s audited financial statements for the   \nyear ended December 31, 2024, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the \ncompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, and PwC\u2019s evaluation of our  \ncompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the Committee   \nhas discussed with PwC the matters that independent registered public accounting  \nfirms must communicate to audit committees under applicable PCAOB standards. The  \nCommittee has also discussed and confirmed with PwC its independence from our     \ncompany, and received all required written disclosures and correspondence required\nby the PCAOB Ethics and Independence requirements. The Committee has evaluated and\nconcluded the non-auditservices provided by PwC to our company do not impair PwC\u2019s\nindependence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and         \ndiscussions with the Committee\u2019s independent disclosure counsel, the Committee    \nrecommended to our Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and the related footnotes be included in our company\u2019s annual   \nreport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2024.

During our extensive engagement efforts in 2024,  \n       shareholders expressed support for our unique broad use of equity awards   \n       and understood how this practice contributes to burn rate.                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The Compensation and Human Capital Committee exercises oversight of our    \n       compensation program and employee benefits, including the intentional      \n  \u2022    granting of shares under the BACEP, taking into account broader company,   \n       human capital, and capital allocation strategy to support our teammates,   \n       deliver a world-class experience for clients and Responsible Growth for    \n       shareholders.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  82    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nMaterial changes The amendment and restatement makes the following material       \nchanges:                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n       The number of shares of our common stock available for awards under the    \n       Plan will be increased by 100\u00a0million. In 2024, shareholders approved the  \n  \u2022    addition of 100 million shares for grant under the Plan, and the company   \n       awarded approximately 117.4 million in the same year. The additional 100   \n       million shares requested would allow the company to continue current       \n       grant practices for at least one more year.                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The Plan limits the maximum number of shares subject to awards granted to  \n       a non-employee director in a calendar year, together with any cash fees    \n  \u2022    paid during the calendar year to that director, to $1 million in total     \n       value, excluding charitable or in memoriam donations made by the company   \n       and fees paid, at the Board\u2019s discretion, for service on any special       \n       purpose committee or for any other specific service.                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The Plan term is extended through April\u00a021, 2035 (i.e., 10 years after     \n  \u2022    the date of the annual meeting).                                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \nBackground The BACEP was last amended and approved by shareholders in 2024, which \nincluded the addition of 100 million shares available for grant. Under the Plan,  \nwe have reserved a number of shares of our common stock for issuance to employees \n(including executive officers) as equity-based awards in the form of restricted   \nstock, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock options, and SARs and for issuance to \nnon-employeedirectors as restricted stock awards. The BACEP is currently scheduled\nto expire on April 24, 2033. In March 2025, our Board approved the amendment and  \nrestatement of the BACEP to increase the number of common shares available to     \ngrant, limit the maximum number of shares annually awarded to directors, and      \nextend the term of the Plan to April 2035, subject to the approval of our         \nshareholders at the annual meeting. Based on data available as of December 31,    \n2024, our level of overhang was lower than the average for our primary competitor \ngroup. Additionally, our rate at which we grant equity awards relative to shares  \nof our common stock outstanding (sometimes referred to as \u201cburn rate\u201d) was below  \nthe average burn rate for our primary competitor group on a three-year average    \nbasis. If the proposed amendment and restatement is approved, we expect the pool  \nof requested shares to last approximately one year, assuming we maintain similar  \ngrant practices as over the past two years and assuming, hypothetically, our      \ncurrent stock price remains constant. The number of shares remaining available for\ngrant under the BACEP as noted in the table below differs from those reported as  \nof December 31, 2024, because that information does not take into account year-to-\ndategrants during 2025 for the 2024 performance year. Information regarding the   \nnumber of shares remaining available for grant as required by SEC disclosure rules\nare discussed in detail in this proposal under \u201cAdditional information\u201d on page   \n88. The list of companies included in our primary competitor group is detailed    \nunder \u201c2024 Competitor group\u201d on page 64. Impact of the amendment and restatement \nbased on information as of March 3, 2025 As of March 3, 2025, under the current   \nauthorization, there are approximately 85 million shares of common stock available\nfor grant as equity- based awards under the BACEP. Based on our current grant     \npractices, these shares would last less than one year, while the current BACEP    \nterm has eight years remaining. We believe it is appropriate to increase the      \nnumber of shares of our common stock available for awards under the BACEP so that \nour company can continue the practice of granting deferred equity-based awards in \nlieu of cash. We estimate the total dilutive effect of the BACEP and our legacy   \nstock plans on our shareholders (sometimes called \u201coverhang\u201d) resulting from the  \namendment and restatement would be approximately 6.0%, with the incremental       \noverhang resulting from the requested share increase equal to approximately 1.2%. \nThe overhang is calculated as follows, in each case as of March 3, 2025:          \n                                                                          \n  (a) Incremental share request subject to                100,000,000     \n  shareholder approval                                                    \n  (b) Shares underlying outstanding awards of                             \n  restricted shares / stock-settled restricted stock      299,219,789     \n  units under all equity plans(1)                                         \n  (c) Options outstanding under all equity plans(2)                 0     \n  (d) Shares currently available for future issuance       84,942,478     \n  under all equity plans(3)                                               \n  (e) Total shares available for, or outstanding          484,162,267     \n  under, equity awards (a + b + c + d)                                    \n  (f) Total common shares outstanding                   7,602,798,325     \n  (g) Fully diluted overhang (e/(e+f))(4)                         6.0  %  \n  (h) Basic diluted overhang (e/f)                                6.4  %  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n       Includes 7,080,018 vested RSUs subject to a required six- or twelve-month  \n       holding period and 753,102 vested RSUs that are expected to be             \n       issued/delivered within 30 days of the record date.

In addition, our Board believes that equity-based awards aid in our\nability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees and are the most direct way\nto align employee interests with those of shareholders. As part of our pay-for-   \nperformancepractices, more than 100,000 employees receive variable incentives.    \nMore highly compensated employees receive a portion of their variable incentive as\ndeferred RSUs. The portion of the variable incentive deferred as equity-based     \nawards generally increases with compensation levels according to a predetermined  \ndeferral grid. RSUs are also a significant component of the Sharing Success awards\nthat have been or will be made to approximately 97% of employees in March 2025.   \nMost Sharing Success awards are in the form of company common stock, providing the\nopportunity to further share in our company\u2019s long-term success. The RSU awards   \nare a key part of our pay-for-performancephilosophy, and in many cases are        \nrequired by law, rule, and regulation. In addition, our executive officers receive\nPRSUs that must be re-earnedby meeting specific performance criteria, as described\non page 60 for awards granted in February 2025. Equity awards granted to employees\nare subject to cancellation and clawback features which encourage appropriate     \nbehavior and manage risk in our compensation program; these features are described\non page 62. Granting RSU awards that include deferral, cancellation, and clawback \nfeatures is a key risk-balancing mechanism in our pay-for-performancecompensation \nprogram and serves to align employee interests with shareholder interests while   \ncomplying with regulatory requirements. The value of RSUs tracks the price of our \ncommon shares. Compensation expense is in the compensation and benefits expense   \nline of the income statement. The Plan, and the proposed amendment and restatement\nof it, is intended to be the company\u2019s vehicle for delivering deferred equity-    \nbased awards. Since April 2022, the amount of common stock awarded has averaged   \napproximately 111 million shares each year, which includes approximately 19.2     \nmillion shares granted in March 2025 under the Sharing Success award program      \nleaving approximately 85 million shares remaining for future awards. The Board has\ndetermined to increase the shares of our common stock available for awards under  \nthe Plan by 100 million shares to enable the granting of Plan awards in the       \nfuture. The alternative would be to increase the use of deferred cash awards,     \nwhich we believe would reduce alignment with shareholder interests. Therefore, the\nBoard recommends the amendment and restatement to increase the number of shares of\ncommon stock available for awards under the Plan. In addition, the company has and\ncontinues to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount at least equal to the \nvalue of stock-settled equity awards as they are recognized into capital. These   \nshare repurchases offset the net new shares of common stock delivered under the   \nBACEP. The company currently intends to continue this repurchase practice. The    \ncompany\u2019s common stock repurchases are subject to required regulatory review and  \nBoard approval. The additional 100 million shares to be authorized under the BACEP\nwould allow our company to continue current grant practices for approximately one \nyear. Overview of the amendment and restatement The following is a summary of the \nmaterial terms of the proposed amendment and restatement and is qualified, in its \nentirety, by reference to the terms of the BACEP. A copy of the BACEP, approved by\nthe Board in March 2025, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. There \nare no proposed changes to the shareholder-friendly design features of the Plan,  \nsummarized on page 82, except that the proposed amendment and restatement adds a  \nnew annual award limit for non-employee directors. The proposed amendment and     \nrestatement will become effective only if the BACEP is approved by our            \nshareholders. Number of shares The BACEP, as last approved by shareholders in     \n2024, provides that the aggregate number of shares of our common stock available  \nfor grants of awards under the Plan from and after January 1, 2015 will not exceed\nthe sum of (i) 450 million shares, plus (ii) any shares that were subject to an   \naward as of December 31, 2014 under the BACEP, if such award is canceled,         \nterminates, expires, lapses or is settled in cash for any reason from and after   \nJanuary 1, 2015, plus (iii) effective upon April 24, 2019, 150 million shares,    \nplus (iv) effective upon April 20, 2021, 115 million shares, plus (v) effective   \nupon April 25, 2023, 75 million shares, plus (vi) effective upon April 24, 2024,  \n100 million shares. As of March 3, 2025, there were approximately 85 million      \ncommon shares available for future awards under the BACEP. The amendment and      \nrestatement, if approved by shareholders, would increase the number of shares     \navailable for awards by 100 million shares, to approximately 185 million shares   \nestimated based on information available on March 3, 2025. Under the BACEP, each  \naward, whether granted as a stock option, SAR, restricted stock share or RSU,     \ncounts against the available share pool as one share for each share awarded. The  \nshare re-useprovisions under the BACEP do not include any \u201cliberal share counting\u201d\nfeatures for stock options or SARs. Shares used to cover the exercise price of    \nstock options or to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection with      \nawards of stock options or SARs will continue to be unavailable for awards under  \nthe BACEP. In addition, the total number of shares covering stock-settled SARs or \nnet-settledoptions will be counted against the pool of available shares, not just \nthe net shares issued upon exercise. The BACEP does allow shares withheld to cover\nany                                                                               \n                         \n  84    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \ntax withholding obligations in connection with awards of restricted stock or RSUs \nto again be available for future awards under the BACEP. Shares covered by awards \nwill also continue to be available for awards if and to the extent (a) the award  \nis canceled or forfeited or (b) the award is settled in cash. Administration The  \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee (Committee) administers the BACEP. To the\nextent permitted by law, the Committee may designate an individual or committee   \n(which need not consist of directors) to act as the appropriate committee under   \nthe BACEP for granting awards to employees who are not \u201cofficers\u201d under Section 16\nof the Exchange Act. Under the BACEP, the Committee has authority with respect to \nthe following:                                                                    \n                                                                           \n  \u2022    the selection of the employees to receive awards from time to time  \n                                                                           \n                                                           \n  \u2022    the granting of awards in amounts as it determines  \n                                                           \n                                                                                \n  \u2022    the imposition of limitations, restrictions, and conditions upon awards  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n  \u2022    the certification of the attainment of performance goals, if applicable  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n       the interpretation of the BACEP and the adoption, amendment and            \n  \u2022    rescission of administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations    \n       relating to the BACEP                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    the correction of any defect or omission or reconciliation of any          \n       inconsistency in the BACEP or any award granted under the BACEP            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       the making of all other determinations and taking of all other actions     \n  \u2022    necessary or advisable for the implementation and administration of the    \n       BACEP                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Board will continue to administer grants of restricted stock under the BACEP  \nto non-employeedirectors. Eligibility Employees of Bank of America and its        \nsubsidiaries may participate in the BACEP, as selected by the Committee. Eligible \nemployees are those employees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries who have    \nmade, or are expected to make, important contributions to our business, as        \ndetermined by the Committee, including persons employed outside the United States.\nApproximately 196,000 employees are expected to be eligible to participate.       \nHowever, as mentioned above, the Committee in its discretion selects which        \nemployees will receive any awards. The BACEP also provides for awards of          \nrestricted stock to non-employeedirectors as part of our director compensation    \nprogram. All 13 of the non-employeedirectors nominated for election at the annual \nmeeting are eligible to receive these restricted stock awards. As noted elsewhere \nin this proxy statement, as part of our director compensation program, our Board  \ngrants restricted stock to directors on the day of their election or appointment  \nas a director. Any director nominee that receives at least a majority of votes    \ncast at the annual meeting will be elected at the annual meeting and will be      \neligible to receive the restricted stock award as part of their 2025-2026 director\ncompensation. In the event this proposed amendment and restatement does not       \nreceive at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, and the      \namendment and restatement does not become effective, there are enough common      \nshares remaining for issuance to grant directors elected at the annual meeting the\n2025-2026 restricted stock award. Types of awards The BACEP permits awards of     \nstock options, SARs, restricted stock shares and RSUs to employees and restricted \nstock shares to non-employeedirectors, all of which are described in more detail  \nbelow. Awards of stock options and SARs. The BACEP provides for the grant of      \noptions to purchase shares of our common stock at option prices which are not less\nthan the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the close of business\non the date of grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of \nMarch 3, 2025, was $45.56.) The BACEP also provides for the grant of SARs to      \nemployees. SARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares \nof our common stock or a combination of the two, as the Committee in its          \ndiscretion may determine, with a value equal to the difference between: (i) the   \nfair market value on the exercise date of the shares with respect to which a SAR  \nis exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.  \nAwards of options under the BACEP, which may be either incentive stock options    \n(which qualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock options, are      \ndetermined by the Committee. No more than an aggregate of 450 million shares may  \nbe awarded as incentive stock options under the BACEP. The terms and conditions of\neach option and SAR are to be determined by the Committee (or its designees) at   \nthe time of grant. Options and SARs granted under the BACEP will expire not more  \nthan 10 years from the date of grant, and the award agreements entered into with  \neach participant will specify the extent to which options and SARs may be         \nexercised during their respective terms, including in the event of the            \nparticipant\u2019s death, disability, or termination of employment.                    \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    85  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nThe BACEP includes two additional limitations on stock option and SAR grants.     \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The BACEP expressly prohibits dividend equivalents with respect to stock   \n       options and SARs.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, the BACEP prohibits the   \n       sale, transfer, pledge, assignment, or other alienation or hypothecation   \n  \u2022    (including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the         \n       foregoing restrictions, third-party financial institutions) of             \n       nonqualified stock options and SARS.                                       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board has not granted stock options or SARs since 2008. Awards of restricted  \nstock shares and RSUs. Under the BACEP, the Committee may award employees         \nrestricted shares of our common stock or RSUs which represent the right to receive\nshares of our common stock (or cash equal to the fair market value of those       \nshares). Each award agreement will contain the terms of the award, including any  \napplicable conditions, which may include continued service of the participant, the\nattainment of specified performance goals or any other conditions deemed          \nappropriate by the Committee. Restricted stock shares will be held in our custody \nuntil the applicable restrictions have been satisfied. The participant cannot     \nsell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise alienate or hypothecate (including   \nto, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing restrictions,   \nthird-party financial institutions) restricted stock shares until the applicable  \nrestrictions are satisfied. Once the restrictions are satisfied, the shares will  \nbe delivered to the participant\u2019s account, free of restrictions. During the period\nof restriction, the participant may exercise full voting rights with respect to   \nthe restricted stock shares. The award agreement for any RSUs will specify whether\nunits that become earned and payable will be settled in shares of our common stock\n(with one share of common stock to be delivered for each earned and payable RSU), \nin cash (equal to the aggregate fair market value of the RSUs that are earned and \npayable), or in a combination of shares and cash. Shares of our common stock used \nto pay earned RSUs may have additional restrictions, as determined by the         \nCommittee. The BACEP also provides for awards of restricted stock shares to our   \nnon-employeedirectors as part of our director compensation program. The amended   \nand restated BACEP, if approved by shareholders, limits the maximum number of     \nshares subject to awards granted to a non-employeedirector in a calendar year,    \ntogether with any cash fees paid during the calendar year to that director, to $1 \nmillion in total value, excluding charitable or in memoriamdonations made by the  \ncompany and fees paid, at the Board\u2019s discretion, for service on any special      \npurpose committee or for any other specific service. Some of our directors serve  \non boards of directors of our subsidiaries, for which service they are compensated\nin cash. The proposed amendment would include those fees in calculating the annual\ncompensation limit. Director stock awards vest one year after the date of grant   \nor, if earlier, at the date of the next annual meeting. However, awards that are  \nscheduled to vest in less than 50 weeks after the date of grant will count against\nthe 5% exception pool for the minimum vesting requirements described below. The   \nawards vest earlier in case of death or a change in control. If a non-            \nemployeedirector retires before the one-yearvesting date, a prorated amount of the\naward vests based on the number of days the non-employeedirector served during the\nvesting period before retirement. Awards may be deferred under the Bank of America\nCorporation Director Deferral Plan. See \u201cDirector compensation\u201d on page 44 for    \nadditional details about our director compensation program. Subject to the terms  \nof the BACEP and any applicable award agreement, a participant may be entitled to \nreceive dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to an award of restricted  \nstock or RSUs. Dividends or dividend equivalents may be credited as cash or as    \nadditional shares or units. However, in no event will dividends or dividend       \nequivalents vest or otherwise be paid out prior to the time that the underlying   \naward (or portion thereof) has vested and, accordingly, any such dividends or     \ndividend equivalents will be subject to cancellation and forfeiture if the        \nunderlying award does not vest (including both time-based and performance-based   \nawards). Minimum vesting conditions The BACEP provides that generally all stock-  \nsettled awards will vest no more quickly than ratably annually as of each         \nanniversary over a three- year period beginning on the grant date of the award.   \nThis requirement does not apply to (i) certain substitute awards arising from     \nacquisitions; (ii) shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash incentive awards;\n(iii) awards to non-employeedirectors that vest on the earlier of the one-        \nyearanniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of shareholders   \n(but not sooner than 50 weeks after the grant date); or (iv) awards that vest     \nbased on the achievement of performance goals over a period of at least one year. \nAlso, the Committee may grant equity-based awards without regard to the minimum   \nvesting requirement with respect to a maximum of 5% of the available share reserve\nauthorized for issuance under the BACEP. In addition, the minimum vesting         \nrequirement does not apply to the Committee\u2019s discretion to provide for           \naccelerated exercisability or vesting of any award, including in cases of         \nretirement, workforce reduction, death, disability, or a change in control, in the\nterms of the award or otherwise. Section 162(m) award limits Prior to 2018, awards\nunder the BACEP could be designed to qualify as \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d  \nthat were intended to be exempt from the deduction limits under Section 162(m) of \nthe Code. Under the pre-2018Section 162(m) rules, the plan under which awards were\ngranted had to include certain shareholder-approved individual award limits in    \norder for awards to qualify as performance-based compensation. The BACEP included \nsuch individual award limits, which were limited to options/SARs and performance- \nbased restricted stock and RSU awards that were intended to qualify for the       \nSection 162(m) performance-based compensation exception. Although changes in the  \nU.S. tax laws made                                                                \n                         \n  86    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nby the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the \u201cperformance-based            \ncompensation\u201d exception for grants made from and after January 1, 2018, the BACEP \ncontinues to include award limits, by which a participant may not be granted in   \nany calendar year: (i) stock options or SARs for more than 4,000,000 shares, or   \n(ii) performance-based restricted stock shares/RSUs for more than 4,000,000 shares\n(assuming maximum performance). Withholding for payment of taxes The BACEP        \nprovides for the withholding and payment by a participant of any payroll or       \nwithholding taxes required by applicable law. The BACEP permits a participant to  \nsatisfy this requirement, with the approval of the Committee and subject to the   \nterms of the BACEP, by withholding from the participant a number of shares of the \ncompany\u2019s common stock otherwise issuable under the award having a fair market    \nvalue equal to the amount of applicable payroll and withholding taxes. It also    \npermits the company and the participant to withhold at rates up to the maximum    \nstatutory tax rates. Adjustments for changes in capitalization In the event of any\nchange in the number of our outstanding shares of common stock by reason of any   \nstock dividend, split, spin-off,recapitalization, merger, consolidation,          \ncombination, exchange of shares or otherwise, the aggregate number of shares of   \nour common stock with respect to which awards may be made under the BACEP, the    \nannual limit on individual awards, the limits on incentive stock options,         \nrestricted stock and RSUs, and the terms, types of shares and number of shares of \nany outstanding awards under the BACEP will be equitably adjusted by the Committee\nin its discretion to preserve the benefit of the award for us and the participant.\nNo single trigger vesting upon a change in control for employees The BACEP permits\nthe Committee to provide for vesting of awards to employees in connection with a  \nchange in control of Bank of America if there is also a termination of employment \nin connection with the change in control. This is often referred to as \u201cdouble    \ntrigger\u201d vesting. For these purposes, a termination is considered to be in        \nconnection with a change in control if it occurs upon or within two years after   \nthe change in control and is for one of the following two reasons: (i) an         \ninvoluntary termination by the company without \u201ccause\u201d or (ii) a termination by   \nthe employee for \u201cgood reason.\u201d \u201cCause\u201d and \u201cgood reason\u201d will be as defined in   \nthe applicable award agreements. In addition, the Committee may provide for the   \nassumption or substitution of awards by a surviving corporation. Awards to non-   \nemployeedirectors fully vest upon a change in control. Amendment and termination  \nof the Plan Our Board has the power to amend, modify, or terminate the BACEP on a \nprospective basis, provided that no termination, amendment, or modification shall \nadversely affect in any material way any award previously granted under the Plan  \nwithout the written consent of any affected participant. Shareholder approval will\nbe obtained for any change to the material terms of the BACEP to the extent       \nrequired by NYSE listing requirements or other applicable law. The BACEP, as      \namended, automatically terminates at the close of business on April 21, 2035,     \nfollowing which no awards may be made under the BACEP. Option and SARs repricing  \nprohibited The BACEP specifically prohibits the repricing of stock options or SARs\nwithout shareholder approval. For this purpose, a \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the    \nfollowing (or any other action that has the same effect as any of the following): \n(i) changing the terms of a stock option or SAR to lower its exercise price; (ii) \nany other action that is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted        \naccounting principles; and (iii) repurchasing for cash or canceling a stock option\nor SAR at a time when its exercise price is greater than the fair market value of \nthe underlying stock in exchange for another award, unless the cancellation and   \nexchange occurs in connection with change in capitalization or similar change.    \nSuch cancellation and exchange would be considered a \u201crepricing\u201d regardless of    \nwhether it is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting        \nprinciples and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the employee. \nFederal income tax treatment The following discussion summarizes certain U.S.     \nfederal income tax consequences of awards under the BACEP based on the law as in  \neffect on the date of this document. The following discussion does not purport to \ncover federal employment taxes or other federal tax consequences that may be      \nemployed with awards, nor does it cover state, local, or non-U.S.taxes.           \nNonqualified stock options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable    \nincome upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option with an exercise  \nprice at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of  \ngrant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a nonqualified     \nstock option, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as      \nordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value\nof the shares underlying the stock option on the date of exercise and the exercise\nprice of the stock option. When a participant sells the shares, the participant   \nwill have short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal \nto the difference between the amount the participant received from the sale and   \nthe tax basis of the shares sold. The tax basis of the shares generally will be   \nequal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date.                \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    87  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nIncentive stock options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income\nupon the grant of an incentive stock option. If a participant exercises an        \nincentive stock option during employment or within three months after employment  \nends (12 months in the case of permanent and total disability), the participant   \nwill not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes (although the participant generally will have taxable income  \nfor alternative minimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option were a   \nnonqualified stock option). If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the   \nshares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option after the later of (a) \none year from the date the participant exercised the option and (b) two years from\nthe grant date of the stock option, the participant generally will recognize long-\nterm capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the          \nparticipant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock       \noption. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon      \nexercise of an incentive stock option before these holding period requirements are\nsatisfied, the disposition will constitute a \u201cdisqualifying disposition,\u201d and the \nparticipant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of       \ndisposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date\nof exercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or, if less, the excess  \nof the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of\nthe stock option). The balance of the participant\u2019s gain on a disqualifying       \ndisposition, if any, will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain, as the\ncase may be. With respect to both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock  \noptions, special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already \nheld by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon  \nexercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by   \nthe participant. Stock appreciation rights. A participant generally will not      \nrecognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at \nleast equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and \nno additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a SAR, a participant         \ngenerally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount     \nequal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the\nSAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of the SAR. Restricted stock      \nshares and RSUs. A participant generally will not have taxable income upon the    \ngrant of restricted stock or RSUs. Instead, the participant will recognize        \nordinary income at the time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value   \n(on the vesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount   \npaid. For restricted stock only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at   \nthe time of grant. Tax consequences to Bank of America. In the foregoing cases, we\ngenerally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same       \namount, as a participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to certain           \nlimitations imposed under the Code, including those imposed by Section 162(m) as  \napplicable. New stock plan benefits Because awards under the BACEP are            \ndiscretionary, awards are generally not determinable at this time.

We recognize that the submission\nof proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement is one mechanism for            \nshareholders to convey their priorities, perspectives, and concerns to us. We     \nencourage shareholders contemplating a shareholder proposal submission to reach   \nout to us beforehand. This allows us to better understand their perspective and   \nobjectives, to brief management and the Board or its committees on the input we   \nreceive, and to share or direct shareholders to information on our existing       \npolicies, practices, and initiatives. For additional information regarding our    \nactive shareholder engagement program, see \u201cShareholder engagement\u201d on page 36,   \nand for more information on the shareholder proposal process, see \u201cShareholder    \nproposals for our 2026 annual meeting\u201d on page 100. When we receive a shareholder \nproposal, we carefully review and discuss it with internal subject matter experts \nwho have familiarity and insight on the matters raised by the proposal, and we    \nreview the proposal with management and the Board. We also seek engagement with   \nshareholder proponents or their representatives. The shareholder proposals this   \nyear either (1) seek changes to our corporate governance practices or (2) seek    \nchanges to or reports on how we conduct our business. In the first category is a  \nproposal advocating a novel corporate governance practice that we believe is      \narbitrary, fails to recognize the robust governance policies and practices already\nin place at our company, and is not in shareholders\u2019 best interests. The remaining\nproposals seek changes to or reports on how we conduct our business. We appreciate\nthe issues raised in many of the proposals, and in some cases, have already taken \nactions to address them, including providing extensive public disclosures on the  \nspecific subject matter raised in the proposals. Where we have not already        \nimplemented the changes or prepared the requested reports, we consider their      \nusefulness to shareholders, the costs involved, and the potential conflicts of    \nsuch requests with our existing practices and disclosures. Similarly, we may      \nreceive multiple proposals on a common topic, where implementation of all the     \ndistinct (and sometimes contradictory) proposals would conflict with our existing \ninitiatives, commitments and reporting processes, or would be redundant, create   \nconfusion, and impede our progress on Responsible Growth, which would not be a    \nproductive use of corporate assets. Finally, it is important to note that a number\nof shareholder proposals below contain claims that we believe are incorrect or    \nmisleading, although we have not attempted to refute all of them. For the reasons \ndescribed below, our Board recommends a vote AGAINST each shareholder proposal.   \nProposal 5: Shareholder proposal requesting the nomination of more director       \ncandidates than board seats Jing Zhao, 1745 Copperleaf Court, Concord, CA 94519,  \nthe beneficial owner of 100 shares of the company\u2019s common stock, has advised us  \nthat he intends to present the following proposal. Shareholder Proposal on        \nDemocratic Reform of the Board Election Resolved: shareholders recommend that Bank\nof America Corporation (the Company) reform the election of the board to list more\ncandidates than the number of directors of the board to be elected. Supporting    \nStatement The American corporate boards and executives have become a class of     \noligarchy, as defined by Aristotle, according to his _Politics_. In this great    \nclassic, Aristotle demonstrated that in a stable community (polis), the ratio of  \nthe richest citizen\u2019s land to the poorest citizen\u2019s land should not be over 5 to  \n1. The Company\u2019s CEO pay ratio was 230:1 in 2023 (2024 Proxy Statement p.85). The \nCEO pay ratios of big Japanese and European companies are much less than of big   \nAmerican companies. America\u2019s ballooning executive compensation is not sustainable\nfor the economy, particularly there is no rational methodology to decide the      \nexecutive compensation. The increase of disparity of wealth is the most serious   \nroot of American social disorder. Shareholders in JPMorgan Chase & Co., Intel,    \nNetflix, Salesforce and other big companies rejected sky-highexecutive pay        \npackages in 2022, 2023, and 2024. One of the main problems of corporate governance\nis that American corporate boards are not democratically elected. The Company\u2019s   \nboard needs a democratic reform to elect members from more diversified candidates.\nShareholders should have the right to choose from more candidates than the number \nof directors of the board to be elected.                                          \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    89  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Proposals\u00a05\u20138:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                        \nThis democratic reform proposal should be implemented as not to violate any       \ncontractual obligations, with amendments to the Company\u2019s governing documents as  \nneeded. The board has the flexibility to implement this proposal to design the    \ncriteria and process to nominate at least one more candidate than the number of   \ndirectors of the board to be elected. * * *                                       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 5 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       The Board\u2019s current director selection process is effective in             \n  \u2022    identifying and evaluating highly qualified candidates for nomination and  \n       election to the Board.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Arbitrarily adopting and imposing a framework under which the pool of      \n  \u2022    candidates is larger than the number of available Board seats could        \n       significantly undermine the Board\u2019s effectiveness.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Our shareholders already have the ability to provide input on our          \n       director evaluation and nomination process.                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The Board has a robust and stringent director resignation policy in        \n  \u2022    support of our majority voting standard that provides meaningful           \n       accountability to shareholders.                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe Board \u2019 s current director selection process is effective in identifying and  \nevaluating highly qualified candidates for nomination and election to the Board.  \nOur Board believes that its director selection process is effective and preferable\nto the unconventional approach requested by this proposal. Our Board does not     \nbelieve nominating more candidates than available Board seats would be more       \neffective in ensuring that highly qualified candidates are elected to our Board\u2014as\ndescribed below, we believe it would have the opposite effect. The Board regularly\nreviews its composition, and through its Corporate Governance Committee identifies\nand recommends director candidates for nomination using a selection process that  \nreflects best practices and that has been reviewed with our primary bank          \nregulators. As described in the \u201cIdentifying and evaluating director candidates\u201d  \nsection on page 7, the Board considers the experiences, skills, and expertise of a\ncandidate that are critical to the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight \nand directly relevant to our business, strategy, and operations; diversity of     \nthought, perspective, and experience; a candidate\u2019s ability to devote the time    \nnecessary to discharge their duties as a director; and other factors, including   \nage and tenure to support continuity and achieve a balance of perspectives between\nnewer and longer-serving directors. As a result of this well-considered and       \nestablished selection process, our Board and director nominee slate comprise      \ndirectors who bring diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, varying tenures, and a    \nbroad range of skills and experiences that are directly relevant to our business, \nstrategy, and operations, and critical to the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective\noversight of the company. Arbitrarily adopting and imposing a framework under     \nwhich the pool of candidates is larger than the number of available Board seats   \ncould significantly undermine the Board \u2019 s effectiveness.We believe adoption of  \nthe framework requested by the proposal would result in decreased interest in     \nserving on our Board, significant director turnover, and less assurance that our  \nBoard composition reflects the broad range of skills and experiences that are     \ncritical to the Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight. In addition,      \ncreating an environment where nominees are competing for election to the Board    \nwould severely undermine the effectiveness of the Board by eroding the collegial  \nand collaborative dynamic that promotes open discussion and debate, values        \nindependent judgment, and emphasizes accountability. It would also deter many     \ntalented candidates who prefer to serve on a board with a director selection      \nprocess consistent with market practices. Finally, the Board and its Corporate    \nGovernance Committee devote significant time and resources to identify, evaluate, \nand nominate highly qualified candidates to the Board, as well as assessing       \ncandidates\u2019 ability to complement and reinforce the skills and experience         \ndesirable for the Board as a whole. Introducing a process wherein the Board must  \nidentify and evaluate additional candidates, some of whom will not ultimately be  \nelected, would be burdensome and inefficient, and take the Board\u2019s focus away from\nother critical areas. Our shareholders already have the ability to provide input  \non our director evaluation and nomination process. Through our year-round, Board- \ndriven shareholder engagement program described in the \u201cShareholder engagement\u201d   \nsection on page 36, our shareholders have multiple opportunities to meet with our \nindependent directors, including our Board\u2019s Lead Independent Director, to provide\ndirect input on our corporate governance practices, including Board composition   \nand succession planning. This engagement informs and contributes to enhancements  \nthat reflect the issues our shareholders tell us matter most to them. In addition,\nshareholders have the right to nominate candidates for election to our Board under\nour Bylaws, which would achieve the goal sought by this proposal ( i.e., the      \nnomination of more candidates than available directorships). Our company was one  \nof the first to adopt a proxy access Bylaw provision. This provision allows       \nshareholders owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock, including groups  \nof up to 20 shareholders who collectively own 3% or more of our outstanding stock,\nthe right to nominate director candidates constituting up to 20% of our Board, and\nto solicit votes for those candidates using our proxy materials. The Board has a  \nrobust and stringent director resignation policy in support of our majority voting\nstandard that provides meaningful accountability to shareholders.We have adopted a\nmajority voting standard for uncontested director elections under which a         \ncandidate must receive support from the majority of votes cast. Under our         \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, the Board may only nominate candidates who submit\nirrevocable resignations that will be effective if the candidate fails to receive \nthe required majority vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting. Under this director   \nresignation policy, the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the      \nresignation offer and makes a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept \nor reject the tendered resignation, or take other action. The Board then acts on  \nthe                                                                               \n                         \n  90    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Proposals\u00a05\u20138:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                        \ntendered resignation, and must promptly disclose its decision regarding the       \nresignation and the basis for its decision in a Current Report on Form 8-K.A      \ndirector whose resignation is under consideration must abstain from participating \nin any recommendation or decision regarding that resignation. Should the Board    \ndetermine, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties as required under Delaware     \ncorporate law, to not accept the resignation, the director may continue to        \nserve\u2014but only until our next annual meeting of shareholders at the latest. Under \nour policy, the Board is not permitted to nominate such director to stand for re- \nelectionat the next annual meeting of shareholders. We believe the Board\u2019s well-  \nconsidered director selection process, together with its robust director          \nresignation policy and multiple avenues for shareholders to provide input on the  \ncomposition of our Board, result in a highly qualified Board that is well-        \npositioned to provide effective oversight and that is accountable to shareholders.\nChanging this framework in favor of an arbitrary and highly unconventional        \ndirector election scheme is unnecessary and would not be in the best interests of \nshareholders.                                                                     \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 5).                         \n                                                      \nProposal 6: Shareholder proposal requesting report on board oversight of risks    \nrelated to animal welfare John C. Harrington, President and CEO of Harrington     \nInvestments, Inc., 1001 2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, CA 94559, the beneficial     \nowner of 600 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, has advised us that it intends \nto present the following resolution: Whereas:Animal welfare issues present        \nmaterial financial, operational, and reputational risks for companies that receive\nfinancing from Bank of America (BAC), and to BAC as their financier. Supporting   \nStatement:The risks of mismanaging animal welfare include business disruption or  \nloss of goodwill associated with inhumane treatment of animals such as animal     \ntesting and conditions of habitation, but they also may include environmental     \nimpacts of factory farming and related supply chain risks, and potential          \nliabilities associated with issues of food safety, including diseases passed from \nanimals to humans and overuse of antibiotics in livestock. 1 OpenInveststates: \u201cA \ncompany that does not disclose or prioritize its processes or impact on animal    \nwelfare raises questions for investors on how effective that company can be in    \nmanaging potential risks or opportunities down the road. It is also impossible to \nassess future risk without the disclosure of the right information.\u201d 2To minimize \nthese risks, some banks are taking animal welfare issues into account as part of  \ntheir lending due diligence practices. However, \u201canimal welfare\u201d is absent from   \nBAC\u2019s policies, governance documents, and reports. BAC\u2019s Environmental and Social \nPolicy Framework asserts \u201c\u2026recognition of the importance of biodiversity and its  \nenvironmental, cultural, religious and health contributions to societies\u201d.        \nHowever, the extent of oversight is unclear, seemingly limited to certain         \n\u201csensitive\u201d or \u201cfragile\u201d ecosystems and conditions, failing to address the welfare\nof animals involved. 3 Furthermore, recognition for biodiversity and fragile      \necosystems does not equate to consideration for animal welfare. Our Company       \nstates: \u201c Biodiversity is the third most important global risk over a             \n10-yearperiod... In fact, nature loss is intrinsically linked to climate crisis   \nand natural resource consumption, while use of land, especially for agriculture   \nand food production , is the main cause of animal and plant species extinction. It\nis therefore, without changes or investments, a major risk for ecosystem          \ndegradation and food security over the medium to long term.\u201d 4 Then, why\u2013         \naccording to American Banker \u2013 is BAC among the top financiers of factory farms,  \nresponsible for 20% of all loans and underwriting services to companies tied to   \nfactory farms?! 5 Increasingly, banks are adopting exclusionary criteria to reduce\nexposure to animal cruelty and associated risks. 6Yet BAC earns a score of \u201c0\u201d on \nBanksforAnimals.org, for apparent deficiencies in key areas regarding animal      \nwelfare. 7 Simply because a process is not disclosed does not necessarily indicate\nlack of due diligence. However, neglecting to publicly acknowledge oversight on   \nanimal welfare risks the perception of our company\u2019s failure of oversight on      \ncritical issues. Publicly disclosing how Bank of America addresses animal welfare \nwhen considering financing decisions would not only increase transparency but     \nenhance BAC\u2019s overall reputation. Resolved:Shareholders request that Bank of      \nAmerica publish a report at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary and      \nprivileged information, disclosing whether and how the Board of Directors         \nexercises oversight regarding material risks associated with animal welfare.      \n                                                                          \n  1  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-animal-welfare  \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n  2  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-animal-welfare  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n  3  https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/environmental-and-s\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  4  https://institute.bankofamerica.com/sustainability/4-sustainability-trends\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  5  https://www.americanbanker.com/news/activists-to-jpmorgan-chase-bofa-citi-\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                \n  6  https://banksforanimals.org/ranking-list/  \n                                                \n                                                                \n  7  https://banksforanimals.org/institutions/bank-of-america/  \n                                                                \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    91  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Proposals\u00a05\u20138:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                        \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 6 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       Our Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Committee oversees the management of our  \n  \u2022    sustainability practices to support Responsible Growth, and our Board\u2019s    \n       Enterprise Risk Committee oversees the risks addressed in our              \n       Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework.                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework provides robust         \n  \u2022    mechanisms for managing environmental, social and financial risks across   \n       our enterprise, including reputational risks associated with animal        \n       welfare issues.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       In light of our existing policies and procedures for Board oversight of    \n  \u2022    sustainability-related risks, including risks related to animal welfare,   \n       preparation of the requested report would not provide shareholders with    \n       meaningful additional information and would waste company resources.       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Committee oversees the management of our         \nsustainability practices to support Responsible Growth, and our Board\u2019s Enterprise\nRisk Committee oversees the risks addressed in our Environmental and Social Risk  \nPolicy Framework.The Board and its Corporate Governance Committee oversee the     \ncompany\u2019s environmental and sustainability activities and practices. As part of   \nits oversight role, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews the company\u2019s      \nenvironmental and sustainability strategy, initiatives and policies, and receives \nregular reports from our management\u2019s Responsible Growth Council comprised of     \nsenior leaders across every major line of business and support function. A        \ncritical part of the Responsible Growth Council\u2019s role is to engage in ongoing    \nevaluation and development of our policies and procedures, including our          \nEnvironmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (the \u201cESRP Framework\u201d), 1which     \nprovides for enhanced due diligence of corporate and commercial financing         \nrelationships and general operations. Pursuant to federal banking regulations, our\nBoard\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee oversees our company\u2019s risk framework and risk  \nappetite statements. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Enterprise Risk       \nCommittee receives reports from management on the various types of environmental  \nand social policy risks covered by the ESRP Framework. Our Environmental and      \nSocial Risk Policy Framework provides robust mechanisms for managing              \nenvironmental, social and financial risks across our enterprise, including        \nreputational risks associated with animal welfare issues.As a global financial    \ninstitution, we manage and mitigate many kinds of risks, including those that can \narise indirectly as a result of our clients\u2019 activities. Our ESRP Framework       \narticulates how we manage and govern environmental and social risks across our    \nbusiness. Under the ESRP Framework, proposed relationships and transactions are   \nsubject to enhanced due diligence when they implicate certain key environmental or\nsocial issues. We undertake enhanced due diligence before the relationship or     \ntransaction can proceed toward approval, and the process includes a deeper        \nanalysis of issues related to client transactions and associated stakeholders. Our\nenhanced due diligence process is conducted by individuals with subject matter    \nexpertise and an understanding of a range of stakeholder perspectives, and the    \nprocess is tailored to provide a deep analysis of risk issues for specific        \ntransactions. Our ESRP Framework outlines the key environmental and social topics \nthat we recognize as being of heightened sensitivity and importance to the company\nand our stakeholders. In addition, our ESRP Framework provides that issues that   \ncould pose reputational risk to our firm, including issues related to animal      \nwelfare, are to be escalated for further evaluation. If due diligence reveals that\na business activity presents significant environmental and social risk, we have a \ngovernance framework to escalate that activity to the appropriate committee       \nresponsible for reputational risk management for further evaluation, which may    \nresult in a client relationship or transaction being exited or declined. In light \nof our existing policies and procedures for Board oversight of sustainability-    \nrelated risks, including risks related animal welfare preparation of the requested\nreport would not provide shareholders with meaningful additional information and  \nwould waste company resources.As discussed above, our Board, the Corporate        \nGovernance Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee, provide robust oversight  \nof our environmental and sustainability activities and practices across a broad   \nand diverse range of our financing operations, and the Corporate Governance       \nCommittee regularly reviews our environmental and sustainability strategy,        \ninitiatives, and policies. Our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee provides robust  \noversight of our key risks and related risk management practices, including       \nenvironment and social risks. Our ESRP Framework provides clarity and transparency\non our approach to monitoring for and addressing these risks, including how we    \nidentify, measure, monitor, and control these risks as part of our company\u2019s risk \nframework. The Board believes that the preparation and production of the requested\nreport is duplicative, unnecessary and would not add to the transparent disclosure\nabout our Board\u2019s oversight of environmental and social risks that is already     \navailable. As such, our Board believes that the disclosure requested by the       \nproposal would not be a productive use of time or company resources.              \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 6).                         \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  1  Our ESRP Framework is available at                                           \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/environmental-and-s\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  92    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Proposals\u00a05\u20138:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                        \nProposal 7: Shareholder proposal requesting report on lobbying alignment with Bank\nof America\u2019s climate goals Sada Geuss, c/o Trillium Asset Management, One Congress\nStreet, Suite 3101, Boston, MA, 02114, and other co-filershave advised us that    \nthey intend to present the resolution below. The proponent confirmed that she is  \nthe beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of the company\u2019s common   \nstock but did not provide the number of shares owned. CLIMATE LOBBYING DISCLOSURE \nAND ALIGNMENT WHEREAS:Climate change poses a systemic financial risk, potentially \nreducing global GDP by up to 19% by midcentury. 1Corporate lobbying and policy    \naction inconsistent with mitigating climate impacts and transitioning to a low    \ncarbon economy may present risks to investors and companies. Bank of America (BAC)\nrecently set three climate related goals: a 2030 financed emissions reduction     \ntarget covering heavy industry, including energy and steel; a 2050 net zero       \nfinanced emissions reduction target covering its entire lending portfolio, and a  \n2030 goal to deploy $1.5 trillion toward sustainable finance. 2 BAC notes in its  \n2024 sustainability report that achieving its goals will require collective action\nincluding by government and trade associations, and acknowledges the importance of\ndirect and indirect lobbying efforts to promote policies that will help clients   \nmeet its goal of reaching a \u201cbalanced and Just Transition to Net Zero\u201d 3 Despite  \ndisclosing some policy priorities in its 2024 report, BAC does not fully disclose \nits climate policy positions or direct lobbying activities. The bank was largely  \nsilent in public on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), critical legislation for   \nclean tech development and emissions reductions, only voicing support post-passage\nwhen citing the IRA\u2019s benefits to clean energy and corporate earnings. 4 Further  \nBAC risks reputational damage 5and fosters potential systemic risk 6by funding    \norganizations lobbying against climate legislation, contradicting its own public  \nstatements and potentially undermining achievement of its climate goals. BAC is a \nmember of industry associations opposing critical climate change policies,        \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, both of which \nopposed the IRA. 7 8 Current disclosures do not adequately inform investors how   \nBAC ensures its lobbying aligns with its climate commitments. While the bank      \nstates it shares policy positions with partners, it is unclear how it is managing \nclimate policy misalignment risks. BAC could better inform investors by publishing\nclimate lobbying alignment reports similar to those of Unilever 9and Enel 10, and \nadopt disclosure best practices found in the Global Standard on Responsible       \nClimate Lobbying. 11 RESOLVED:Shareholders request that BAC\u2019s Board of Directors  \nanalyze and report to shareholders annually (at reasonable cost and omitting      \nconfidential information) on the alignment of its lobbying and policy influence   \nactivities with its 2030 sectoral emissions reduction and 2050 net zero targets.  \nThis report should include both direct and indirect activities (through trade     \nassociations, coalitions, alliances, etc.), the climate policy activities and     \npositions analyzed, the criteria used for assessment, and any stakeholder         \ninvolvement. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: In evaluating the degree of alignment between  \nits net zero goals and its policy advocacy, BAC should disclose its lobbying      \nactions regarding climate provisions of key international, federal, and state     \nlegislation and regulation, where relevant, and not merely rely on organizational \nstatements supporting climate progress. * * *

operations, supply chain, and financing activities before 2050 .As  \ndescribed in multiple public disclosures about our sustainability-related         \nactivities and goals, including most recently our September 2024 \u201cSustainability  \nat Bank of America\u201d disclosure (the \u201c2024 Sustainability Disclosure\u201d) and our 2023\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report, 1we are helping       \nfinance the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Our efforts include setting \nand achieving milestone targets, engaging with clients to support their own       \ntransition objectives, developing and reporting on decision-useful metrics to     \ndrive progress, and providing significant transparency on our priorities and      \nprogress. Our ability to reach net zero in our operations, supply chain and       \nfinancing activity is reliant on many stakeholders, and we participate in the     \ndevelopment of policies, regulations, and partnerships that support this          \ntransition. As described in the 2024 Sustainability Disclosure, our public policy \nteam is engaged with policy makers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to help us \nunderstand and, where appropriate, work to influence potential policy changes that\ncould impact our company or clients. We also support and encourage the role       \ngovernment policymakers can play in addressing the transition-related work        \nunderway in the private sector. Independently, and working with trade associations\nand through other collaborations, we promote policies that align with the roles   \nfinancial institutions play in support of their clients in helping to finance a   \nbalanced and just transition to net zero. Given the global breadth and scale of   \nour businesses and operations, our company participates in numerous trade         \nassociations that participate in policy development on a range of topics relevant \nto our enterprise. This allows us to address the spectrum of issues that may      \nimpact our company, our clients, or the markets and economies in which we operate.\nOur membership in specific trade associations or other organizations does not mean\nthat we endorse every position or issue that these organizations may support,     \nincluding on climate-related matters. We often voice our differing view on        \nsignificant issues to such organizations and, through active engagement in these  \norganizations, we are able to share our policy positions and advocate for         \nalignment with our company\u2019s climate and emissions goals. In addition, we         \ncontinually evaluate the overall benefit of our continued memberships to assess   \nwhether they remain aligned with our commitment to Responsible Growth and continue\nto serve the overall best interests of our company and our shareholders. Our      \npolitical activities and public policy engagement are subject to comprehensive    \ngovernance, including oversight from our Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Committee.As\na global financial services company, the company is committed to participation in \nthe political process in a manner that is consistent with leading corporate       \ngovernance practices and in compliance with legal requirements. Our approach to   \npolitical involvement is guided by our Corporate Political Contributions Policy   \nStatement, which sets forth basic principles regarding our company\u2019s stance on    \npolitical contributions and activities, along with our other policies and         \nprocedures, including our Code of Conduct and Political Action Committee          \ngovernance documents. Our political activities are managed by our public policy   \nteam in partnership with our compliance group and legal counsel, and we regularly \nreview our participation in trade associations and other organizations as part of \nour public policy engagement process. Our Board\u2019s Corporate Governance Committee  \noversees this participation and regularly receives information on political       \ncontributions, major lobbying priorities, and principal trade association         \nactivities that relate to our public policy objectives. Because we already provide\nextensive disclosure about our lobbying and political activities and trade        \nassociation memberships, including related to our climate strategy and net zero   \ngoal, preparation of the requested report would not provide shareholders with     \nmeaningful additional information and would waste company resources.We already    \ndisclose our federal lobbying activities, policies and procedures for political   \nactivities and contributions on our website.Under \u201cPolitical Activities\u201d on our   \nInvestor Relations website, 2we disclose our aggregate annual federal lobbying    \nexpenses and provide links to our prior-year federal quarterly lobbying reports so\nthat the public and our shareholders can easily access reports disclosing our     \ncorporate expenditures related to lobbying and the issues on which we lobbied. We \nalso disclose our principal memberships in financial industry and certain other   \ntrade associations that receive more than $25,000 from us annually, and any       \ncontribution made to non-candidateorganizations such as organizations organized   \nunder Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code or groups organized under Section  \n501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent permitted by applicable law. \nAs discussed above, our 2024 Sustainability Disclosure describes our climate-     \nrelated advocacy and engagement.

The disclosure,\nprepared at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information, shall      \ndescribe Company\u2019s methodology, including what it classifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or   \n\u201cfossil fuel.\u201d Company should include lending in its ESR if methodologically      \nsound. Supporting Statement: As a major global bank, Company is broadly exposed to\nfinancial stability risks posed by climate change and has made certain climate-   \nrelated commitments. Banks aligning their activities with their climate goals are \nbetter prepared to manage risk, including legal, reputational and financial risks \nassociated with climate change and capitalize on opportunities associated with the\nglobal energy transition. According to the International Energy Agency, reaching  \nnet zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires rapid transition away from     \nfossil fuels and tripling in global annual clean energy investment by 2030. 1The  \npace at which low-carbonenergy supply is scaled up will dictate the rate at which \nfossil fuels are phased down. 2 Company is reportedly among the largest global    \nfinanciers of fossil fuels; however, it has committed to achieve net zero         \nemissions in its financing activities before 2050 and to a goal of mobilizing and \ndeploying $1 trillion by 2030 \u201cto accelerate the environmental transition.\u201d       \n3Although Company has robust commitments to sustainable finance, investors need   \nfurther disclosure to assess its clean energy financing activity and relative     \nfinancing of fossil fuels. The ESR, a dollar-based metric, will complement and    \nsupplement Company\u2019s existing emissions-based climate financial disclosures,      \nincluding any disclosures under European Union reporting requirements, and provide\ndecision-useful disclosure on Company\u2019s activities and progress toward its public \ncommitments. In recent years, banks reportedly earned more in lending and         \nunderwriting fees from clean energy projects than from oil and gas, and coal      \ncompanies. 4Investors seek to assess whether Company is positioning itself as a   \nleader in the energy transition. The ESR has become a key climate disclosure      \nmetric. Bloomberg provides to its clients ESRs for global banks, including        \nCompany, using a standardized methodology with clear definitions for \u2018low carbon\u2019 \nand \u2018fossil fuel,\u2019 however, it excludes lending. 5Three leading North American    \nBanks, Citi, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Canada committed to disclose an ESR, and  \ntheir methodology, demonstrating that disclosure is feasible and leading market   \npractice. Investors believe Company should similarly disclose its annual ESR for  \nwhich it is accountable, and work toward an industry-standard approach for        \ncalculating and reporting it. Bloomberg published an Implementation Guide 6and the\nInstitute of International Finance, a financial industry association with around  \n400 members globally, published a 2024 whitepaper that provides a potential format\nfor standardized disclosure of methodological design choices. 7 * * *             \n                                                                                  \n  1  https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  2  Executive summary \u2013 Net Zero Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 \u00b0C    \n     Goal in Reach \u2013 Analysis\u2014IEA                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                             \n  3  2024 Sustainability at Bank of America  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  4  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-18/green-fees-overtake-fos\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  5  https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/BNEF-Bank-Financing-Report-S\u2026  \n     _Energy-Supply-Investment-and-Bank-Facilitated-Financing-Ratios.pdf          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  6  https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Energy-Supply-Banking-Ratios\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                            \n  7  32370132_iif_white_paper_energy_supply_ratio_september_2024_final.pdf  \n                                                                            \n                              \n  2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement    95  \n                              \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                        \n  Proposals\u00a05\u20138:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                        \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 8 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       We have devoted significant resources to developing and implementing a     \n  \u2022    methodical and holistic strategy to track and publicly disclose our        \n       progress in promoting the clean energy transition.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Third parties already calculate and disclose energy supply finance ratios  \n  \u2022    for global banks that provide shareholders and other stakeholders with     \n       uniform and comparable metrics.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Development and disclosure of the requested energy supply ratio would      \n  \u2022    require significant company resources and divert management attention      \n       from its important work delivering on our climate strategy.                \n                                                                                  \nWe have devoted significant resources to developing and implementing a methodical \nand holistic strategy to track and publicly disclose our progress in promoting the\nclean energy transition.As detailed in our Sustainability at Bank of America      \ndisclosure published in 2024 (the \u201c2024 Sustainability Disclosure\u201d), 1we have a   \nthree-pronged climate strategy: minimizing our own impact on the environment;     \nsupporting and enabling our clients to achieve their respective climate           \nstrategies; and assessing and managing climate-related risks. We support low-     \ncarbonenergy sources through our lending, investments, products, and services, and\nwe have developed innovative financing solutions that support the clean energy    \ntransition, including new and emerging clean energy technologies. And we recognize\nthe importance of disclosing decision-useful metrics to help shareholders and     \nother stakeholders track our progress towards our emissions reduction goals. As   \ndisclosed in the 2024 Sustainability Disclosure, in recent years, we have set     \nadditional 2030 targets for reducing emissions associated with our financing      \nactivity (\u201cfinanced emissions\u201d) in the aviation and cement sectors and added      \ntargets for the maritime shipping and iron and steel sectors. These new targets   \nsupplement the financed emissions targets we set in 2022 related to auto          \nmanufacturing, energy and power generation. Our 2023 Task Force on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) Report 2provides additional details about the well \naccepted frameworks we have used to develop and report on our financed emissions  \nand other goals. Our 2024 Sustainability Disclosure, together with our 2023 TCFD  \nReport and other public disclosures, articulate a comprehensive and pragmatic     \nstrategy for how we support the transition across economic sectors and provide our\nshareholders with the ability to readily track and assess our progress. Third     \nparties already calculate and disclose energy supply finance ratios for global    \nbanks that provide shareholders and other stakeholders with uniform and comparable\nmetrics.As part of our commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, we\nare transparent about our well-considered and pragmatic strategy for supporting   \nthe transition of our energy and power systems clients toward a low-carbonfuture, \nand we publicly discuss our strategy and progress in many public disclosures,     \nincluding our 2024 Sustainability Disclosure. To address any interest in          \nadditional metrics on bank financing activities, third parties such as Bloomberg  \nalready have developed proprietary methodologies to calculate energy supply       \nfinance ratios and similar information for global banks that are readily          \navailable. The report referenced in the proposal, BloombergNEF\u2019s Third Annual     \nEnergy Supply Investment and Banking Ratios, for example, already discloses an    \nestimated energy supply finance ratio for our company\u2014exactly the type of ratio   \nthat the proposal asks us to disclose. While some banks have independently made   \ncommitments to calculate and disclose their own energy supply ratio, we do not    \nbelieve an approach that encourages individual banks to develop their own         \nmethodologies to calculate and disclose their own ratios will provide shareholders\nand other stakeholders with readily comparable and decision-useful information.   \nThis has been borne out in the initial actions of the other banks that have begun \nto provide their own methodologies, and we have heard from shareholders and others\nthat they are now confronted with individual company-calculated ratios based on   \ndifferent data sources and methodologies with little comparability or utility.    \nSuch a patchwork of disclosures is only making it more challenging for            \nshareholders to gauge each bank\u2019s progress toward achieving its own clean energy  \ngoals or to compare such progress among banks. Development and disclosure of the  \nrequested energy supply ratio would require significant company resources and     \ndivert management attention from its important work delivering on our climate     \nstrategy.As demonstrated by our extensive and detailed reporting in our 2024      \nSustainability Disclosure, the process for setting financed emissions goals and   \nreporting our progress on them is complex, requiring an extensive amount of data  \ncollection, research and ongoing assessment of, and reliance on, workable and     \ntransparent guidelines and frameworks. Because, as the proposal acknowledges,     \nthere is no generally accepted methodology for calculating the energy supply ratio\nrequested by the proposal, we would need to make numerous design decisions,       \nincluding regarding the appropriate definition of carbon energy and fuel supply,  \nappropriate adjustment factors for individual clients, specific data sources to   \nuse, scope of financial products and asset classes to be included and various     \nother matters. We also would need to develop and implement new reporting systems  \nfor gathering, testing, and tracking those data points. Such an extensive and     \ntime-consuming undertaking would require the company to expend significant company\nresources and, for the reasons addressed above, would not provide our shareholders\nwith comparable and decision-useful information about our progress toward our     \ngoals. Accordingly, our Board believes that the disclosure requested by the       \nproposal would not be a productive use of time or effort and would not provide our\nshareholders with meaningful additional information.                              \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 8).                         \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  1  Our 2024 Sustainability Disclosure is available at                           \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/report-center/esg/2024/S\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Our 2023 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report   \n  2  is available at                                                              \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/report-center/esg/2023/2\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  96    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                \n  Voting\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0information  \n                                \nVoting, attending the annual meeting, and other information Voting Who may vote at\nthe annual meeting?

In addition,  \n       you may vote by internet or phone no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern time    \n  \u2022    on April\u00a021, 2025.                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Beneficial shareholders.

Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not      \n       treated as votes cast and are not counted for purposes of determining the  \n  \u2022    election of directors. If a nominee does not receive the required votes    \n       for election at our annual meeting, our Board, with the assistance of our  \n       Corporate Governance Committee, will consider whether to accept the        \n       director\u2019s offer of resignation, which is required to be tendered under    \n       our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Board will publicly disclose its  \n       decision regarding the resignation and the basis for its decision within   \n       90 days after election results are certified.                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Other proposals. Approval of Proposals 2 through 8 requires the votes      \n       cast in favor of each such proposal to exceed the votes cast against the   \n  \u2022    proposal. Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not treated as  \n       votes cast and are not counted in determining the outcome of any of these  \n       proposals.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  98    Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America  \n                         \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                \n  Voting\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0information  \n                                \nWhat other information do I need to know?

Attending the annual\nmeeting Why is this year\u2019s annual meeting being held in a virtual-only format?

As with an in-personmeeting, you will be\nable to vote and ask questions during the meeting.

Return on average tangible common         \n       shareholders\u2019 equity measures our net income applicable to common          \n       shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders\u2019      \n  \u2022    equity. Tangible book value per common share represents ending tangible    \n       common shareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.   \n       These measures are used to evaluate the company\u2019s use of equity. In        \n       addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use        \n       return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to         \n       support our overall growth goals.                                          \n                                                                                  \nNon-GAAPfinancial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an         \nalternative for, our company\u2019s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. \nFor additional information about non-GAAPfinancial measures, see Supplemental     \nFinancial Data in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations on page 30 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-Kfiled  \nwith the SEC on February 25, 2025.

Establishment, Duration and    \nPurpose 1.1 Establishment and Duration of the Plan. The Company established this  \nPlan, originally known as the \u201cBank of America Corporation Key Associate Stock    \nPlan,\u201d effective as of January 1, 2003, and the Plan as originally established was\napproved by the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Plan, subsequently known as the \u201cBank \nof America Key Employee Equity Plan\u201d and now known as the \u201cBank of America        \nCorporation Equity Plan\u201d was subsequently amended or amended and restated on      \nseveral occasions, most recently with an amendment and restatement approved by the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on April 24, 2024.   \nThe Plan is hereby being further amended and restated, subject to and effective   \nupon the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders at the annual meeting of          \nstockholders on April 22, 2025. The purposes of amending and restating the Plan   \nare to (a) authorize additional Shares for Awards under the Plan, (b) extend the  \nPlan\u2019s term, and (c) add a limit on awards to Non-Employee Directors. The Plan    \nshall remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the date that no additional      \nShares are available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the date that the Plan has \nbeen terminated in accordance with Article 14 or (iii) the close of business on   \nApril 21, 2035. 1.2 Purpose of the Plan. The Company believes that the            \ncompensation of its Employees should be linked to the Company\u2019s business          \nperformance in order to enhance the long-term success and value of the Company.   \nThe Plan serves this compensation philosophy by providing a source of equity-based\nAwards for Employees that are intended to further motivate Employees to increase  \nthe value of the Company\u2019s common stock, thereby aligning the interests of the    \nEmployees with those of the Company\u2019s stockholders while maintaining an           \nappropriate balance between risk and reward. The Plan also provides the Company   \nwith a means to attract, recruit and retain Employees who will create sustainable \nresults consistent with the Company\u2019s risk management policies and strategic plan \nfor the long-term benefit of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Plan also enables the\nCompany to attract and retain persons of exceptional ability to serve as Non-     \nEmployeeDirectors and to further align the interests of Non-EmployeeDirectors and \nstockholders in enhancing the value of the Company\u2019s Shares.

The Option Price due upon exercise  \nof any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its  \nequivalent, or (b) by tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate    \nFair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option Price         \n(provided that the Shares which are tendered must have been held by the           \nParticipant for at least six (6) months prior to their tender to satisfy the      \nOption Price unless such Shares had been acquired by the Participant on the open  \nmarket), or (c) by a combination of (a) and (b). As soon as practicable after     \nnotification of exercise and full payment, the Company shall deliver the Shares to\nthe Participant in an appropriate amount based upon the number of Shares purchased\nunder the Option(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee also may allow  \n(a) cashless exercises as permitted under Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation T,   \nsubject to applicable securities law restrictions, or (b) exercises by any other  \nmeans which the Committee determines to be consistent with the Plan\u2019s purpose and \napplicable law. 6.7 Restrictions on Share Transferability. The Committee may      \nimpose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an    \nOption granted under this Article 6 as it may deem advisable, including, without  \nlimitation, restrictions under applicable Federal securities laws, under the      \nrequirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such Shares are then      \nlisted and/or traded, and under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable  \nto such Shares. 6.8 Termination of Employment. Each Participant\u2019s Option Award    \nAgreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right\nto exercise the Option following termination of the Participant\u2019s employment with \nthe Company and its Subsidiaries. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole \ndiscretion of the Committee, shall be included in the Award Agreement entered into\nwith Participants, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to this  \nArticle 6, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of   \nemployment. In that regard, if an Award Agreement permits exercise of an Option   \nfollowing the death of the Participant, the Award Agreement shall provide that    \nsuch Option shall be exercisable to the extent provided therein by any person that\nmay be empowered to do so under the Participant\u2019s will, or if the Participant     \nshall fail to make a testamentary disposition of the Option or shall have died    \nintestate, by the Participant\u2019s executor or other legal representative. 6.9       \nNontransferability of Options.

Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant\u2019s Award      \nAgreement, all NQSOs granted to a Participant under this Article 6 shall be       \nexercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant. In no event may  \nan NQSO be transferred for consideration. 6.10 No Rights.

Upon exercise of an SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive       \npayment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: (a) The          \ndifference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over  \nthe grant price; by (b) The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is     \nexercised. At the discretion of the Committee or as otherwise provided in the     \napplicable Award Agreement, the payment upon SAR exercise shall be in cash, in    \nShares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof. 7.6 Other             \nRestrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may  \nimpose such conditions on exercise of an SAR (including, without limitation, the  \nright of the Committee to limit the time of exercise to specified periods) as may \nbe required to satisfy the requirements of Section 16 (or any successor rule) of  \nthe Exchange Act or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Committee. 7.7\nTermination of Employment. Each SAR Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to \nwhich the Participant shall have the right to exercise the SAR following          \ntermination of the Participant\u2019s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.\nSuch provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall\nbe included in the Award Agreement entered into with Participants, need not be    \nuniform among all SARs issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions  \nbased on the reasons for termination of employment. In that regard, if an Award   \nAgreement permits exercise of an SAR following the death of the Participant, the  \nAward Agreement shall provide that such SAR shall be exercisable to the extent    \nprovided therein by any person that may be empowered to do so under the           \nParticipant\u2019s will, or if the Participant shall fail to make a testamentary       \ndisposition of the SAR or shall have died intestate, by the Participant\u2019s executor\nor other legal representative. 7.8 Nontransferability of SARs. Except as otherwise\nprovided in a Participant\u2019s Award Agreement, no SAR granted under the Plan may be \nsold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated      \n(including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing      \nrestrictions, third-party financial institutions), other than by will or by the   \nlaws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a      \nParticipant\u2019s Award Agreement, all SARs granted to a Participant under the Plan   \nshall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.

In the \nabsence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant\u2019s   \ndeath shall be paid to the Participant\u2019s estate.                                  \n                                \n  B-10    2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement  \n                                \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \nArticle 11. Deferrals The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such        \nParticipant\u2019s receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would \notherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR\nor the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or        \nRestricted Stock Units, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code (if   \napplicable). If any such deferral election is required or permitted, the Committee\nshall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment    \ndeferrals. Article 12. Rights of Employees 12.1 Employment. Nothing in the Plan   \nshall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any\nParticipant\u2019s employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to\ncontinue in the employ of the Company. For purposes of this Plan, a transfer of a \nParticipant\u2019s employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or between         \nSubsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment. Upon such a  \ntransfer, the Committee may make such adjustments to outstanding Awards as it     \ndeems appropriate to reflect the changed reporting relationships. 12.2            \nParticipation. No Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award\nunder this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future  \nAward or a future Award in any specified amount. Article 13. Change in Control    \n13.1 Treatment of Outstanding Awards.Unless otherwise specifically prohibited     \nunder applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing           \ngovernmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee may, in its \nsole discretion, at the time an Award is made hereunder or at any time prior to,  \ncoincident with or after the time of a Change in Control take any one or more of  \nthe following actions which shall apply only upon the occurrence of a Change in   \nControl or, if later, upon the action being taken: (a) provide for the            \nacceleration of any time periods, or the waiver of any other conditions, relating \nto the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an Award so that any Award to\na Participant whose employment has been terminated as a result of a Change in     \nControl may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a date \nfixed by the Committee, and in connection therewith the Committee may (i) provide \nfor an extended period to exercise Options (not to exceed the original Option     \nterm) and (ii) determine the level of attainment of any applicable performance    \ngoals; (b) provide for the purchase of any Awards from a Participant whose        \nemployment has been terminated as a result of a Change in Control, upon the       \nParticipant\u2019s request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have  \nbeen obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such  \nAward been currently exercisable or payable; or (c) cause the Awards then         \noutstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving  \ncorporation in such Change in Control. For purposes of sub-paragraphs(a) and (b)  \nabove, any Participant whose employment is either (i) terminated by the Company   \nother than for \u201ccause,\u201d or (ii) terminated by the Participant for \u201cgood reason\u201d   \n(each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), in either case upon, or on or\nprior to the second anniversary of, a Change in Control, shall be deemed to have  \nbeen terminated as a result of the Change in Control. 13.2 Limitation on Change-  \nin-ControlBenefits. It is the intention of the Company and the Participants to    \nreduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder if the     \naggregate Net After Tax Receipts (as defined below) to the Participant would      \nthereby be increased, as a result of the application of the excise tax provisions \nof Section 4999 of the Code. Accordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary   \nnotwithstanding, in the event that the certified public accountants regularly     \nemployed by the Company immediately prior to any \u201cchange\u201d described below (the    \n\u201cAccounting Firm\u201d) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below)\nwould subject the Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall     \ndetermine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a \u201cReduced \nAmount\u201d (as defined below). If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a     \nReduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount in \naccordance with the provisions of Section 13.2(b) below. (a) For purposes of this \nSection 13.2(a): (i) A \u201cPayment\u201d shall mean any payment or distribution in the    \nnature of compensation to or for the benefit of a Participant who is a            \n\u201cdisqualified individual\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and   \nwhich is contingent on a \u201cchange\u201d described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the    \nCode with respect to the Company, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or\notherwise; (ii) \u201cPlan Payment\u201d shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to   \nthis Plan (disregarding this Section 13.2);                                       \n                           \n  Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America    B-11  \n                           \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \n(iii) \u201cNet After Tax Receipt\u201d shall mean the Present Value of a Payment, net of   \nall taxes imposed on the Participant with respect thereto under Sections 1 and    \n4999 of the Code, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1\nof the Code which applied to the Participant\u2019s Federal taxable income for the     \nimmediately preceding taxable year; (iv) \u201cPresent Value\u201d shall mean such value    \ndetermined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code; and (v) \u201cReduced    \nAmount\u201d shall mean the smallest aggregate amount of Payments which (A) is less    \nthan the sum of all Payments and (B) results in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts  \nwhich are equal to or greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result  \nif all Payments were paid to or for the benefit of the Participant. (b) If the    \nAccounting Firm determines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the       \nReduced Amount, the Committee shall promptly give the Participant notice to that  \neffect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. The Company shall reduce or\neliminate the Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the       \nPayments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash   \npayments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which \nare to be paid the farthest in time from the determination, all as determined by  \nthe Accounting Firm. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this    \nSection 13.2 shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be   \nmade within sixty (60) days immediately following the event constituting the      \n\u201cchange\u201d referred to above. As promptly as practicable following such             \ndetermination, the Company shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the      \nParticipant such Payments as are then due to the Participant under this Plan. (c) \nAt the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is  \npossible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for \nthe benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so\npaid or distributed (\u201cOverpayment\u201d) or that additional amounts which will have not\nbeen paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant  \npursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed (\u201cUnderpayment\u201d), in \neach case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the\nevent that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by\nthe Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant which the     \nAccounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling         \nprecedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been \nmade, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the       \nbenefit of the Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio  \nto the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the Company together with \ninterest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the \nCode; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and  \nno amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and to the extent \n(i) such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the  \nParticipant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or     \ngenerate a refund of such taxes or (ii) the Participant is subject to the         \nprohibition on personal loans under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other  \nsubstantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such     \nUnderpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the   \nParticipant together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in \nSection 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 13.3 Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of \nChange-in-ControlProvisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or  \nany Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article 13 may not be       \nterminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change in Control to   \naffect adversely any Award theretofore granted under the Plan without the prior   \nwritten consent of the Participant with respect to said Participant\u2019s outstanding \nAwards; provided, however, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the     \nCommittee, may terminate, amend, or modify this Article 13 at any time and from   \ntime to time prior to the date of a Change in Control. Article 14. Amendment,     \nModification, and Termination 14.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. The  \nBoard may at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate   \nthe Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that an amendment to the Plan may\nbe conditioned on the approval of the stockholders of the Company if and to the   \nextent the Board determines that stockholder approval is necessary or appropriate.\n14.2 Awards Previously Granted. No termination, amendment, or modification of the \nPlan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under\nthe Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award. 14.3 \nNo Repricing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the repricing \nof Options or SARs is prohibited without prior approval of the Company\u2019s          \nstockholders. For this purpose, a \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the following (or any  \nother action that has the same effect as any of the following): (A) changing the  \nterms of an Option or SAR to lower its Option Price or grant price; (B) any other \naction that is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting       \nprinciples; and (C) repurchasing for cash or canceling an Option or SAR at a time \nwhen its Option Price or grant price is greater than the Fair Market Value of the \nunderlying Shares in exchange for another Award, unless the cancellation and      \nexchange occurs in connection with a change in capitalization or similar change   \nunder Section 4.7 above. Such cancellation and exchange would be considered a     \n\u201crepricing\u201d regardless of whether it is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally  \naccepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the   \npart of the Participant.                                                          \n                                \n  B-12    2025\u00a0Proxy\u00a0Statement  \n                                \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \nArticle 15. Withholding 15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and\nthe right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company,\nan amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes     \n(including the Participant\u2019s FICA or other applicable social tax obligation)      \nrequired by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a     \nresult of this Plan. 15.2 Share Withholding. The Company may cause any tax        \nwithholding obligation described in Section 15.1 to be satisfied by the Company   \nwithholding Shares having a fair market value on the date the tax is to be        \ndetermined equal to the required tax withholding imposed on the transaction (not  \nto exceed maximum statutory rates). In the alternative, the Company may permit    \nParticipants to elect to satisfy the tax withholding obligation, in whole or in   \npart, by either (a) having the Company withhold Shares having a fair market value \non the date the tax is to be determined equal to the required tax withholding     \nimposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates) or (b)         \ntendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate fair market value equal  \nto the required tax withholding imposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum \nstatutory rates). All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed\nby the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that  \nthe Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. Article 16.             \nIndemnification Provisions for the indemnification of officers and directors of   \nthe Company in connection with the administration of the Plan shall be as set     \nforth in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect from  \ntime to time. Article 17. Successors All obligations of the Company under the Plan\nwith respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the \nCompany, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or     \nindirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially   \nall of the business and/or assets of the Company. Article 18. Legal Construction  \n18.1 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any      \nmasculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall      \ninclude the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 18.2 Severability.\nIn the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any   \nreason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the  \nPlan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid   \nprovision had not been included. 18.3 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards \nand the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or     \nnational securities exchanges as may be required. 18.4 Securities Law Compliance. \nWith respect to Insiders, transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with\nall applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3or its successors under the Exchange Act.  \nTo the extent any provision of the plan or action by the Committee fails to so    \ncomply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and      \ndeemed advisable by the Committee. 18.5 No Conflict. Unless otherwise provided for\nby an Award Agreement, in the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan \nand the terms of an Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. 18.6    \nGoverning Law. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all      \nagreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the   \nlaws of the State of Delaware. 18.7 Compliance With Code Section 409A. The Plan is\nintended to comply with Code Section 409A, to the extent applicable.              \nNotwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall be      \ninterpreted, operated and administered consistent with this intent. In that       \nregard, and notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company\nreserves the right to amend the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, by      \naction of the Committee, without the consent of any affected Participant, to the  \nextent deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of maintaining compliance with\nCode Section 409A. Article 19. Non-EmployeeDirectors 19.1 Restricted Stock Awards.\nSubject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, including the annual award limit \nfor Non-Employee Directors set forth in Section 4.6, the Board, at any time and   \nfrom time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Non-EmployeeDirectors  \nin such amounts as the Board shall determine. Notwithstanding the definition of   \n\u201cParticipant\u201d provided in Article 2 above, upon receipt of a grant of Shares of   \nRestricted Stock, a Non-EmployeeDirector shall be considered a Participant in the \nPlan. Each grant of Shares of Restricted Stock to a Non-EmployeeDirector shall be \nevidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period or Periods of       \nRestriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted, and such other     \nprovisions as the Board shall determine.                                          \n                           \n  Bank\u00a0of\u00a0America    B-13  \n                           \n                                                                                  \n  Table of Contents                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \n19.2 Administration. The Board shall be responsible for administering any grants  \nof Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors and shall have all of the powers    \nnecessary to enable it to properly carry out its duties hereunder. Not in         \nlimitation of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power to construe and       \ninterpret the Plan and to determine all questions that shall arise thereunder with\nrespect to grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors. The Board shall  \nhave such other and further specified duties, powers, authority and discretion as \nare elsewhere in the Plan either expressly or by necessary implication conferred  \nupon it. The Board may appoint such agents as it may deem necessary for the       \neffective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers  \nand duties as the Board may deem expedient or appropriate that are not            \ninconsistent with the intent of the Plan and this Article 19. The decision of the \nBoard upon all matters within the scope of authority shall be final and conclusive\non all persons, except to the extent otherwise provided by law. 19.3 Vesting.     \nNotwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, Shares of Restricted   \nStock granted to Non-EmployeeDirectors shall not become vested until the first    \nanniversary of the applicable date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of the next \nannual meeting of the stockholders of the Company) (the \u201c Non-EmployeeDirector    \nVesting Date\u201d), provided that if the Non-EmployeeDirector Vesting Date occurs less\nthan 50 weeks after the applicable date of grant, it shall count against the 5%   \nexception pool to the minimum vesting requirements set forth in Section 3.4. If   \nthe Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector before the Non-\nEmployee Director Vesting Date due to the Non-EmployeeDirector\u2019s death, or if     \nthere is a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date, then the Shares shall     \nbecome fully vested as of the date of such death or Change in Control, as         \napplicable. If the Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector \nat any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of the Vesting Date\nor a Change in Control, then the Shares shall become vested pro rata (based on the\nnumber of days between the grant date of the Shares of Restricted Stock, or in the\ncase of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a newly appointed Non-              \nEmployeeDirector, the date of commencement of services, and the date of cessation \nof services divided by (a) 365 days for grants made at an annual stockholders     \nmeeting or (b) the number of days from the date of commencement of services until \nthe next annual stockholders meeting for grants made to a newly appointed Non-    \nEmployeeDirector), and to the extent the Shares are not thereby vested they shall \nbe forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services.
