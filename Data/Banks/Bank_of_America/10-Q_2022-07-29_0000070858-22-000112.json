In addition,\nmultiple jurisdictions have implemented\nvarious economic sanctions, including on\nselect Russian government leaders and\nfinancial institutions. The government\nof Russia has also imposed its own\neconomic sanctions on certain non-\nRussian institutions.\n\nAt June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, our\ndirect net country exposure to Russia\nwas $550 million and $759 million, which\nprimarily consisted of outstanding loans\nand leases totaling $468 million and\n$679 million. All of our loans to\nRussian counterparties have been\ndowngraded and reported as reservable\ncriticized exposure, with their expected\ncredit losses incorporated into our\nestimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses. At June 30, 2022 and March 31,\n2022, our net country exposure to\nUkraine was not significant. For more\ninformation on our Russian exposure, see\nCredit Risk Management on page 29.\n\nWhile the Corporation\u2019s direct exposure\nto Russia is limited, the potential\nduration and impact of the\nRussia/Ukraine conflict and sanctions\nregime remain uncertain and could\nadversely affect the Corporation's\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial position.

By August\n31, 2022, the Federal Reserve will\nfinalize the new SCB, which will be\neffective from October 1, 2022 through\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nOn July 20, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nBoard of Directors (the Board) declared\na quarterly common stock dividend of\n$0.22 per share, an increase of five\npercent compared to the prior dividend,\npayable on September 30, 2022 to\nshareholders of record as of September\n2, 2022.\n\nFor more information on our capital\nresources, see Capital Management on\npage 22.\n                                                                                  \n  LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates                                                 \n                                                                                  \nImmediately after December 31, 2021, ICE\nBenchmark Administration (IBA) ceased\npublishing British Pound Sterling (GBP),\nEuro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen\n(JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-\nmonth U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings.\nHowever, certain GBP and JPY LIBOR\nsettings that became no longer\nrepresentative of the underlying market\nthat such rates sought to measure are\n                                                                                  \n  3Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nbeing published using a modified\ncalculation (i.e., on a \u201csynthetic\u201d\nbasis). The remaining USD LIBOR settings\n(i.e., overnight, one month, three\nmonth, six month and 12 month) will\ncease or become non-representative\nimmediately after June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Corporation continues to execute its\nenterprise-wide transition program with\nrespect to LIBOR and other impacted\nbenchmark rates. The Corporation has\nceased entering into new contracts that\nuse USD LIBOR as a reference rate,\nsubject to limited exceptions, including\nthose consistent with supervisory\nguidance issued by the Federal Reserve,\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC). The\nCorporation also continues to monitor a\nvariety of market scenarios as part of\nits transition efforts, including risks\nassociated with insufficient preparation\nby individual market participants or the\noverall market ecosystem, ability of\nmarket participants to transition away\nfrom impacted benchmarks, and access and\ndemand by clients and market\nparticipants to liquidity in certain\nproducts, including LIBOR products.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Corporation\nhas remediated a significant majority of\nits notional contractual exposure to\nLIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR\nsettings that will cease or\n\nbecome non-representative immediately\nafter June 30, 2023 (i.e., updated to\ninclude fallback provisions to\nalternative reference rates (ARRs), such\nas the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\nfor USD LIBOR, that are based on market-\ndriven protocols, regulatory guidance,\nand industry-recommended fallback\nprovisions and related mechanisms). The\nremaining non-remediated USD LIBOR\nexposure, a majority of which is made up\nof derivatives and commercial loans,\nrepresents a small minority of\noutstanding USD LIBOR notional\ncontractual exposure of the Corporation\nand will require active dialogue with\nclients to modify the contracts. For any\nresidual exposures after June 2023 that\ncontinue to have no fallback provisions,\nthe Corporation is assessing and\nplanning to leverage relevant\ncontractual and statutory solutions,\nincluding the Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at\nthe federal level in the U.S., and other\nrelevant legislation, to transition such\nexposure to ARRs.\n\nFor more information on the expected\nreplacement of LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates, see Executive Summary \u2013 Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 LIBOR and Other Benchmark\nRates in the MD&A and Item 1A.

The\nincrease in net interest income for the\nthree-month period was primarily driven\nby higher interest rates, lower premium\namortization expense and loan growth.\nThe increase in the six-month period was\nprimarily driven by lower premium\namortization expense, loan growth and\nhigher interest rates, partially offset\nby a decrease in the acceleration of net\ncapitalized loan fees due to Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP) loan\nforgiveness.

charges decreased $157 million\nand $116 million primarily driven by the\nimpact of non-sufficient funds and\noverdraft policy changes, partially\noffset by higher treasury service\ncharges.\n\n\u25cf Investment and brokerage services\nincreased $197 million for the six-month\nperiod primarily driven by the impacts\nof positive assets under management\n(AUM) flows and higher market\nvaluations, partially offset by declines\nin AUM pricing.\n\n\u25cf Investment banking fees decreased $994\nmillion and $1.8 billion primarily\ndriven by lower equity issuance and debt\nissuance fees.\n\n\u25cf Market making and similar activities\nincreased $891 million and $600 million\nprimarily driven by improved performance\nacross macro products in fixed income,\ncurrencies and commodities (FICC) and\nderivative products in Equities,\npartially offset by a weaker trading\nenvironment for credit products.\n\n\u25cf Other income decreased $666 million\nand $792 million primarily due to\ncertain valuation adjustments and higher\npartnership losses for ESG investments.\n                                                                                  \n  Provision for Credit Losses

million\nand $4.0 billion to $553 million for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2022\ncompared to the same periods in 2021.\nThe increase in both periods was\nprimarily driven by loan growth and a\ndampening macroeconomic outlook,\npartially offset by asset quality\nimprovement and reduced COVID-19\npandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties.\nThe increase in the six-month period was\nalso driven by a reserve build related\nto Russian exposure.

The majority of our\nrecurring tax preference benefits\nconsists of tax credits from ESG\ninvestments in affordable housing and\nwind energy investments where the\nrecurring tax credits are recognized\nover a term of up to 10 years, and in\nsolar energy where the tax credits are\nrecognized in the year the facilities\nare placed into service. Absent these\nESG tax credits and discrete tax\nbenefits, the effective tax rate would\nhave been approximately 26 percent\n\nand 25 percent for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the\n2021 Finance Act, which increased the\nU.K. corporation income tax rate to 25\npercent from 19 percent. This change is\neffective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably\naffects income tax expense on future\nU.K. earnings. As a result, during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2021, the\nCorporation recorded a positive income\ntax adjustment of approximately $2.0\nbillion with a corresponding write-up of\nU.K. net deferred tax assets, which\nreflected a reversal of previously\nrecorded write-downs of net deferred tax\nassets for prior changes in the U.K.\ncorporation income tax rate.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America6                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Supplemental Financial Data                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and return\non average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity\nas key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 8.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 47.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends.

For more information, see\nBusiness Segment Operations in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital\nannually during the strategic and\ncapital planning processes. We utilize a\nmethodology that considers the effect of\nregulatory capital requirements in\naddition to internal risk-based capital\nmodels. Our internal risk-based capital\nmodels use a risk-adjusted methodology\nincorporating each segment\u2019s credit,\nmarket, interest rate, business and\noperational risk components. For more\ninformation on the nature of these\nrisks, see Managing Risk on page 21. The\ncapital allocated to the business\nsegments is referred to as\n\nallocated capital. Allocated equity in\nthe reporting units is comprised of\nallocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting\nunit. For more information, including\nthe definition of a reporting unit, see\nComplex Accounting Estimates on page 46\nand Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor more information on our presentation\nof financial information on an FTE\nbasis, see Supplemental Financial Data\non page 7, and for reconciliations to\nconsolidated total revenue, net income\nand period-end total assets, see Note 17\n\u2013 Business Segment Information to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators that\nmanagement uses when evaluating segment\nresults.

These increases were driven by\nhigher revenue in FICC.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $362\nmillion to $3.1 billion primarily driven\nby the realignment of a liquidating\nbusiness activity from Global Markets to\nAll Other in the fourth quarter of 2021,\npartially offset by higher expenses\nrecognized for certain regulatory\nmatters.\n\nAverage total assets increased $69.2\nbillion to $866.7 billion driven by loan\ngrowth, derivative balances due to a\nstrong U.S. dollar and higher energy\nprices, and growth in commodities\nactivity.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 10 percent, unchanged from the\nprior-year period.

Sales and\ntrading revenue increased $233 million\nfrom higher revenues in both FICC and\nEquities. Excluding net DVA, sales and\ntrading revenue decreased $30 million,\nrelatively unchanged, driven by lower\nrevenue in FICC, largely offset by\nhigher revenue in Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $672\nmillion to $6.2 billion primarily due to\nthe same factors as described in the\nthree-month discussion, and an\nacceleration of expenses from incentive\ncompensation award changes in the prior-\nyear period.\n\nAverage total assets increased $102.1\nbillion to $862.8 billion driven by loan\ngrowth and commodities activity in FICC\nas well as increased client balances in\nEquities. Period-end total assets\nincreased $87.3 billion from December\n31, 2021 to $835.1 billion driven by\nderivative balances due to a strong U.S.\ndollar and higher energy prices, growth\nin commodities activity in FICC and\nincreased hedging of client activity\nwith stock positions relative to\nderivatives in Equities.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 12 percent, down from 16 percent,\nreflecting lower net income and an\nincrease in allocated capital.\n                                                                                  \n  Sales and Trading Revenue                                                       \n                                                                                  \nFor a description of sales and trading\nrevenue, see Business Segment Operations\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common set\nof measures for senior management and\nthe Board to clearly indicate the level\nof risk we are willing to take in\nalignment with our strategic and capital\nplans and ensure that the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile remains aligned with our\nrisk appetite. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative components and quantitative\nlimits that are reviewed and approved by\nthe Board at least annually.\n\nFor more information about the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including those\nrelated to the pandemic, see Item 1A.\nRisk Factors of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These risks\nare being managed within our Risk\nFramework and supporting risk management\nprograms.\n\nFor more information on our Risk\nFramework, our risk management\nactivities and the key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation, see the\nManaging Risk section in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning. For\nmore information, including related\nregulatory requirements, see Capital\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nCCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to\nsubmit a capital plan and planned\ncapital actions on an annual basis,\nconsistent with the rules governing the\nCCAR capital plan. We submitted our 2022\nCCAR capital plan and related\nsupervisory stress tests in April 2022\nand received our results on June 23,\n2022. Based on the results, we expect\nour SCB to be approximately 90 bps\nhigher than the current level of 2.5\npercent, and will therefore add\napproximately 90 bps to our current CET1\nminimum requirement of 9.5 percent. By\nAugust 31, 2022, the Federal Reserve\nwill finalize the new SCB, which will be\neffective from October 1, 2022 through\nSeptember 30, 2023. Our capital ratios\nmust remain above our minimum\nrequirements to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board renewed the\nCorporation\u2019s $25 billion common stock\nrepurchase program previously announced\nin April 2021. The Board\u2019s authorization\nreplaced the previous program. As with\nthe April authorization, the Board also\nauthorized common stock repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorizations, during the second\nquarter of 2022, we repurchased $975\nmillion of common stock, including\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder equity-based compensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general\n\nmarket conditions, and may be suspended\nat any time. Such repurchases may be\neffected through open market purchases\nor privately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The Corporation's\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated banking\nentity, BANA, are Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The approach that\nyields the lower ratio is used to assess\ncapital adequacy, including under the\nPCA framework. As of June 30, 2022, the\nCET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\nratios for the Corporation were lower\nunder the Standardized approach.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022, the Corporation's CET1 capital\nratio must be a minimum of 9.5 percent\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024 unless its\nsurcharge calculated as of December 31,\n2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021.

five-year transition period\nrelated to the adoption of the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and\nG-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At\nboth June 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5\npercent was applied in place of the\ncapital conservation buffer under the\nStandardized approach. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer for both\nperiods was zero. The CET1 capital\nregulatory minimum is the sum of the\nCET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5\npercent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5\npercent and our SCB or the capital\nconservation buffer, as applicable, of\n2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum\nincludes a leverage buffer of 2.0\npercent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, CET1 capital was\n$171.8 billion, relatively unchanged\nfrom December 31, 2021, with common\nstock repurchases, dividends and\nincreases in net unrealized losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities\nincluded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income largely offset by\nearnings. Tier 1 capital increased $4.4\nbillion primarily driven by non-\ncumulative perpetual preferred stock\nissuances, partially offset by the same\nfactors as CET1 capital. Total capital\nunder the Standardized approach\nincreased $4.7 billion primarily\n\ndriven by the same factors driving the\nincrease in Tier 1 capital and an\nincrease in the adjusted allowance for\ncredit losses included in Tier 2\ncapital. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at June 30, 2022,\nincreased $19.9 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 to $1,638\nbillion primarily due to loan growth,\npartially offset by client activity in\nGlobal Markets and a decrease in debt\nsecurities. Supplementary leverage\nexposure at June 30, 2022 increased\n$17.0 billion primarily due to higher\non- and off-balance sheet exposures in\nGlobal Markets .\n

BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At June\n30, 2022, BofAS had tentative net\ncapital of $20.0 billion.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $344 billion and\n$322 billion at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nparent company or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior regulatory\napproval. Liquidity is also held in\nnonbank entities, including the parent,\nNB Holdings and other regulated\nentities. The parent company and NB\nHoldings liquidity is typically in the\nform of cash deposited at BANA, which is\nexcluded from the liquidity at bank\nsubsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Liquidity held\nin other regulated entities, comprised\nprimarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nis primarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the parent company or to\nany other subsidiary may be subject to\nprior regulatory approval due to\nregulatory restrictions and minimum\n\nrequirements. Our other regulated\nentities also hold unencumbered\ninvestment-grade securities and equities\nthat we believe could be used to\ngenerate additional liquidity.

However, HQLA for purposes\nof calculating LCR is not reported at\nmarket value, but at a lower value that\nincorporates regulatory deductions and\nthe exclusion of excess liquidity held\nat certain subsidiaries. The LCR is\ncalculated as the amount of a financial\ninstitution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative\nto the estimated net cash outflows the\ninstitution could encounter over a\n30-day period of significant liquidity\nstress, expressed as a percentage. Our\naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net\nbasis, was $614 billion and $617 billion\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. For the same\nperiods, the average consolidated LCR\nwas 118 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR\nfluctuates due to normal business flows\nfrom customer activity. Liquidity Stress\nAnalysis We utilize liquidity stress\nanalysis to assist us in determining the\nappropriate amounts of liquidity to\nmaintain at the parent company and our\nsubsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range\nof scenarios. For more information on\nliquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 Liquidity Stress Analysis in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Net Stable Funding\nRatio The Net Stable Funding Ratio\n(NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for\nlarge banks to maintain a minimum level\nof stable funding over a one-year\nperiod. The requirement is intended to\nsupport the ability of banks to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses in both normal\nand adverse economic conditions and is\ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses\non short-term liquidity risks. The U.S.\nNSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. At June 30,\n2022, the Corporation and its insured\ndepository institutions were in\ncompliance with this requirement.\nDiversified Funding Sources We fund our\nassets primarily with a mix of deposits,\nand secured and unsecured liabilities\nthrough a centralized, globally\ncoordinated funding approach diversified\nacross products, programs, markets,\ncurrencies and investor groups.

For more\ninformation on our TLAC eligible and\ncallable outstanding notes, see\nLiquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified Funding\nSources in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $4.4\nbillion to $275.7 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, primarily\ndue to debt valuation adjustments,\nmaturities and redemptions, partially\noffset by debt issuances. We may, from\ntime to time, purchase outstanding debt\ninstruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions,\nliquidity and other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also make markets\nin our debt instruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2022, we issued $5.9 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding,\n\nincluding issuances and maturities and\nredemptions, see Note 11 \u2013 Long-term\nDebt to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage\nthe duration, interest rate and currency\nrisks of our borrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Excluding losses associated\nwith non-core mortgage sales, our net\ncharge-off ratio remained near historic\nlows and nonperforming loans and\ncommercial reservable criticized\nutilized exposure decreased, which was\npartially offset by an increase in\nreservable criticized exposure\nassociated with our direct exposure to\nRussia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine\nconflict. While the uncertainty around\nthe pandemic has largely dissipated,\nuncertainty remains regarding broader\neconomic impacts as a result of the\ncurrent geopolitical situation, supply\n\nchain disruptions and inflationary\npressures and could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality metrics in\nfuture periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus and/or internal\nhistorical experience, and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions, as\nwell as portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2022, the U.S. unemployment rate\ncontinued to decline and home prices\nincreased; however, inflationary\npressures continued to persist. During\nthe three months ended June 30, 2022,\nnet charge-offs remained relatively\nunchanged compared to the same period in\n2021. During the six months ended June\n30, 2022, net charge-offs decreased $341\nmillion to $865 million compared to the\nsame period in 2021, primarily driven by\nlower credit card losses, as loss rates\nremained near historic lows. During the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022,\nnonperforming loans decreased primarily\ndue to decreases from consumer real\nestate loan sales, partially offset by\nincreases from loans with expired\ndeferrals that were modified as troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs) during the\nfirst quarter of 2022.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $421 million\nduring the six months ended June 30,\n2022 to $6.6 billion.

have not yet demonstrated a\nsustained period of payment performance\nfollowing a TDR.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\ndecreased $39 million during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 primarily due\nto decreases from consumer real estate\nloan sales, partially offset by\nincreases from loans with expired\ndeferrals that were modified as TDRs\nduring the first quarter of 2022. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat June 30, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 62\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more decreased $83 million.\n\nNet charge-offs of $86 million and $76\nmillion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 increased $92\nmillion and $86 million compared to the\nsame periods in 2021 primarily due to\nloan sales that occurred in the second\nquarter of 2022.\n\nOf the $215.8 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat June 30, 2022, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period was $3.4\nbillion, or six percent, at June 30,\n2022. Residential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization period\ngenerally experienced a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At June 30, 2022, $49 million, or\none percent, of outstanding interest-\nonly\n\nresidential mortgages that had entered\nthe amortization period were accruing\npast due 30 days or more compared to\n$783 million, or less than one percent,\nfor the entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at June 30,\n2022, $237 million, or seven percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered the\namortization period were nonperforming,\nof which $99 million were contractually\ncurrent. Loans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-collateralized loans to\nour wealth management clients and have\nan interest-only period of three to ten\nyears. Approximately 94 percent of these\nloans that have yet to enter the\namortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until\n2025 or later.\n\nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nand 15 percent of outstandings at June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In the\nNew York area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island MSA made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n                                                    N\u2026                            \n                                                    C\u2026                            \n                                                    T\u2026                            \n  \u2026                               N\u2026                M\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    R\u2026       O\u2026                J\u2026       D\u2026       E\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    M\u2026       J\u2026       D\u2026       30       31       J\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    S\u2026       30       31       2\u2026       2\u2026       30                \u2026           \n  \u2026    C\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026          $  8\u2026    $  7\u2026    $  6\u2026    $  6\u2026    $  43    $  -5    $  \u2026    $  -7  \n  \u2026             2\u2026       2\u2026       3\u2026       3\u2026        5        \u2014       5        2  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             1\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026        \u2014       -2       \u2026       -4  \n  \u2026             9\u2026       9\u2026       1\u2026       86        1        \u2014       1        \u2014  \n  \u2026             8\u2026       8\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026        3        \u2014       3        \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             7\u2026       7\u2026       8\u2026       8\u2026       34        1       \u2026       -1  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  86    $  -6    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             1\u2026       1\u2026                                                       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026                                                       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt June 30, 2022, the home equity\nportfolio made up six percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years, and after the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans\ngenerally convert to 15- or 20-year\namortizing loans.

Of\nthe nonperforming home equity loans at\nJune 30, 2022, $260 million, or 46\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $217 million, or\n39 percent, of nonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more past due and\nhad been written down to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, less costs\nto sell. Accruing loans that were 30\ndays or more past due decreased $73\nmillion during the six months ended June\n30, 2022.\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2022, net recoveries remained unchanged\ncompared to the same period in 2021.\nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2022, net recoveries decreased $5\nmillion to $54 million compared to the\nsame period in 2021.\n\nOf the $27.1 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at June\n30, 2022, as shown in Table 21, 14\npercent require interest-only payments.\nThe outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhave reached the end of their draw\nperiod and have entered the amortization\nperiod was $5.9 billion at June 30,\n2022. The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the\n\nHELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30,\n2022, $50 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nJune 30, 2022, $409 million, or seven\npercent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nJune 30, 2022, 19 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio. In the New York area, the New\nYork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA\nmade up 13 percent of the outstanding\nhome equity portfolio at both June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve a\nreduction in the customer\u2019s interest\nrate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other\nconsumer loans are made through programs\nutilizing direct customer contact, but\nmay also utilize external programs. At\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our\ncredit card and other consumer TDR\nportfolio was $620 million and $672\nmillion, of which $551 million and $599\nmillion were current or less than 30\ndays past due under the modified terms.\n                                                                                  \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                    \n                                                                                  \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For\n\nmore information on our industry\nconcentrations, see Table 34 and\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations on\npage 38.\n\nFor more information on our accounting\npolicies regarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status, net charge-offs\nand TDRs for the commercial portfolio,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Commercial Credit Portfolio                                                     \n                                                                                  \nDuring the six months ended June 30,\n2022, commercial credit quality improved\nas charge-offs, nonperforming commercial\nloans and reservable criticized utilized\nexposure declined during this period.\nDue to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine\nconflict, all direct exposure to Russian\ncounterparties was downgraded and\nreported as reservable criticized\nexposure, and expected credit losses\nhave been incorporated into our estimate\nof the allowance for credit losses.\nOutstanding commercial loans and leases\nincreased $38.8 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 due to growth\nin commercial and industrial, primarily\nin Global Banking . This increase was\npartially offset by lower U.S. small\nbusiness commercial loans due to\nrepayments of PPP loans by the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) under the\nterms of the program. For more\ninformation on PPP loans, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America34                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate\nborrowers continued to stabilize as\npandemic-impacted sectors continued to\nrecover. However, many real estate\nmarkets, while improving, are still\nexperiencing some disruptions in demand,\nsupply chain challenges and tenant\ndifficulties. Demand for office space\ncontinues to be uncertain as companies\nevaluate space needs with employment\nmodels that utilize a mix of remote and\nconventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses remained relatively\nunchanged at $5.4 billion at June 30,\n2022, as asset quality improvement and\nreduced pandemic uncertainties were\noffset by a dampening macroeconomic\noutlook, loan growth and a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 41.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $56.7 billion during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2022 to\n$710.2 billion primarily driven by\nhigher loans and leases and derivative\nassets.

At June 30, 2022, 90\npercent of commercial nonperforming\nloans, leases and foreclosed properties\nwere secured and 62 percent were\ncontractually current. Commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at 90\npercent of their unpaid principal\nbalance, as the carrying value of these\nloans has been reduced to the estimated\ncollateral value less costs to sell.\n                                                                                  \n  37Bank of America                                                               \n

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in\nour credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $3.7 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net gains of $131 million and $122\nmillion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to net losses of\n$32 million and $68 million for the same periods in 2021.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing\n\nactivities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of\nbusiness through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than\nthrough country risk governance.

The increase was\nprimarily driven by increased net\ncounterparty exposure with central\nclearing counterparties and increased\nloan and loan equivalent exposure across\na mix of clients, partially\n\noffset by a reduction in deposits with\nthe central bank. Our second largest\nnon-U.S. country exposure was Germany\nwith net exposure of $32.1 billion at\nJune 30, 2022, a $1.7 billion decrease\nfrom December 31, 2021. The exposure\nreduction was primarily driven by lower\ndeposit activity with the central bank.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America40                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses\ndecreased $409 million from December 31,\n2021 to $13.4 billion at June 30, 2022,\nwhich included a $438 million reserve\ndecrease related to the consumer\nportfolio and a $29 million reserve\nincrease related to the commercial\nportfolio. The decrease in the allowance\nwas primarily driven by asset quality\nimprovement and reduced\n\npandemic uncertainties, partially offset\nby reserve builds related to loan\ngrowth, a dampening

offset\nby higher consumer real estate losses\ndue to loan sales. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $2.1 billion to\nan expense of $523 million, and $4.0\nbillion to an expense of $553 million\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 compared to the same periods in\n2021. The provision for credit losses\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan\ngrowth and a dampening macroeconomic\noutlook, partially offset by asset\nquality improvement and reduced pandemic\nuncertainties. The increase in the six-\nmonth period was also driven by a\nreserve build related to Russian\nexposure. For the same periods in the\nprior year, the provision for credit\nlosses benefited from reserve releases\ndue to an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. The provision for credit losses\nfor the consumer portfolio, including\nunfunded lending commitments,\n\nincreased $1.1 billion to an expense of\n$410 million and $1.9 billion to an\nexpense of $422 million for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2022\ncompared to the same periods in 2021.\nThe provision for credit losses for the\ncommercial portfolio, including unfunded\nlending commitments, increased $1.0\nbillion to an expense of $113 million\nand $2.1 billion to an expense of $131\nmillion for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 compared to the same\nperiods in 2021.\n\nTable 39 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\nthe three and six months ended June 30,\n2022 and 2021.

see Market Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 40 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and\n\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio\nand the fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 40 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges.

Periodically, we evaluate the\nscenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar\ninterest rates are floored at zero.\nDepending on the level of interest\nrates, Down-rate scenarios may not\nreceive the full impact of the rate\nshock, particularly in low rate\nenvironments. During the six months\nended June 30, 2022, the overall\ndecrease in asset sensitivity of our\nbalance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate\nscenarios was primarily due to an\nincrease in long-end and short-end\nrates. We continue to be asset sensitive\nto a parallel upward move in interest\nrates with the majority of that impact\ncoming from the short end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher interest\nrates negatively impact the fair value\nof our debt securities classified as\navailable for sale and adversely affect\naccumulated other comprehensive income\nand thus capital levels under the Basel\n3 capital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As\npart of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and\ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate\nsensitivity. The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and\nin alternate interest rate scenarios is a key\n\nassumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the\nbaseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any\ncustomer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing\ndeposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our\nbenefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative\nContracts We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our\nALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from\nthose risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged\nswaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps,\noptions, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-\ncurrency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options. The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be\nsplit into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk\nmanagement derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage\nour exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management\nfor the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in\nTable 43. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the\nCorporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant. Risk management\nderivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to\nvarious foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate\nsubstantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the\nCorporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments.\nThese foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures\nsuch as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on\nthe accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and\nservice mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate\nrisks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or\nheld for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by\nselling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest\nrates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related\nresidential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs\nand the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in\nthe MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  45Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThere were no significant gains or\nlosses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSR, IRLCs and LHFS, net of\ngains and losses on the hedge portfolio,\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 and 2021. For more information\non MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Climate Risk\nManagement Climate-related risks are\ndivided into two major categories: (1)\nrisks related to the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, which may entail\nextensive policy, legal, technology and\nmarket changes, and (2) risks related to\nthe physical impacts of climate change,\ndriven by extreme weather events, such\nas hurricanes and floods, as well as\nchronic longer-term shifts, such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels. These changes and events can\nhave broad impacts on operations, supply\nchains, distribution networks, customers\nand markets and are otherwise referred\nto, respectively, as transition risk and\nphysical risk. These risks can impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. The impacts of transition risk\ncan lead to and amplify credit risk or\nmarket risk by reducing our customers\u2019\noperating income or the value of their\nassets as well as expose us to\nreputational and/or litigation risk due\nto increased regulatory scrutiny or\nnegative public sentiment. Physical risk\ncan lead to increased credit risk by\ndiminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or impacting the value of\ncollateral. In addition, it could pose\nincreased operational risk to our\nfacilities and people. In 2021, we\npublicly announced our goal to achieve\nnet zero greenhouse gas emissions in our\nfinancing activities, operations and\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal). We also committed to set emission\nreduction targets for 2030. In\nconnection with this commitment, on\nApril 13, 2022, we published our first\ntargets to reduce emissions by 2030\nassociated with our financing activities\nin the auto manufacturing, energy and\npower generation sectors (2030 Targets).\nIn line with our participation in the\nNet Zero Banking Alliance, we currently\nexpect to set financing activity\nemission reduction targets for other key\nsectors in 2024. These reduction targets\nare intended to align with the\nInternational Energy Agency Net Zero\nEmissions 2050 global pathway to limit\nwarming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We plan\nto disclose our 2019 financed emissions\nbaseline for our auto manufacturing,\nenergy and power generation sectors\nalong with 2020 data in our 2022 Task\nForce for Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) Report that we expect\nto publish in the Fall of 2022. We also\nplan to disclose the financed emissions\nfor our business loan portfolio in 2023.\nAchieving our Net Zero Goal and 2030\nTargets will require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, public policies,\nincluding those that improve the cost of\ncapital for net zero transition and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well\nas ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith clients, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders. Given the extended period\nof these and other climate-related goals\nwe have established, our initiatives\nhave not resulted in a significant\neffect on our results of operations or\nfinancial condition in the relevant\nperiods presented herein, and are not\nexpected to have a significant effect on\nour results of operations or financial\ncondition in the near-term.

\nNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and\n\ndisclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates\nand assumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the Corporation\u2019s\nbusiness is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a full year.\nIn the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current-\nperiod presentation. Accounting\nStandards Issued and Not Yet Adopted\nHedge Accounting The FASB issued a new\naccounting standard effective on January\n1, 2023, with early adoption permitted,\nthat makes targeted improvements to the\napplication of the fair value hedge\naccounting guidance for closed\nportfolios of financial assets. Upon\nadoption, the application of these hedge\nstrategies would be applied\nprospectively.

The Corporation also uses these\ntypes of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and\nliabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation\nhedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have\nfunctional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts\nand cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt\n(net investment hedges).

At both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 4.8billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure\nto the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.8billion at the\ntransfer dates. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of the\ntransferred securities was $ 4.9billion and $ 5.0billion. Sales and Trading\nRevenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and\nliabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to include these derivative\ninstruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed\non a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global Markets business segment.\nFor more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.

the\nCorporation for most credit derivatives.\nHowever, the Corporation does not\nmonitor its exposure to credit\nderivatives based solely on the notional\namount because this measure does not\ntake into consideration the probability\nof occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of\nthe Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is\nused to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit\nrisk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-\nrelated notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by\ncollateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as\ntrading securities. The carrying value\nof these instruments equals the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.\nThe Corporation is not obligated to make\nany payments to the entities under the\nterms of the securities owned. Credit-\nrelated Contingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain credit\nrisk-related contingent features,\nprimarily in the form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and credit support\ndocumentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n107.3billion and $ 91.4billion and\nposted cash and securities collateral of\n$ 81.4billion and $ 79.3billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends\non the contract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. At June 30, 2022, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the\nterms of the contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain subsidiaries\ncould be required to post to\ncounterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.0billion,\nincluding $ 1.6billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National Association (BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able\nto unilaterally terminate certain\ncontracts, or the Corporation or certain\n\nsubsidiaries may be required to take\nother action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee. At\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nliability recorded for these derivative\ncontracts was not significant.\nThe table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been\ncontractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at\nJune 30, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt\nratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and\nby an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative\nliabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon\ndowngrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt\nratings.\n                                                                                  \n  Additional Collateral Required to be                                            \n  Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject                                       \n  to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade                                        \n  at June 30, 2022                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                           One            Second  \n  (Dollars in millions)                            Incremental       Incremental  \n                                                         Notch             Notch  \n  Additional collateral required to be                                            \n  posted upon downgrade                                                           \n  Bank of America Corporation                   $          566    $        1,030  \n  Bank of America, N.A. and                                184               754  \n  subsidiaries(1)                                                                 \n  Derivative liabilities subject to                                               \n  unilateral termination upon downgrade                                           \n  Derivative liabilities                        $           14    $          778  \n  Collateral posted                                          5               528  \n                                                                                  \n(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.\nValuation Adjustments on Derivatives\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains\n(losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities),\nwhich are recorded in market making and similar activities, for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases Commercial nonperforming loans\ndecreased to $ 1.3billion at June 30, 2022 from $ 1.6billion at December 31, 2021.\nConsumer nonperforming loans decreased to $ 2.9billion at June 30, 2022 from $\n3.0billion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases from consumer real\nestate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals\nthat were modified in TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. The following table\npresents the Corporation\u2019s nonperforming loans and leases, including nonperforming\nTDRs, and loans accruing past due 90days or more at June 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.

At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 residential mortgage includes $\n395million and $ 444million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 97million and $ 190million\nof loans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate,\nCredit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of\nfinancing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at June 30,\n2022, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional\ncredit decision after origination or through a TDR.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America66                                                               \n

Concessions may\ninclude reductions in interest rates,\ncapitalization of past due amounts,\nprincipal and/or interest forbearance,\npayment extensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or combinations\nthereof. Prior to permanently modifying\na loan, the Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with certain\nborrowers under both government and\nproprietary programs. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a\nthree- to four-month period during which\nthe borrower makes monthly payments\nunder the anticipated modified payment\nterms. Upon successful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation and the\nborrower enter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n242million that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by\nthe borrower were included in TDRs at\nJune 30, 2022, of which $ 64million were\nclassified as nonperforming and $\n42million were loans fully insured. At\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nremaining commitments to lend additional\nfunds to debtors whose terms have been\nmodified in a consumer real estate TDR\nwere not significant. Consumer real\nestate foreclosed properties totaled $\n115million and $ 101million at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. The carrying\nvalue of consumer real estate loans,\nincluding fully-insured loans, for which\nformal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021 was $ 1.0billion and $\n1.1billion. During the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 99million and $ 20million\nof consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally\nFHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash\ninvesting activities and, accordingly,\nare not reflected in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. The table below\npresents the June 30, 2022 and 2021\nunpaid principal balance, carrying\nvalue, and average pre- and post-\nmodification interest rates of consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified in\nTDRs during the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Credit card and other consumer loan\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the\ncustomer\u2019s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The\nCorporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by\nthe Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan\nmodifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nprovide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external\nprograms). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral\nvalue and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

accrued interest and fees.\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are\ndeemed to be in payment default during\nthe quarter in which a borrower misses\nthe second of twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 10percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 17percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing the\nborrower with an\nopportunity to work through financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid foreclosure\nor bankruptcy. Each modification is\nunique and reflects the individual\ncircumstances of the borrower.\nModifications that result in a TDR may\ninclude extensions of maturity at a\nconcessionary (below market) rate of\ninterest, payment forbearances or other\nactions designed to benefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk\nexposure. Reductions in interest rates\nare rare. Instead, the interest rates\nare typically increased, although the\nincreased rate may not represent a\nmarket rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal\nforgiveness in connection with\nforeclosure, short sale or other\nsettlement agreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the loan.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America72                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAt the time of restructuring, the loans\nare remeasured to reflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash flows resulting\nfrom the modified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded at the time\nof restructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already been\nrecorded in a previous period such that\nno charge-off is required at the time of\nmodification. During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, the carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s commercial\nloans that were modified as TDRs was $\n796million and $ 1.3billion compared to\n$ 320million and $ 865million for the\nsame periods in 2021. At June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, the Corporation\nhad commitments to lend $ 369million and\n$ 283million to commercial borrowers\nwhose loans were classified as TDRs. The\nbalance of commercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 136million and $\n262million at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $ 6.7billion and\n$ 15.6billion at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Cash and non-cash\nproceeds from sales and paydowns of\nloans originally classified as LHFS were\n$ 21.4billion and $ 18.2billion for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nCash used for originations and purchases\nof LHFS totaled $ 11.4billion and $\n17.0billion for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021. Also included\nwere non-cash net transfers into LHFS of\n$ 1.6billion for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, primarily driven by the\ntransfer of a $ 1.6billion affinity card\nloan portfolio to held for sale in\nanticipation of its sale later in 2022,\nand $ 709million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021. Accrued Interest\nReceivable Accrued interest receivable\nfor loans and leases and loans held-for-\nsale at June 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021 was $ 2.5billion and $ 2.2billion\nand is reported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022, the Corporation\nreversed $ 80million and $ 160million of\ninterest and fee income against the\nincome statement line item in which it\nwas originally recorded upon charge-off\nof the principal balance of the loan\ncompared to $ 124million and $\n282million for the same periods in 2021\n.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021, interest and fee income\nreversed at the time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in\n\nthe quantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The June 30, 2022 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic outlooks that included\na baseline scenario, which is derived\nfrom consensus estimates, a downside\nscenario that assumed a significantly\nlonger period until full economic\nrecovery, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing, and a scenario to\naccount for persistent inflation and\nhigher interest rates at levels above\nwhat is already factored into the\nCorporation\u2019s baseline and other\ndownside scenarios. The Corporation\u2019s\nupside scenario was removed as of March\n31, 2022 due to geopolitical events\nreducing the likelihood of an upside\noutlook at such time and continued to be\nexcluded as of June 30, 2022 given the\ndampening macroeconomic outlook. The\nweighted economic outlook assumes that\nthe U.S. average unemployment rate will\nbe fivepercent by the fourth quarter of\n2022 and will stay just above\nfivepercent in the fourth quarter of\n2023. Additionally, in this economic\noutlook, U.S. gross domestic product is\nforecasted to grow at 0.6percent and\n0.8percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2022 and 2023. While asset\nquality continues to improve and\neconomic uncertainty around the pandemic\nhas largely dissipated, uncertainty\nremains regarding broader economic\nimpacts as a result of the current\ngeopolitical situation, supply chain\ndisruptions and inflationary pressures\nand could lead to adverse impacts to\ncredit quality metrics in future\nperiods. As such, the Corporation has\nfactored the aforementioned\nuncertainties into its allowance for\ncredit losses. The allowance for credit\nlosses at June 30, 2022 was $\n13.4billion, a decrease of $ 409million\ncompared to December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses was primarily driven by asset\nquality improvement and reduced pandemic\nuncertainties, partially offset by\nreserve builds related to loan growth, a\ndampening macroeconomic outlook and\nRussian exposure. The change in the\nallowance for credit losses was\ncomprised of a net decrease of $\n414million in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a $ 5million increase\nin the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The decrease in the\nallowance for credit losses was\nattributed to $ 178million in the\nconsumer real estate portfolio, and $\n260million in the credit card and other\nconsumer portfolio, partially offset by\nan increase of $ 29million in the\ncommercial portfolio. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $ 2.1billion to\nan expense of $ 523million, and $\n4.0billion to an expense of $ 553million\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 compared to the same periods in\n2021. The provision for credit losses\nfor the three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan\ngrowth and a dampening macroeconomic\noutlook, partially offset by asset\nquality improvement and reduced pandemic\nuncertainties. The increase in the six-\nmonth period\n                                                                                  \n  73Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nwas also driven by a reserve build related to Russian exposure. For the same\nperiods in the prior year, the provision for credit losses benefited from reserve\nreleases due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Outstanding loans and leases\nexcluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $ 54.0billion\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2022 driven by commercial loans, which\nincreased $ 40.9billion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans, which\nincreased $ 13.0billion, primarily driven by residential mortgage, securities-\nbased lending and credit card.

The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the sale\nor securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of\nloans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity\nloans, totaled $ 105.8billion and $ 138.7billion at June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nServicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 74million and $\n144million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $\n104million and $ 217million for the same periods in 2021. Servicing advances on\nserviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment,\nwere $ 1.7billion and $ 2.0billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans and leases in the consolidated\ncredit card trust included $ 2.7billion and $ 4.3billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America76                                                               \n                                                                                  \nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s\ninterest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables\nand cash reserve accounts. Senior debt securities totaling $ 1.0billion were\nissued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. At June 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card\nsecuritization trust with a notional principal amount of $ 6.7billion and $\n6.5billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior\ndebt securities and have a stated interest rate of zeropercent. There were $\n161million of subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization\ntrust during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Resecuritization Trusts\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed\nin a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 4.6billion and $ 14.2billion\nof securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $\n5.9billion and $ 14.7billion for the same periods in 2021. Securities transferred\ninto resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization\nand, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, resecuritization proceeds included securities\nwith an initial fair value of $ 1.0billion and $ 1.7billion compared to $\n233million and $ 519million, of which substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets for both periods and categorized as Level 2\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers\nmunicipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal\nbonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates\nthat reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts,\nincluding those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $ 3.4billion and\n$ 4.1billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The weighted-average\nremaining life of bonds held in the trusts at June 30, 2022 was 7.2years. There\nwere no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

Customer VIEs include\ncredit-linked, equity-linked and\ncommodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging\nVIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which\nare typically created on behalf of\ncustomers who wish to obtain market or\ncredit exposure to a specific company,\nindex, commodity or financial\ninstrument. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n993million and $ 2.9billion at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, including\nthe notional amount of derivatives to\nwhich the Corporation is a counterparty,\nnet of losses previously recorded, and\nthe Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs.\nCollateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The\nCorporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of fixed-income\nsecurities, typically corporate debt or\nABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed\nby third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets\nto these CDOs, holds securities issued\nby the CDOs and may be a derivative\ncounterparty to the CDOs. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs\ntotaled $ 124million and $ 235million at\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nInvestment VIEs The Corporation\nsponsors, invests in or provides\nfinancing, which may be in connection\nwith the sale of assets, to a variety of\ninvestment VIEs that hold loans, real\nestate, debt securities or other\nfinancial instruments and are designed\nto provide the desired investment\nprofile to investors or the Corporation.\nAt June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $\n657million and $ 1.0billion. The\nCorporation also held investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 7.8billion and $ 7.1billion at June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure\nassociated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $\n1.8billion and $ 2.0billion at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 comprised\nprimarily of on-balance sheet assets\nless non-recourse liabilities. Leveraged\nLease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net\ninvestment in consolidated leveraged\nlease trusts totaled $ 1.4billion and $\n1.5billion at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021. The trusts hold long-lived\nequipment such as rail cars, power\ngeneration and distribution equipment,\nand commercial aircraft. The Corporation\nstructures the trusts and holds a\nsignificant residual interest. The net\ninvestment represents the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged\nlease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is\nnon-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds\ninvestments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that\nconstruct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, wind and solar projects. An\nunrelated third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. The Corporation\nearns a return primarily through the\nreceipt of\n\ntax credits allocated to the projects.\nThe maximum loss exposure included in\nthe Other VIEs table was $ 26.7billion\nand $ 25.7billion at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The Corporation\u2019s\nrisk of loss is generally mitigated by\npolicies requiring that the project\nqualify for the expected tax credits\nprior to making its investment. The\nCorporation\u2019s investments in affordable\nhousing partnerships, which are reported\nin other assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, totaled $ 13.4billion and\n$ 12.6billion, including unfunded\ncommitments to provide capital\ncontributions of $ 6.4billion and $\n5.8billion, at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The unfunded\ncommitments are expected to be paid over\nthe next five years. During the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2022, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefits from investments in\naffordable housing partnerships of $\n375million and $ 748million and reported\npretax losses in other income of $\n314million and $ 627million. For the\nsame periods in 2021, the Corporation\nrecognized tax credits and other tax\nbenefits of $ 334million and $\n727million and reported pretax losses in\nother income of $ 279million and $\n555million. These tax credits are\nrecognized as part of the Corporation\u2019s\nannual effective tax rate used to\ndetermine tax expense in a given\nquarter. The Corporation may be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant.

At June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, the fair value of\nthis collateral was $ 759.9billion and $\n854.8billion, of which $ 702.6billion\nand $ 782.7billion were sold or\nrepledged. The primary source of this\ncollateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell.\nFor more information on collateral, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within\ncash and cash equivalents on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet of $\n6.4billion and $ 5.9billion,\npredominantly related to cash segregated\nin compliance with securities\nregulations and cash held on deposit\nwith central banks to meet reserve\nrequirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nCredit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 11.2billion and $ 10.7billion at\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The\ncarrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncredit extension commitments at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\nvalue option, were both $ 1.5billion,\nwhich predominantly related to the\nreserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The carrying value of these\ncommitments is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Legally\nbinding commitments to extend credit\ngenerally have specified rates and\nmaturities. Certain of these commitments\nhave adverse change clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation against\ndeterioration in the borrower\u2019s ability\nto pay. The following table includes the\nnotional amount of commitments of $\n3.6billion and $ 4.8billion at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 that are\naccounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the\ncumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 220million and $\n97million at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, which is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities. For more\ninformation regarding the Corporation\u2019s\nloan commitments accounted for under the\nfair value option, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair\nValue Option.\n

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 27.2billion and $\n10.5billion at June 30, 2022, and $ 26.3billion and $ 8.7billion at December 31,\n2021. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 146million and $ 512million\nat June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 1.2billion and $ 181million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 275million and $ 518million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation\nhad commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $\n410million and $ 949million, which upon settlement will be included in trading\naccount assets. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ncommitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing\nagreements of $ 96.2billion and $ 92.0billion, and commitments to enter into\nforward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 63.3billion and $\n32.6billion. These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months. At June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or\npurchase up to $ 3.8billion and $ 4.0billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto\nloans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through\nNovember 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior notice. At June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments\nof $ 958million and $ 395million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book\nValue Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection\nto insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations,\nprimarily banks. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amount of\nthese guarantees totaled $ 4.4billion and $ 6.3billion. At June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these guarantees\ntotaled $ 654million and $ 928million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033\nand 2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as\na sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges\nthat cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant\nfraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot\nbe collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may\nbe held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time\nlimits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network\nrules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was $\n482.0billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of\nJune 30, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to\ncircumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future\ndelivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic\nimpacts of the pandemic. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on representations and warranties obligations and\ncorporate guarantees, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve\nfor representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees was\n$ 1.2billion at both June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and\nthe related provision is included in\nother income in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The representations\nand warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of probable\nincurred losses, is based on its\nexperience in previous negotiations, and\nis subject to judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations\nand warranties losses may occur in\nexcess of the amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does\nnot expect such amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's financial condition\nand liquidity. See Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible\nloss in excess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 39.9billion and $ 42.0billion at\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities issued by certain\nstatutory trust companies that are\n100percent owned finance subsidiaries of\nthe Corporation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of\n\npredicting the outcome of such matters,\nparticularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages or\nwhere the matters present novel legal\ntheories or involve a large number of\nparties, the Corporation generally\ncannot predict the eventual outcome of\nthe pending matters, timing of the\nultimate resolution of these matters, or\neventual loss, fines or penalties\nrelated to each pending matter. As a\nmatter develops, the Corporation, in\nconjunction with any outside counsel\nhandling the matter, evaluates whether\nsuch matter presents a loss contingency\nthat is probable and estimable, and, for\nthe matters below and the matters\ndisclosed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, whether a loss\nin excess of any accrued liability is\nreasonably possible in future periods.\nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to\nbe both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued\nliability and record a corresponding\namount of litigation-related expense.\nThe Corporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation-related expense of\n$ 498million and $ 604million was\nrecognized for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 compared to $\n55million and $ 89million for the same\nperiods in 2021. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nfor which a loss in future periods is\nreasonably possible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued\nliability) and for representations and\nwarranties exposures, the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 1.0billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of June\n30, 2022. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure regarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities, management\ndoes not believe that loss contingencies\narising from pending matters, including\nthe matters described below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, will have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the\nsignificant judgment, variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties involved\nin those matters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and\nthe very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Prepaid Debit Card\nInvestigations On July 14, 2022, BANA\nagreed to settle twoseparate proceedings\nwith the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) and Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nrelated to BANA\u2019s administration of\nprepaid debit cards to distribute\nunemployment benefits. The orders found\nthat BANA\u2019s fraud\n                                                                                  \n  83Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nprevention measures and resolution of\npotentially unauthorized transactions\nimproperly delayed or denied access by\ncertain cardholders to account funds.\nWithout admitting or denying the\nfindings, BANA consented to orders\nrequiring it to improve its processes,\nreview accounts and compensate\ncardholders, and pay penalties of $\n125million and $ 100million to the OCC\nand CFPB, respectively. The Corporation\ncontinues to defend civil litigation,\nincluding putative class actions,\nconcerning BANA\u2019s administration of\nthese prepaid debit card programs.\nRecord-keeping Investigations Certain of\nthe Corporation\u2019s U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries have been cooperating with\ninvestigations by the SEC and U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission\n(CFTC) regarding compliance by financial\ninstitutions with record-keeping\nobligations for broker-dealers,\ninvestment advisors, and swaps dealers\npertaining to business-related\nelectronic communications sent over\nunapproved electronic messaging\nchannels. These subsidiaries are engaged\nin settlement negotiations with the SEC\nand CFTC and anticipate that resolution\nwill include the payment of civil money\npenalties.

Value Measurements\nUnder applicable accounting standards,\nfair value is defined as the exchange\nprice that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the\nmeasurement date. The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy\nclassifications are made if the\nsignificant inputs used in the financial\nmodels measuring the fair values of the\nassets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable in the\ncurrent marketplace. During the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, there were\nno changes to valuation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are expected to\nhave, a material impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations. For\nmore information regarding the fair\nvalue hierarchy, how the Corporation\nmeasures fair value and valuation\ntechniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The Corporation accounts for\ncertain financial instruments under the\nfair value option.
