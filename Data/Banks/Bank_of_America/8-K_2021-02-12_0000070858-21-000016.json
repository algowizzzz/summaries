(\u201cBank of America\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\ntoday announced that its Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has\napproved 2020 total compensation for Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer Brian T. Moynihan of $24,500,000, compared\nwith $26,500,000 awarded for 2019.\n\nIn determining this compensation, the independent members of the\nBoard evaluated many aspects of the Company\u2019s performance in\n2020 given the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on financial\nperformance, its clients, communities and its own employees.\n\nShareholders . For shareholders, the Company earned nearly $18\nbillion in net income, strengthened its capital and liquidity to\nrecord levels, improved its book value per common share, and\ndistributed more than $13 billion to shareholders through\ndividends and share repurchases. The Company\u2019s responsible\ngrowth over the past decade and prudent approach to capital\nplanning also put it in a position to begin returning more\ncapital as allowed entering 2021, with $36 billion of excess\ncapital above minimum requirements.\n\nEmployees . During the early stages of the pandemic, the Company\ncommitted to no COVID-related layoffs in 2020, implemented\nbusiness continuity plans, restricted travel and in-person\nmeetings, established a work-from-home posture for approximately\n85% of the Company\u2019s employees, enhanced cleaning procedures,\nprovided health supplies and wellness checks, established site\nspecific physical distancing plans, enhanced employee benefits,\nand expanded capacity to serve clients virtually. Enhanced\nbenefits provided to employees and their families in 2020\nincluded nearly three million days of back-up care for children\nand adults. In 2020 the Company also had record employee\nsatisfaction and diversity and inclusion index scores,\nrecognizing the longstanding commitment to being a great place\nto work and the Company\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\nThe Company also raised the minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S.\nteammates to $20 in 2020, one year earlier than planned.\nAdditionally, the Company announced Delivering Together awards\nto 97% of teammates to recognize their outstanding efforts\nthroughout the pandemic to be paid in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nClients . Pandemic-related support for clients began with\nproviding service through resilient and scaled operating\nsystems, even as record volumes of client activity occurred\nacross many platforms. To aid distressed borrowers, the Company\nprocessed approximately two million loan payment deferral\nrequests through the Client Assistance Program (approximately\n77,000 remained in place at the end of 2020). Under the initial\nfunding of the Paycheck Protection Program created under the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, the Company\nextended approximately 343,000 loans to small businesses, ending\nthe year with $23 billion in balances. The Company also approved\n$276 billion in new or expanded commercial commitments and\nraised $772 billion in capital for clients across debt and\nequity markets in 2020. At the same time, the Company supported\nits institutional investor clients by providing liquidity and a\nstrong and resilient trading platform.\n\nCommunities . The Company also assisted the communities it\nserves across the U.S. and globally, much of which was\naccomplished through local outreach with community partners,\nincluding donations of 19 million masks, 13,000 cases of\nsanitizer and 1.4 million gloves for vulnerable populations. The\nCompany contributed $350 million in philanthropy to address\ncritical needs related to the pandemic, a $100 million increase\nover 2019. The Company ended 2020 as the largest private\ninvestor in Community Development Financial Institutions\n(\u201cCDFIs\u201d) in the U.S., with a $1.6 billion portfolio spanning\n255 partner CDFIs across all 50 states. To support racial equity\nand economic opportunity in its communities, the Company\ncommitted $1 billion over four years, $300 million of which has\nalready been allocated, as follows:\n\n\u25e6 $25 million in support of jobs initiatives\n\n\u25e6 $25 million to support underserved and minority communities\n\n\u25e6 $50 million in direct equity investments to Minority\nDepository Institutions\n\n\u25e6 $200 million of equity funding to minority entrepreneurs and\nbusinesses\n\nThe Company issued a $1 billion corporate social bond to support\nthe fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, with proceeds\nsupporting not-for-profit hospitals, skilled nursing facilities,\nand manufacturers of healthcare equipment and supplies. Further,\nthe Company issued a first-of-its-kind $2 billion Equality\nProgress Sustainability Bond to help advance racial equality,\neconomic opportunity and environmental sustainability.\n\nIn addition, the Board recognized Mr. Moynihan\u2019s leadership in\n2020 in the financial services industry and other CEO forums,\nincluding as Chairman of the International Business Council\n(World Economic Forum) and the Bank Policy Institute, and co-\nchairmanship of the Sustainable Markets Initiative. Mr. Moynihan\nwas recognized by fellow CEOs across industries as Chief\nExecutive Magazine\u2019s 2020 CEO of the Year.\n\nMr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation structure continues to be composed\nof base salary, time-based restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), and\nperformance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan\u2019s annual base salary remains $1.5\nmillion. The aggregate value of his 2020 equity incentive award\nis $23 million. Consistent with prior years, there is no cash\nbonus. The incentive is comprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that\nwill vest over the next 12 months, 20% of stock-settled RSUs\nthat will vest annually over the next four years (extended from\nthree-year pro-rata in prior years to further drive long-term\nshareholder alignment), and 50% of performance RSUs that will be\nearned only if Bank of America\u2019s future financial performance\nmeets specific standards.\n\nThe overall structure of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2020 performance RSUs is\nconsistent with the prior eight years, during which time the\nannual advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d shareholder vote regarding the\nCompany\u2019s executive compensation program has been approved with\nan average of 94.5% support. The performance RSUs awarded to Mr.\nMoynihan continue to use a \u201cre-earn\u201d approach, vesting only if\nthe Company meets performance standards over a three-year\nperiod. Under this \u201cre-earn\u201d approach, future adverse\nperformance of the Company below the standards of the\nperformance RSUs will decrease the amount ultimately paid; 100%\nis the maximum payout if standards are met. The three-year\naverage ROA standards for the newly awarded performance RSUs\nhave been recalibrated in light of the current economic climate,\nincluding the historically low interest rate structure, with a\ntarget of 0.80%. There is no change to the standards for three-\nyear average growth in adjusted tangible book value. The Board\ndid not change the standards for previously granted but not yet\nvested performance RSU awards.\n\nAdditionally, all of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2020 equity incentive awards\nare subject to Bank of America\u2019s stock ownership and retention\nrequirements. Specifically, 50% of the net after-tax shares he\nreceives from equity awards must be retained until one year\nafter his retirement. These equity awards also are subject to\nBank of America\u2019s clawback policies.\n                                                                \n                           SIGNATURES                           \n                                                                \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on\nits behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                                                \n  BANK OF AMERICA                                               \n  CORPORATION                                                   \n                             By:    /s/ Ross E.
