The remaining USD LIBOR settings\n(i.e., overnight, one month, three\nmonth, six month and 12 month) will\ncease or become non-representative\nimmediately after June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Corporation continues to execute its\nenterprise-wide transition program with\nrespect to LIBOR and other impacted\nbenchmark rates. The Corporation has\nceased entering into new contracts that\nuse USD LIBOR as a reference rate,\nsubject to limited exceptions, including\nthose consistent with supervisory\nguidance issued by the Federal Reserve,\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance\n\nCorporation (FDIC). The Corporation also\ncontinues to monitor a variety of market\nscenarios as part of its transition\nefforts, including risks associated with\ninsufficient preparation by individual\nmarket participants or the overall\nmarket ecosystem, ability of market\nparticipants to transition away from\nimpacted benchmarks, and access and\ndemand by clients and market\nparticipants to liquidity in certain\nproducts, including LIBOR products.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Corporation\nhas remediated a significant majority of\nits notional contractual exposure to\nLIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR\nsettings that will cease or become non-\nrepresentative immediately after June\n30, 2023 (i.e., updated to include\nfallback provisions to alternative\nreference rates (ARRs), such as the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate for USD\nLIBOR, that are based on market-driven\nprotocols, regulatory guidance, and\nindustry-recommended fallback provisions\nand related mechanisms). The remaining\nnon-remediated USD LIBOR exposure, a\nmajority of which is made up of\nderivatives and commercial loans,\nrepresents a small minority of\noutstanding USD LIBOR notional\ncontractual exposure of the Corporation\nand requires active dialogue with\nclients to modify such contracts. For\nany residual exposures after June 2023\nthat continue to have no fallback\nprovisions, the Corporation is assessing\nand planning to leverage relevant\ncontractual and statutory solutions,\nincluding the Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at\nthe federal level in the U.S. and\nsubject to the issuance of final\nimplementing rules by the Federal\nReserve, and other relevant legislation,\nto transition such exposure to ARRs.\n\nFor more information on the expected\nreplacement of LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates, see Executive Summary \u2013 Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 LIBOR and Other Benchmark\nRates in the MD&A and Item 1A.

The decrease in\nnet income was primarily due to an\nincrease in provision for credit losses,\nlower noninterest income and higher\nnoninterest expense, partially offset by\nhigher net interest income. In addition,\nthe nine-month period in the prior year\nincluded a positive income tax\nadjustment related to the revaluation of\nU.K. net deferred tax assets.\n\nTotal assets decreased $96.5 billion\nfrom December 31, 2021 to $3.1 trillion\nprimarily driven by lower cash and cash\nequivalents due to deposit outflows\nrelated to the rising interest rate\nenvironment and lower debt securities,\npartially offset by loan growth across\ncommercial and consumer products, as\nwell as higher trading account assets\nand derivative assets to support Global\nMarkets activity.\n\nTotal liabilities decreased $96.0\nbillion from December 31, 2021 to $2.8\ntrillion primarily driven by deposit\noutflows related to the rising interest\nrate environment and customer tax\npayments.\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity decreased $542\nmillion from December 31, 2021 primarily\ndue to market value decreases on\nderivatives and debt securities, as well\nas returns of capital to\n\nshareholders through common and\npreferred stock dividends and common\nstock repurchases, partially offset by\nnet income and the issuance of preferred\nstock.\n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income                                                             \n                                                                                  \nNet interest income increased $2.7\nbillion to $13.8 billion, and $6.3\nbillion to $37.8 billion for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2022\ncompared to the same periods in 2021.\nNet interest yield on a fully taxable-\nequivalent (FTE) basis increased 38\nbasis points (bps) to 2.06 percent, and\n21 bps to 1.87 percent for the same\nperiods. The increase in net interest\nincome for the three-month period was\nprimarily driven by benefits from higher\ninterest rates, including lower premium\namortization expense, and loan growth,\npartially offset by lower deposits and\nsecurities. The increase in the nine-\nmonth period was primarily driven by\nlower premium amortization expense, loan\ngrowth and higher interest rates,\npartially offset by a decrease in the\nacceleration of net capitalized loan\nfees due to Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) loan forgiveness.

The provision for credit losses\nfor the three months ended September 30,\n2022 was primarily driven by loan growth\nand a dampening macroeconomic outlook,\nand the nine-month period was driven by\nthe same factors as well as a reserve\nbuild related to Russian exposure,\npartially offset by asset quality\nimprovement and reduced COVID-19\npandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties.\nFor the same periods in the prior year,\nthe benefit in the provision for credit\nlosses was due to an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook.

Also included in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 was the\nimpact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change\nfurther discussed in this section. The\nmajority of our recurring tax preference\nbenefits consists of tax credits from\nESG investments in affordable housing,\nwhere the recurring tax credits are\nrecognized ratably over a term of up to\n10 years, and wind and solar energy\ninvestments, where the tax credits are\nrecognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax\nCredits (ITCs) or as energy is produced\nif electing Production Tax Credits\n(PTCs), as further discussed below.\nAbsent ESG tax credits and unusual\nitems, the effective tax rates would\nhave been approximately 25 percent.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022, which\ncontained a number of tax-related\nprovisions, including the extension and\nexpansion of renewable energy tax credit\nprograms. In particular, partnerships\nare no longer limited to an ITC, but can\nnow elect a PTC for solar energy\nproduction facilities placed in service\nafter December 31, 2021. As a result,\nthe Corporation changed its estimated\nimpact of solar-related tax credits and\nreversed the impact of certain solar\ninvestment tax credits recognized in the\nfirst half of\n\n2022, which increased income tax expense\nby $152 million in the third quarter of\n2022. If there is a change in the\nexpected tax credit election, an income\ntax adjustment will be recognized in the\nquarter in which the change occurs.\n\nOther notable tax law changes include\nthe establishment of a new 15 percent\nalternative minimum tax (AMT) on\nadjusted financial statement income for\nlarge corporations and a one percent\nexcise tax on net stock repurchases,\nboth of which are effective for tax\nyears beginning on or after January 1,\n2023. The tax law changes for the new\nAMT permit business credits, including\nthose from ESG investments in renewable\nenergy and affordable housing, to offset\npotential AMT liability. The Corporation\nhas assessed the potential impacts of\nthese two U.S. tax law changes and does\nnot expect the changes will have a\nsignificant effect on its future\neffective tax rate.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the\n2021 Finance Act, which increased the\nU.K. corporation income tax rate to 25\npercent from 19 percent. This change is\neffective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably\naffects income tax expense on future\nU.K. earnings. As a result, during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2021, the\nCorporation recorded a positive income\ntax adjustment of approximately $2.0\nbillion with a corresponding write-up of\nU.K. net deferred tax assets, which\nreflected a reversal of previously\nrecorded write-downs of net deferred tax\nassets for prior changes in the U.K.\ncorporation income tax rate.\n                                                                                  \n  7Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Supplemental Financial Data                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn this Form 10-Q, we present certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and return\non average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity\nas key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 9.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 48.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends. These key performance indicators\n(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated\nin the same way as similar KPIs used by\nother companies. For information on how\nthese metrics are defined, see Key\nMetrics on page 101.\n\nOur consolidated key performance\nindicators, which include various equity\nand credit metrics, are presented

We utilize a\nmethodology that considers the effect of\nregulatory capital requirements in\naddition to internal risk-based capital\nmodels. Our internal risk-based capital\nmodels use a risk-adjusted methodology\nincorporating each segment\u2019s credit,\nmarket, interest rate, business and\noperational risk components. For more\ninformation on the nature of these\nrisks, see Managing Risk on page 22. The\ncapital allocated to the business\nsegments is referred to as\n\nallocated capital. Allocated equity in\nthe reporting units is comprised of\nallocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting\nunit. For more information, including\nthe definition of a reporting unit, see\nNote 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor more information on our presentation\nof financial information on an FTE\nbasis, see Supplemental Financial Data\non page 8, and for reconciliations to\nconsolidated total revenue, net income\nand period-end total assets, see Note 17\n\u2013 Business Segment Information to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators that\nmanagement uses when evaluating segment\nresults.

Excluding net DVA, net income\nincreased $135 million to $1.1 billion.\nThese increases were primarily driven by\nlower noninterest expense.\n\nRevenue decreased $36 million to $4.5\nbillion primarily driven by lower\ninvestment banking fees, largely offset\nby higher sales and trading revenue.\nSales and trading revenue increased $478\nmillion, and excluding net DVA,\nincreased $472 million. These increases\nwere driven by higher revenue in FICC.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $229\nmillion to $3.0 billion primarily driven\nby the realignment of a liquidating\nbusiness activity from Global Markets to\nAll Other in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAverage total assets increased $43.0\nbillion to $847.9 billion driven by loan\ngrowth, higher derivative balances due\nto a strong U.S. dollar and higher\ninterest rates, as well as growth in\ncommodities activity.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 10 percent, unchanged from the\nprior-year period, reflecting higher net\nincome offset by an increase in\nallocated capital.

Excluding net DVA, net income\ndecreased $415 million to $3.5 billion.\nThese decreases were primarily driven by\nlower revenue, partially offset by lower\nnoninterest expense.\n\nRevenue decreased $1.2 billion to $14.3\nbillion primarily due to the same\nfactors as described in the three-month\ndiscussion. Sales and trading revenue\nincreased $711 million and excluding net\nDVA, sales and trading revenue increased\n$442 million. These increases were\ndriven by higher revenue in both FICC\nand Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $901\nmillion to $9.2 billion primarily due to\nthe same factor as described in the\nthree-month discussion and an\nacceleration of expenses from incentive\ncompensation award changes in the prior-\nyear period.\n\nAverage total assets increased $82.2\nbillion to $857.7 billion driven by loan\ngrowth and commodities activity in FICC\nas well as higher balances in Equities.\nPeriod-end total assets increased $101.0\nbillion from December 31, 2021 to $848.8\nbillion driven by higher derivative\nbalances due to a strong U.S. dollar and\nhigher interest rates, higher levels of\ninventory in FICC to facilitate client\nactivity, and increased hedging of\nclient activity with stock positions\nrelative to derivatives in Equities.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 12 percent, down from 14 percent,\nreflecting lower net income and an\nincrease in allocated capital.\n                                                                                  \n  Sales and Trading Revenue                                                       \n                                                                                  \nFor a description of sales and trading\nrevenue, see Business Segment Operations\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders.

The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common set\nof measures for senior management and\nthe Board to clearly indicate the level\nof risk we are willing to take in\nalignment with our strategic and capital\nplans and ensure that the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile remains aligned with our\nrisk appetite. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative components and quantitative\nlimits that are reviewed and approved by\nthe Board at least annually.\n\nFor more information about the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including those\nrelated to the pandemic, see Item 1A.\nRisk Factors of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

Based on the results\nof our 2022 CCAR stress test, our SCB\nincreased to 3.4 percent from 2.5\npercent, effective October 1, 2022\nthrough September 30, 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board renewed the\nCorporation\u2019s $25 billion common stock\nrepurchase program previously announced\nin April 2021. The Board\u2019s authorization\nreplaced the previous program. As with\nthe April 2021 authorization, the Board\nalso authorized common stock repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorizations, during the third quarter\nof 2022, we repurchased $450 million of\ncommon stock, predominantly offsetting\nshares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The Corporation's\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated banking\nentity, BANA, are Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The approach that\nyields the lower ratio is used to assess\ncapital adequacy, including under the\nPCA framework. As of September 30, 2022,\nthe CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital ratios for the Corporation were\nlower under the Standardized approach.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirement was 9.5\npercent under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. Based on the\nresults of our 2022 CCAR stress test,\nthe Corporation\u2019s SCB increased to 3.4\npercent, resulting in a minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirement of 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nfor the period from October 1, 2022\nthrough September 30, 2023. At September\n30, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s CET1 capital\nratio of 11.0 percent under the\nStandardized approach exceeded its new\nCET1 capital ratio requirement that was\neffective October 1, 2022. Our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the\nAdvanced approaches remains unchanged at\n9.5 percent.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024 unless its\nsurcharge calculated as of December 31,\n2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.

allows a five-year transition\nperiod related to the adoption of the\ncurrent expected credit losses (CECL)\naccounting standard.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and\nG-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. At both September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation's SCB\nof 2.5 percent was applied in place of\nthe capital conservation buffer under\nthe Standardized approach. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer for both\nperiods was zero. The CET1 capital\nregulatory minimum is the sum of the\nCET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5\npercent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5\npercent and our SCB or the capital\nconservation buffer, as applicable, of\n2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum\nincludes a leverage buffer of 2.0\npercent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, CET1 capital was\n$175.6 billion, an increase of $3.8\nbillion from December 31, 2021, due to\nearnings, partially offset by dividends,\nan increase in net unrealized losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities\nincluded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (OCI), and common\nstock repurchases. Tier 1 capital\nincreased $8.2 billion primarily driven\nby the same factors as CET1 capital as\nwell as non-cumulative perpetual\npreferred stock issuances. Total capital\nunder the Standardized approach\nincreased $7.7 billion primarily due to\nthe same factors driving the increase in\nTier 1\n\ncapital and an increase in the adjusted\nallowance for credit losses included in\nTier 2 capital. RWA under the\nStandardized approach, which yielded the\nlower CET1 capital ratio at September\n30, 2022, decreased $18.5 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022\nto $1,599 billion primarily due to lower\nclient activity in Global Markets and a\ndecrease in debt securities, partially\noffset by loan growth. Supplementary\nleverage exposure at September 30, 2022\ndecreased $48.2 billion primarily due to\nlower debt securities, driven by lower\ndeposits, partially offset by loan\ngrowth.\n

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Developments                                                         \n                                                                                  \nFor information on regulatory\ndevelopments, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Developments in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc.

The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also registered with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, BofAS had tentative\nnet capital of $19.1 billion. BofAS also\nhad regulatory net capital of $16.2\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of $4.1 billion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary\nof BofAS and provides clearing and\nsettlement services as well as prime\nbrokerage and arranged financing\nservices for institutional clients. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, MLPCC\u2019s regulatory\nnet capital of $7.8 billion exceeded the\nminimum requirement of $1.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $5.6 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $158\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators.

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nfluctuation from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand macroeconomic environment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand liquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access to\nfunding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.

NB Holdings Corporation The parent\ncompany, which is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries, has an\nintercompany arrangement with our\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).\nWe have transferred, and agreed to\ntransfer, additional parent company\nassets not required to satisfy\nanticipated near-term expenditures to NB\nHoldings. The parent company is expected\nto continue to have access to the same\nflow of dividends, interest and other\namounts of cash necessary to service its\ndebt, pay dividends and perform other\nobligations as it would have had it not\nentered into these arrangements and\ntransferred any assets.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $349 billion and\n$322 billion at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nparent company or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior regulatory\napproval. Liquidity is also held in\nnonbank entities, including the parent,\nNB Holdings and other regulated\nentities. The parent company and NB\nHoldings liquidity is typically in the\nform of cash deposited at BANA, which is\nexcluded from the liquidity at\n\nbank subsidiaries, and high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered securities.\nLiquidity held in other regulated\nentities, comprised primarily of broker-\ndealer subsidiaries, is primarily\navailable to meet the obligations of\nthat entity, and transfers to the parent\ncompany or to any other subsidiary may\nbe subject to prior regulatory approval\ndue to regulatory restrictions and\nminimum requirements. Our other\nregulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 14 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.\n                                                                                  \n                      Average Global              Three Months                    \n  Table 14            Liquidity                          Ended                    \n  (Dollars in         Sources                     September 30       December 31  \n  billions)           Composition                         2022              2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on deposit                         $                184    $          259  \n  U.S. Treasury                                            255               278  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-backed                                                                 \n  securities, and                                          487               606  \n  other                                                                           \n  investment-grade                                                                \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                                15                15  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                        $                941    $        1,158  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in\ncomposition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n(LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes\nof calculating LCR is not reported at\nmarket value, but at a lower value that\nincorporates regulatory deductions and\nthe exclusion of excess liquidity held\nat certain subsidiaries. The LCR is\ncalculated as the amount of a financial\ninstitution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative\nto the estimated net cash outflows the\ninstitution could encounter over a\n30-day period of significant liquidity\nstress, expressed as a percentage. Our\naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net\nbasis, was $618 billion and $617 billion\nfor the three months ended September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. For the same\nperiods, the average consolidated LCR\nwas 123 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR\nfluctuates due to normal business flows\nfrom customer activity. Liquidity Stress\nAnalysis We utilize liquidity stress\nanalysis to assist us in determining the\nappropriate amounts of liquidity to\nmaintain at the parent company and our\nsubsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range\nof scenarios. For more information on\nliquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 Liquidity Stress Analysis in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Net Stable Funding\nRatio The Net Stable Funding Ratio\n(NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for\nlarge banks to maintain a minimum level\nof stable funding over a one-year\nperiod. The requirement is intended to\nsupport the ability of banks to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses in both normal\nand adverse economic conditions and is\ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses\non short-term liquidity risks. The U.S.\nNSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions.

For more\ninformation on our TLAC eligible and\ncallable outstanding notes, see\nLiquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified Funding\nSources in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $11.0\nbillion to $269.1 billion during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2022,\nprimarily due to debt valuation\nadjustments, maturities and redemptions,\npartially offset by debt issuances. We\nmay, from time to time, purchase\noutstanding debt instruments in various\ntransactions, depending on market\nconditions, liquidity and other factors.\nOur other regulated entities may also\nmake markets in our debt instruments to\nprovide liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2022, we issued $8.6 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage\nthe duration, interest rate and currency\nrisks of our borrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Excluding losses associated\nwith non-core mortgage sales, our net\ncharge-off ratio remained near historic\nlows, and nonperforming loans and\ncommercial reservable criticized\nutilized exposure decreased, which was\npartially offset by an increase in\nreservable criticized exposure\n\nassociated with our direct exposure to\nRussia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine\nconflict. While uncertainty around the\npandemic has largely dissipated,\nuncertainty remains regarding broader\neconomic impacts as a result of\ninflationary pressures, rising rates and\nthe current geopolitical situation and\ncould lead to adverse impacts to credit\nquality metrics in future periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus and/or internal\nhistorical experience, and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions, as\nwell as portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2022, the U.S. unemployment rate\ncontinued to decline and home prices\nincreased compared to the same period a\nyear ago; however, inflationary\npressures continued to persist. Net\ncharge-offs increased $130 million to\n$459 million during the three months\nended September 30, 2022 and decreased\n$211 million to $1.3 billion during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2022\ncompared to the same periods in 2021.\nThe increase in the three-month period\nwas primarily due to overdrafts charged\noff in other consumer, and the decrease\nin the nine-month period was primarily\ndue to lower credit card losses, as loss\nrates remain near historic lows. During\nthe nine months ended September 30,\n2022, nonperforming loans declined\nprimarily due to decreases from consumer\nreal estate loan sales, partially offset\nby increases from loans with expired\ndeferrals that were modified as troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs) during the\nfirst quarter of 2022.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America30                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $153 million\nduring the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 to $6.9 billion.

have not yet demonstrated a\nsustained period of payment performance\nfollowing a TDR.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\ndecreased $97 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022\nprimarily due to decreases from consumer\nreal estate loan sales in the second\nquarter of 2022, partially offset by\nincreases from loans with expired\ndeferrals that were modified as TDRs\nduring the first quarter of 2022. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat September 30, 2022, $1.4 billion, or\n65 percent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more decreased $146 million.\n\nNet recoveries of $3 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2022\nremained relatively unchanged compared\nto the same period in 2021. Net charge-\noffs of $73 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2022 increased $90\nmillion compared to the same period in\n2021 primarily due to loan sales that\noccurred in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nOf the $217.1 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat September 30, 2022, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period was $3.4\nbillion, or six percent, at September\n30, 2022. Residential mortgage loans\nthat have entered the amortization\nperiod generally experienced a higher\nrate of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At September 30,\n\n2022, $37 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $720\nmillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at September 30,\n2022, $213 million, or six percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered the\namortization period were nonperforming,\nof which $84 million were contractually\ncurrent. Loans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-collateralized loans to\nour wealth management clients and have\nan interest-only period of three to ten\nyears. Approximately 95 percent of these\nloans that have yet to enter the\namortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until\n2025 or later.\n\nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nand 15 percent of outstandings at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. In the New York area, the New\nYork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA\nmade up 15 percent of outstandings at\nboth September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.\n                                                                                  \n                                                    N\u2026                            \n                                                    C\u2026                            \n                                                    T\u2026                            \n  \u2026                               N\u2026                M\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    R\u2026       O\u2026                S\u2026       D\u2026       E\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    M\u2026       S\u2026       D\u2026       30       31       S\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    S\u2026       30       31       2\u2026       2\u2026       30                \u2026           \n  \u2026    C\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026          $  8\u2026    $  7\u2026    $  6\u2026    $  6\u2026    $  -2    $  -3    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n  \u2026             2\u2026       2\u2026       3\u2026       3\u2026       -1        \u2014       4        2  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             1\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026        \u2014       -1       \u2026       -5  \n  \u2026             9\u2026       9\u2026       89       86        \u2014        \u2014       1        \u2014  \n  \u2026             8\u2026       8\u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       -1                2        \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             7\u2026       7\u2026       8\u2026       8\u2026        1       -3       \u2026       -4  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  -3    $  -7    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026             1\u2026       1\u2026                                                       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026                                                       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026                                                                               \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt September 30, 2022, the home equity\nportfolio made up six percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years, and after the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans\ngenerally\n\nconvert to 15- or 20-year amortizing\nloans.

Of\nthe nonperforming home equity loans at\nSeptember 30, 2022, $277 million, or 52\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $189 million, or\n36 percent, of nonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more past due and\nhad been written down to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, less costs\nto sell. Accruing loans that were 30\ndays or more past due decreased $74\nmillion during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\nNet recoveries decreased $16 million to\n$18 million and $21 million to $72\nmillion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022 compared to the\nsame periods in 2021.\n\nOf the $26.8 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nSeptember 30, 2022, as shown in Table\n21, 14 percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that have reached the end of\ntheir draw period and have entered the\namortization period was $5.5 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022. The HELOCs that have\nentered the amortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and nonperforming\nstatus when\n\ncompared to the HELOC portfolio as a\nwhole. At September 30, 2022, $47\nmillion, or one percent, of outstanding\nHELOCs that had entered the amortization\nperiod were accruing past due 30 days or\nmore. In addition, at September 30,\n2022, $380 million, or seven percent,\nwere nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, 21 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio. In the New York area, the New\nYork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA\nmade up 13 percent of the outstanding\nhome equity portfolio at both September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve a\nreduction in the customer\u2019s interest\nrate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other\nconsumer loans are made through programs\nutilizing direct customer contact, but\nmay also utilize external programs. At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, our credit card and other consumer\nTDR portfolio was $608 million and $672\nmillion, of which $533 million and $599\nmillion were current or less than 30\ndays past due under the modified terms.\n                                                                                  \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                    \n                                                                                  \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For\n\nmore information on our industry\nconcentrations, see Table 34 and\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations on\npage 39.\n\nFor more information on our accounting\npolicies regarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status, net charge-offs\nand TDRs for the commercial portfolio,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Commercial Credit Portfolio                                                     \n                                                                                  \nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2022, commercial credit quality\nimproved as charge-offs, nonperforming\ncommercial loans and reservable\ncriticized utilized exposure declined\nduring this period. Due to the ongoing\nRussia/Ukraine conflict, all direct\nexposure to Russian counterparties was\ndowngraded and reported as reservable\ncriticized exposure, and expected credit\nlosses have been incorporated into our\nestimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses. Outstanding commercial loans and\nleases increased $38.2 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022\ndue to growth in commercial and\nindustrial, primarily in Global Banking\n. This increase was partially offset by\nlower U.S. small business commercial\nloans due to repayments of PPP loans by\nthe Small Business Administration (SBA)\nunder the terms of the program. For more\ninformation on PPP loans, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the\n                                                                                  \n  35Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate\nborrowers continued to stabilize as\npandemic-impacted sectors are\nrecovering. However, many real estate\nmarkets, while improving, are still\nexperiencing disruptions in demand,\nsupply chain challenges, tenant\ndifficulties and challenging capital\nmarkets. Demand for office space\ncontinues to be uncertain as companies\nevaluate space needs with employment\nmodels that utilize a mix of remote and\nconventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses remained relatively\nunchanged at $5.4 billion at September\n30, 2022, as asset quality improvement\nand reduced pandemic uncertainties were\noffset by a dampening macroeconomic\noutlook, loan growth and a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 42.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $65.0 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022\nto $718.6 billion primarily driven by\nhigher loans and leases and derivative\nassets.

The increase of $165\nmillion in accruing past due 90 days or\nmore for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 was driven by PPP loans, which\nare fully guaranteed by the SBA.\nNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases\nand Foreclosed Properties Activity\nTable 32 presents the nonperforming\ncommercial loans, leases and foreclosed\nproperties activity during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2022 and\n2021. Nonperforming loans do not include\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, nonperforming\ncommercial loans and leases decreased\n$355 million to $1.2 billion. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, 98 percent of\ncommercial nonperforming loans, leases\nand foreclosed properties were secured\nand 56 percent were contractually\ncurrent. Commercial nonperforming loans\nwere carried at 86 percent of their\nunpaid principal balance, as the\ncarrying value of these loans has been\nreduced to the estimated collateral\nvalue less costs to sell.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America38                                                               \n

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased\nin our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $9.1 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $56 million and gains\nof $66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to\nnet losses of $18 million and $86 million for the same periods in 2021.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing\n\nactivities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of\nbusiness through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than\nthrough country risk governance.

Net country exposure\nfor these 20 countries increased $1.8\nbillion during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 primarily driven by\nincreases in Japan, the United Kingdom,\nIreland and India,

The\nincrease was primarily driven by net\ncounterparty exposure with financial\ninstitutions, partially offset by a\nreduction in deposits with the central\nbank. Our second\n\nlargest non-U.S. country exposure was\nGermany with net exposure of $33.5\nbillion at September 30, 2022, a $280\nmillion decrease from December 31, 2021.\nThe reduction was driven by a decrease\nin exposure with financial institutions\nand corporates, offset by an increase in\ndeposits with the central bank.\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses\ndecreased $26 million from December 31,\n2021 to $13.8 billion at September 30,\n2022, which included a $171 million\nreserve decrease related to the consumer\nportfolio and a $145 million reserve\nincrease related to the commercial\nportfolio. The decrease in the allowance\nwas primarily driven by asset quality\nimprovement and reduced\n\npandemic uncertainties, partially offset\nby reserve builds related to loan\ngrowth, a dampening

three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 were\n$520 million and $1.5 billion compared\nto $463 million and $1.9 billion for the\nsame periods in 2021. During the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, net\ncharge-offs increased $57 million, or 12\npercent, primarily due to overdrafts\ncharged off in other consumer. During\nthe nine months ended September 30,\n2022, net charge-offs decreased $398\nmillion, or 21 percent, primarily driven\nby lower credit card losses, as loss\nrates remained near historic lows. The\nprovision for credit losses increased\n$1.5 billion to an expense of $898\nmillion, and $5.6 billion to an expense\nof $1.5 billion for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 compared\nto the same periods in 2021. The\nprovision for credit losses for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2022\nwas primarily driven by loan growth and\na dampening macroeconomic outlook, and\nthe nine-month period was driven by the\nsame factors as well as a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure, partially\noffset by asset quality improvement and\nreduced pandemic uncertainties. For the\nsame periods in the prior year, the\nbenefit in the provision for credit\nlosses was due to an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook. The provision for\ncredit losses for the\n\nconsumer portfolio, including unfunded\nlending commitments, increased $641\nmillion to an expense of $722 million\nand $2.5 billion to an expense of $1.1\nbillion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022 compared to the\nsame periods in 2021. The provision for\ncredit losses for the commercial\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, increased $881 million to\nan expense of $176 million and $3.0\nbillion to an expense of $304 million\nfor the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 compared to the same\nperiods in 2021.\n\nTable 39 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021.

market risk\nmanagement process, see Market Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 40 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and\n\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio\nand the fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 40 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges.

Periodically, we evaluate the\nscenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar\ninterest rates are floored at zero.\nDepending on the level of interest\nrates, Down-rate scenarios may not\nreceive the full impact of the rate\nshock, particularly in low rate\nenvironments. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2022, the overall\ndecrease in asset sensitivity of our\nbalance sheet to Up-rate scenarios was\nprimarily due to an increase in long-end\nand short-end rates. We continue to be\nasset sensitive to a parallel upward\nmove in interest rates with the majority\nof that impact coming from the short end\nof the yield curve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates negatively impact the\nfair value of our debt securities\nclassified as available for sale and\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As\npart of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and\ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate\nsensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in\nalternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in\n\nour projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table\n43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast\nin alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity\nresulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with\nhigher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those\nscenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts We use interest\nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various\nassets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative\ncontracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest\nrates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our\nforeign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign\ncurrency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. The\nderivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories:\ndesignated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated\naccounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as\ndescribed in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and\nare included in the sensitivities presented in Table 43. The Corporation also uses\nforeign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in\nthis area is not significant. Risk management derivatives are predominantly used\nto hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated\nassets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures\nin the cash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other\nmarket risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk.\nHowever, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign\nexchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant.\nFor more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity\nand interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for\ninvestment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and\nliquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.\nChanges in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as\nwell as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged\nitems offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For\nmore information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage\nBanking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair\nvalue of MSR, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \nlosses on the hedge portfolio, for the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021.

These changes and events can\nhave broad impacts on operations, supply\nchains, distribution networks, customers\nand markets and are otherwise referred\nto, respectively, as transition risk and\nphysical risk. These risks can impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. The impacts of transition risk\ncan lead to and amplify credit risk or\nmarket risk by reducing our customers\u2019\noperating income or the value of their\nassets as well as expose us to\nreputational and/or litigation risk due\nto increased regulatory scrutiny or\nnegative public sentiment. Physical risk\ncan lead to increased credit risk by\ndiminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or impacting the value of\ncollateral. In addition, it could pose\nincreased operational risk to our\nfacilities and people.\n\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions in our\nfinancing activities, operations, and\nsupply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal)\nand set 2030 emissions targets for our\noperations and supply chain. In\nconnection with our Net Zero Goal, we\ncommitted to reduce emissions by 2030\nassociated with our financing activities\nrelated to auto manufacturing, energy,\nand power generation (2030 Targets). In\nour September 2022 Task Force on\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures\nreport, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020\nfinanced emissions and emissions\nintensity metrics for these sectors,\nwith 2019 serving as the baseline for\nour 2030 Targets.\n\nIn line with our participation in the\nNet Zero Banking Alliance, we plan to\ndisclose the financed emissions for\nadditional portions of our business loan\nportfolio in 2023, and we expect to set\nfinancing activity emission reduction\ntargets for other key sectors by April\n2024. These reduction targets are\nintended to align with the International\nEnergy Agency Net Zero Emissions 2050\nglobal pathway to limit warming to 1.5\ndegrees Celsius.\n\nAchieving our climate--related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero Goal and\n2030 Targets, will require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, public policies,\nincluding those that improve the cost of\ncapital for\n\nnet zero transition and better emissions\ndata reporting, as\n\nwell as ongoing, strong and active\nengagement with customers, suppliers,\ninvestors, government officials and\nother stakeholders.\n\nGiven the extended period of these and\nother climate-related goals we have\nestablished, our initiatives have not\nresulted in a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\ncondition in the relevant periods\npresented herein, and are not expected\nto have a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\ncondition in the near-term.\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework and climate risk management\nprocess, see the Managing Risk and\nClimate Risk Management sections in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and\n\ndisclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates\nand assumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the Corporation\u2019s\nbusiness is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a full year.\nIn the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current-\nperiod presentation. Accounting\nStandards Issued and Not Yet Adopted\nHedge Accounting The FASB issued a new\naccounting standard effective on January\n1, 2023, with early adoption permitted,\nthat makes targeted improvements to the\napplication of the fair value hedge\naccounting guidance for closed\nportfolios of financial assets. Upon\nadoption, the application of these hedge\nstrategies would be applied\nprospectively.

The Corporation also uses these\ntypes of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and\nliabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation\nhedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have\nfunctional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts\nand cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt\n(net investment hedges).

These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to\nprimarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For\nopen cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted\ntransactions are hedged is approximately seven years.

At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 4.8billion non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-\nbacked securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 4.9billion and $\n4.8billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nfair value of the transferred securities was $ 4.6billion and $ 5.0billion. Sales\nand Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate\nclient transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to include these derivative\ninstruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-\nderivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed\non a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global Markets business segment.\nFor more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash\ninstruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items\nattributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets ,\ncategorized by primary risk, for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2022 and 2021.

the\nCorporation for most credit derivatives.\nHowever, the Corporation does not\nmonitor its exposure to credit\nderivatives based solely on the notional\namount because this measure does not\ntake into consideration the probability\nof occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of\nthe Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is\nused to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit\nrisk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-\nrelated notes in the preceding table\ninclude investments in securities issued\nby collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as\ntrading securities. The carrying value\nof these instruments equals the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.\nThe Corporation is not obligated to make\nany payments to the entities under the\nterms of the securities owned. Credit-\nrelated Contingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s\nderivative contracts contain credit\nrisk-related contingent features,\nprimarily in the form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and credit support\ndocumentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n120.0billion and $ 91.4billion and\nposted cash and securities collateral of\n$ 85.8billion and $ 79.3billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends\non the contract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. At September 30, 2022, the amount\nof collateral, calculated based on the\nterms of the contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain subsidiaries\ncould be required to post to\ncounterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 4.0billion,\nincluding $ 2.5billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National Association (BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able\nto unilaterally terminate certain\ncontracts, or the Corporation or certain\n\nsubsidiaries may be required to take\nother action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee. At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the liability recorded for these\nderivative contracts was not\nsignificant.\nThe table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been\ncontractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at\nSeptember 30, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior\ndebt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch\nand by an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative\nliabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon\ndowngrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt\nratings.\n                                                                                  \n  Additional Collateral Required to be                                            \n  Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject                                       \n  to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade                                        \n  at September 30, 2022                                                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                           One            Second  \n  (Dollars in millions)                            Incremental       Incremental  \n                                                         Notch             Notch  \n  Additional collateral required to be                                            \n  posted upon downgrade                                                           \n  Bank of America Corporation                   $          430    $        1,043  \n  Bank of America, N.A. and                                199               789  \n  subsidiaries(1)                                                                 \n  Derivative liabilities subject to                                               \n  unilateral termination upon downgrade                                           \n  Derivative liabilities                        $           10    $          939  \n  Collateral posted                                          \u2014               629  \n                                                                                  \n(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.\nValuation Adjustments on Derivatives\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains\n(losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities),\nwhich are recorded in market making and similar activities, for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases Commercial\nnonperforming loans decreased to $ 1.2billion at September 30, 2022 from $\n1.6billion at December 31, 2021. Consumer nonperforming loans decreased to $\n2.8billion at September 30, 2022 from $ 3.0billion at December 31, 2021 primarily\ndue to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by\nincreases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified in TDRs during the\nfirst quarter of 2022. The following table presents the Corporation\u2019s\nnonperforming loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing\npast due 90days or more at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 residential mortgage includes $\n321million and $ 444million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 106million and $ 190million\nof loans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate,\nCredit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of\nfinancing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at September\n30, 2022, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an\nadditional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.\n                                                                                  \n  67Bank of America                                                               \n

Concessions may\ninclude reductions in interest rates,\ncapitalization of past due amounts,\nprincipal and/or interest forbearance,\npayment extensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or combinations\nthereof. Prior to permanently modifying\na loan, the Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with certain\nborrowers under both government and\nproprietary programs. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a\nthree- to four-month period during which\nthe borrower makes monthly payments\nunder the anticipated modified payment\nterms. Upon successful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation and the\nborrower enter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n224million that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by\nthe borrower were included in TDRs at\nSeptember 30, 2022, of which $ 56million\nwere classified as nonperforming and $\n38million were loans fully insured. At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, remaining commitments to lend\nadditional funds to debtors whose terms\nhave been modified in a consumer real\nestate TDR were not significant.\nConsumer real estate foreclosed\nproperties totaled $ 125million and $\n101million at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including\nfully-insured loans, for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in process\nat September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021 was $ 946million and $ 1.1billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 151million and $\n33million of consumer real estate loans\nto foreclosed properties or, for\nproperties acquired upon foreclosure of\ncertain government-guaranteed loans\n(principally FHA-insured loans), to\nother assets. The reclassifications\nrepresent non-cash investing activities\nand, accordingly, are not reflected in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlows.

Credit card and other consumer loan\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the\ncustomer\u2019s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs.

Additionally, the Corporation makes loan\nmodifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nprovide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external\nprograms). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral\nvalue and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

accrued interest and fees.\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are\ndeemed to be in payment default during\nthe quarter in which a borrower misses\nthe second of twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 12percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 20percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing the\nborrower with an\nopportunity to work through financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid foreclosure\nor bankruptcy. Each modification is\nunique and reflects the individual\ncircumstances of the borrower.\nModifications that result in a TDR may\ninclude extensions of maturity at a\nconcessionary (below market) rate of\ninterest, payment forbearances or other\nactions designed to benefit the borrower\nwhile mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk\nexposure. Reductions in interest rates\nare rare. Instead, the interest rates\nare typically increased, although the\nincreased rate may not represent a\nmarket rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal\nforgiveness in connection with\nforeclosure, short sale or other\nsettlement agreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the loan.\n                                                                                  \n  73Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAt the time of restructuring, the loans\nare remeasured to reflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash flows resulting\nfrom the modified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded at the time\nof restructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already been\nrecorded in a previous period such that\nno charge-off is required at the time of\nmodification. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, the\ncarrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were modified as\nTDRs was $ 745million and $ 1.7billion\ncompared to $ 213million and $\n1.1billion for the same periods in 2021.\nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Corporation had commitments to\nlend $ 347million and $ 283million to\ncommercial borrowers whose loans were\nclassified as TDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment default was $\n117million and $ 262million at September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Loans\nHeld-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS\nof $ 7.6billion and $ 15.6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Cash and non-cash proceeds from\nsales and paydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $ 27.8billion\nand $ 27.0billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Cash\nused for originations and purchases of\nLHFS totaled $ 18.7billion and $\n27.0billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021. Also\nincluded were non-cash net transfers\ninto LHFS of $ 2.1billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022,\nprimarily driven by the transfer of a $\n1.6billion affinity card loan portfolio\nto held for sale that was sold in\nOctober 2022, and $ 804million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021.\nAccrued Interest Receivable Accrued\ninterest receivable for loans and leases\nand loans held-for-sale at September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 was $\n3.0billion and $ 2.2billion and is\nreported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022, the\nCorporation reversed $ 81million and $\n241million of interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item\nin which it was originally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal balance of\nthe loan compared to $ 87million and $\n369million for the same periods in 2021\n.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021, interest and fee\nincome reversed at the time the loans\nwere classified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the\n\nCorporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions. The\nCorporation incorporates forward-looking\ninformation through the use of several\nmacroeconomic scenarios in determining\nthe weighted economic outlook over the\nforecasted life of the assets. These\nscenarios include key macroeconomic\nvariables such as gross domestic\nproduct, unemployment rate, real estate\nprices and corporate bond spreads. The\nscenarios that are chosen each quarter\nand the weighting given to each scenario\ndepend on a variety of factors including\nrecent economic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The September 30, 2022 estimate\nfor allowance for credit losses was\nbased on various economic outlooks that\nincluded a baseline scenario derived\nfrom consensus estimates, a moderate\nrecession scenario, a downside scenario\nto account for persistent inflation and\ninterest rates at levels above what is\nfactored into the baseline, and a tail\nrisk scenario. In addition, an upside\nscenario considers the potential for\nimprovement in the consensus outlooks.\nThe weighted economic outlook assumes\nthat the U.S. average unemployment rate\nwill be above fivepercent in the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and fall just below\nfivepercent by the end of 2024.\nAdditionally, in this economic outlook,\nU.S. gross domestic product is\nforecasted to grow at 0.2percent and\n1.5percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2023 and 2024. While asset\nquality continues to improve and the\npandemic appears to have largely\ndissipated, uncertainty remains\nregarding broader economic impacts as a\nresult of inflationary pressures, rising\nrates and the current geopolitical\nsituation and could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality metrics in\nfuture periods. As such, the Corporation\nhas factored the aforementioned\nuncertainties into its allowance for\ncredit losses. The allowance for credit\nlosses at September 30, 2022 was $\n13.8billion, a decrease of $ 26million\ncompared to December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses was primarily driven by asset\nquality improvement and reduced pandemic\nuncertainties, partially offset by\nreserve builds related to loan growth, a\ndampening macroeconomic outlook and\nRussian exposure. The change in the\nallowance for credit losses was\ncomprised of a net decrease of $\n85million in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a $ 59million increase\nin the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The decrease in the\nallowance for credit losses was\nattributed to $ 191million in the\nconsumer real estate portfolio,\npartially offset by an increase of $\n20million in the credit card and other\nconsumer portfolio, and an increase of $\n145million in the commercial portfolio.\nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $ 1.5billion to an expense of\n$ 898million, and $ 5.6billion to an\nexpense of $ 1.5billion for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2022\ncompared to the same periods in 2021.\nThe provision for credit losses for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2022\nwas primarily driven by loan growth and\na dampening macroeconomic outlook, and\nthe nine-month period was driven by the\nsame factors as well as a reserve build\nrelated to Russian exposure, partially\noffset by asset quality improvement and\nreduced pandemic uncertainties. For the\nsame periods in the prior year, the\nbenefit in the provision for credit\nlosses was due to an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America74                                                               \n                                                                                  \nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value\noption increased $ 56.3billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022\ndriven by commercial loans, which increased $ 40.9billion, driven by broad-based\ngrowth, and consumer loans, which increased $ 15.4billion, primarily driven by\nresidential mortgage and credit card.

The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the sale\nor securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of\nloans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity\nloans, totaled $ 102.6billion and $ 129.6billion at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nServicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 71million and $\n215million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $\n101million and $ 318million for the same periods in 2021.

of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans and leases in the\nconsolidated credit card trust included $ 4.2billion and $ 4.3billion of seller\u2019s\ninterest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s\ninterest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables\nand cash reserve accounts. Senior debt securities totaling $ 1.0billion were\nissued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. At both September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the\ncredit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $ 6.5billion.\nThese securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt\nsecurities and have a stated interest rate of zeropercent. There were $ 161million\nof subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Resecuritization Trusts The\nCorporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed\nin a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 5.3billion and $ 19.5billion\nof securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared\nto $ 5.9billion and $ 20.6billion for the same periods in 2021. Securities\ntransferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in\nfair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the\nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, resecuritization\nproceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $ 670million and $\n2.4billion compared to $ 1.0billion and $ 1.6billion, of which substantially all\nof the securities were classified as trading account assets for both periods and\ncategorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The\nCorporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term,\nfixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate\ntrust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-\nparty investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated\nmunicipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor,\ntotaled $ 3.1billion and $ 4.1billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at September 30,\n2022 was 7.9years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets\nor issuers during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Customer VIEs include\ncredit-linked, equity-linked and\ncommodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging\nVIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which\nare typically created on behalf of\ncustomers who wish to obtain market or\ncredit exposure to a specific company,\nindex, commodity or financial\ninstrument. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n999million and $ 2.9billion at September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nincluding the notional amount of\nderivatives to which the Corporation is\na counterparty, net of losses previously\nrecorded, and the Corporation\u2019s\ninvestment, if any, in securities issued\nby the VIEs. Collateralized Debt\nObligation VIEs The Corporation receives\nfees for structuring CDO VIEs, which\nhold diversified pools of fixed-income\nsecurities, typically corporate debt or\nABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed\nby third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets\nto these CDOs, holds securities issued\nby the CDOs and may be a derivative\ncounterparty to the CDOs. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs\ntotaled $ 111million and $ 235million at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Investment VIEs The Corporation\nsponsors, invests in or provides\nfinancing, which may be in connection\nwith the sale of assets, to a variety of\ninvestment VIEs that hold loans, real\nestate, debt securities or other\nfinancial instruments and are designed\nto provide the desired investment\nprofile to investors or the Corporation.\nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $\n665million and $ 1.0billion. The\nCorporation also held investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 7.9billion and $ 7.1billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure associated with both\nconsolidated and unconsolidated\ninvestment VIEs totaled $ 1.8billion and\n$ 2.0billion at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 comprised primarily of\non-balance sheet assets less non-\nrecourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease\nTrusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts\ntotaled $ 1.3billion and $ 1.5billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The trusts hold long-lived\nequipment such as rail cars, power\ngeneration and distribution equipment,\nand commercial aircraft. The Corporation\nstructures the trusts and holds a\nsignificant residual interest. The net\ninvestment represents the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged\nlease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is\nnon-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds\ninvestments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that\nconstruct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, wind and solar projects. An\n\nunrelated third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. The Corporation\nearns a return primarily through the\nreceipt of tax credits allocated to the\nprojects. The maximum loss exposure\nincluded in the Other VIEs table was $\n26.5billion and $ 25.7billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is\ngenerally mitigated by policies\nrequiring that the project qualify for\nthe expected tax credits prior to making\nits investment. The Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in affordable housing\npartnerships, which are reported in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, totaled $ 13.4billion and $\n12.6billion, including unfunded\ncommitments to provide capital\ncontributions of $ 6.3billion and $\n5.8billion, at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The unfunded\ncommitments are expected to be paid over\nthe next five years. During the three\nand nine months ended September 30,\n2022, the Corporation recognized tax\ncredits and other tax benefits from\ninvestments in affordable housing\npartnerships of $ 409million and $\n1.2billion and reported pretax losses in\nother income of $ 311million and $\n938million. For the same periods in\n2021, the Corporation recognized tax\ncredits and other tax benefits of $\n350million and $ 1.1billion and reported\npretax losses in other income of $\n282million and $ 837million. These tax\ncredits are recognized as part of the\nCorporation\u2019s annual effective tax rate\nused to determine tax expense in a given\nquarter. The Corporation may be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant.

that\nit is permitted by contract or practice\nto sell or repledge. At September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of this collateral was $\n774.4billion and $ 854.8billion, of\nwhich $ 712.4billion and $ 782.7billion\nwere sold or repledged. The primary\nsource of this collateral is securities\nborrowed or purchased under agreements\nto resell. For more information on\ncollateral, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation held restricted cash\nincluded within cash and cash\nequivalents on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet of $ 6.6billion and $ 5.9billion,\npredominantly related to cash segregated\nin compliance with securities\nregulations and cash held on deposit\nwith central banks to meet reserve\nrequirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nCredit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.4billion and $ 10.7billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s credit extension\ncommitments at both September 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\nvalue option, were $ 1.5billion, which\npredominantly related to the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these commitments is\nclassified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Legally binding commitments to\nextend credit generally have specified\nrates and maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 3.5billion and $\n4.8billion at September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 that are accounted for\nunder the fair value option. However,\nthe table excludes the cumulative net\nfair value for these commitments of $\n200million and $ 97million at September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, which is\nclassified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

guarantees classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 26.4billion and $\n10.1billion at September 30, 2022, and $ 26.3billion and $ 8.7billion at December\n31, 2021. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 534million and $\n512million at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 655million and $ 181million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 395million and $ 518million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural\ngas, of $ 253million and $ 949million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $ 89.5billion and $ 92.0billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 70.1billion and $ 32.6billion. These commitments generally expire\nwithin the next 12 months. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 3.7billion and $\n4.0billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic\npartner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with\n12months prior notice. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 720million and $\n395million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The\nCorporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers\nwho offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amount of these guarantees\ntotaled $ 4.4billion and $ 6.3billion. At September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $\n650million and $ 928million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039.\nMerchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor\nof other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that\ncannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud\nor insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be\ncollected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be\nheld liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable payment network rules and regulations, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time\nlimits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network\nrules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was\napproximately $ 509billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure as of September 30, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily\nrelates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for\nfuture delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. Representations and\nWarranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial\n                                                                                  \n  83Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve\nfor representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees was\n$ 1.0billion and $ 1.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nand is included in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, and the related provision\nis included in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions, and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 38.6billion and $ 42.0billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Other Guarantees In the normal\ncourse of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations\nof its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related\ntransactions and non-ISDA related\ntransactions such as commodities\ntrading, repurchase agreements, prime\nbrokerage agreements and other\ntransactions. Guarantees of Certain\nLong-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities issued by certain\nstatutory trust companies that are\n100percent owned finance subsidiaries of\nthe Corporation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure).\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters below\nand the matters disclosed in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation-related expense of\n$ 507million and $ 1.1billion was\nrecognized for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022 compared to $\n66million and $ 155million for the same\nperiods in 2021. For any matter\ndisclosed in this Note and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nfor which a loss in future periods is\nreasonably possible and estimable\n(whether in excess of an accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued\nliability) and for representations and\nwarranties exposures, the Corporation\u2019s\nestimated range of possible loss is $\n0to $ 0.7billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any, as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. The accrued\nliability and estimated range of\npossible loss are based upon currently\navailable information and subject to\nsignificant judgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and unknown\nuncertainties. The matters underlying\nthe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are unpredictable\nand may change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly\nfrom the current estimate and accrual.\nThe estimated range of possible loss\ndoes not represent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure. Information is\nprovided below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the litigation\nand, where specified, associated claimed\ndamages. Based on current knowledge, and\ntaking into account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nbelow and in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of those matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthose matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America84                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAmbac Bond Insurance Litigation Ambac v.\nCountrywide I Ambac v. Countrywide II\nAmbac v. First Franklin On October 6,\n2022, the Corporation and certain wholly\nowned subsidiaries entered into an\nagreement with Ambac Assurance\nCorporation (together with its\nsubsidiaries, \u201cAmbac\u201d) to resolve the\nabove referenced matters. Under the\nterms of the agreement, in exchange for\nthe Corporation\u2019s payment of $\n1.84billion, Ambac, among other things,\ncaused these matters to be dismissed\nwith prejudice, and released the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries from\nall outstanding claims related to\nAmbac\u2019s issuance of bond insurance\npolicies for certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s and legacy entities\u2019\nsecuritized pools of residential\nmortgage loans. Prepaid Debit Card\nInvestigations On July 14, 2022, BANA\nagreed to settle twoseparate proceedings\nwith the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC) and Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nrelated to BANA\u2019s administration of\nprepaid debit cards to distribute\nunemployment benefits. The orders found\nthat BANA\u2019s fraud prevention measures\nand resolution of potentially\nunauthorized transactions improperly\ndelayed or denied access by certain\ncardholders to account funds. Without\nadmitting or denying the findings, BANA\nconsented to orders requiring it to\nimprove its processes, review accounts\nand compensate cardholders, and pay\npenalties of $ 125million and $\n100million to the OCC and CFPB,\nrespectively. The Corporation continues\nto defend civil litigation, including\nputative class actions, concerning\nBANA\u2019s administration of these prepaid\ndebit card programs. Record-keeping\nInvestigations Certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries have\nbeen cooperating with investigations by\nthe SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (CFTC) regarding\ncompliance by financial institutions\nwith record-keeping obligations for\nbroker-dealers, investment advisors,\nswap dealers and futures commission\nmerchants pertaining to business-related\nelectronic communications sent over\nunapproved electronic messaging\nchannels. On September 27, 2022, these\nsubsidiaries entered into resolutions\nwith the SEC and CFTC to resolve their\nrespective civil investigations. The SEC\nand CFTC found that BofA Securities,\nInc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner &\nSmith\n\nIncorporated did not maintain copies of\ncertain communications required to be\nmaintained under their respective\nrecord-keeping rules, where such\ncommunications were sent or received by\nemployees over electronic messaging\nchannels that had not been approved for\nemployee use. The CFTC resolution also\nincludes BANA. The SEC and CFTC also\nfound related supervision failures.\nUnder these resolutions, a $ 125million\ncivil monetary penalty was paid to the\nSEC, and a $ 100million civil monetary\npenalty was paid to the CFTC.

or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly\n\ntransaction between market participants\non the measurement date. The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if\nthe significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent marketplace. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, there\nwere no changes to valuation approaches\nor techniques that had, or are expected\nto have, a material impact\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America86                                                               \n                                                                                  \non the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations. For\nmore information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the Corporation measures\nfair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nCorporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value\noption. For more information, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value Option .
