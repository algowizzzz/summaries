Letter from our Lead Independent        \nDirector The independent directors and I join Brian in inviting you to attend our \ncompany\u2019s 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Bank of America\u2019s Board of         \nDirectors is committed to building long-term value in the company through our     \ncontinued focus on Responsible Growth, and values input from our shareholders as  \nthe company executes our strategy. As the Board\u2019s Lead Independent Director, I    \nmeet with shareholders throughout the year to discuss the Board\u2019s focus on        \ngovernance practices and our oversight of the company\u2019s drive for Responsible     \nGrowth. During these meetings, I also hear from shareholders on the things that   \nmatter to them most and share these viewpoints with the Board to enhance our      \noversight. During 2023 and early 2024, I was joined by Monica Lozano, Chair of the\nBoard\u2019s Compensation and Human Capital Committee, in dialogue with shareholders.  \nTogether with management, we met with holders of approximately 47% of our         \ninstitutionally held shares. We discussed the Board\u2019s composition and our         \noversight of the company\u2019s progress toward its commitment to net zero greenhouse  \ngas emissions by 2050 in its financing activities, operations, and supply chain.  \nIn response to the results of our 2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote, our dialogue also       \nfocused on Board and Committee oversight of Bank of America\u2019s executive           \ncompensation practices and disclosures. I greatly appreciate the time taken by our\ninvestors to provide the Board with valuable insight on how they believe our      \ncompany can improve, and I look forward to our continued dialogue. On behalf of   \nthe Board, thank you for choosing to invest in Bank of America. On behalf of our  \nBoard, we would like to share a tribute to our friend and colleague, Frank        \nBramble, a 17-yearmember of the Board who passed away last year. Frank was a      \ndeeply committed member of our Board. We are grateful to Frank for his years of   \nservice and contributions as Chair of the Board\u2019s Corporate Governance, ESG, and  \nSustainability Committee, and prior to that, as Chair of our Board\u2019s Enterprise   \nRisk Committee. We have greatly benefited from his judgment and counsel.          \n                                               \n  BRIAN T.

The Board has adopted thoughtful governance practices  \nand processes consistent with our drive for Responsible Growth and implemented a  \nnumber of measures to enrich its composition, enhance independent oversight, and  \nincrease its effectiveness. These measures align our corporate governance         \nstructure with achieving our strategic objectives, and facilitate our Board\u2019s     \nindependent oversight of our culture of compliance and rigorous risk management.  \nThoughtful, interconnected governance processes                                   \n                        \n  4    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                        \n                           \n  Proxy\u00a0statement\u00a0summary  \n                           \nCompensation highlights Shareholder engagement and \u201cSay on Pay\u201d We have a long    \nhistory of strong shareholder support for our Board\u2019s pay-for-performance         \nphilosophy, as accomplished through our executive compensation design and         \ndecisions. From 2011 to 2022, support for our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal averaged      \n94.2%, with the lowest level of support being 92.9% in 2011 and 2012. In          \nrecognition of this continued support as well as input from engagement with       \ninstitutional shareholders, for 2022, our Board maintained a consistent executive \ncompensation design and in applying its pay-for-performance philosophy, decreased \nthe overall pay to Mr. Moynihan by approximately 6%. Compensation for that year\u2019s \nother named executive officers also decreased between approximately 5% and 7%     \nbased on 2022 performance. Leading up to our 2023 annual meeting, two U.S. proxy  \nadvisory firms recommended\u2014for the first time ever\u2014that their subscribers vote    \n\u201cagainst\u201d our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. We believe these recommendations contributed \nsignificantly to the lower support received in 2023, as some of our institutional \ninvestors follow the voting recommendations of these firms and some others are    \ninfluenced by their analyses and recommendations. In total, of the approximately  \n5.7 billion votes cast at the meeting, 69.1% favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In\nlight of the result of our 2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote, which differed significantly   \nfrom our prior history, and in order to ascertain the reasons for the decline, we \nintentionally refocused our 2023 and early 2024 shareholder engagements more      \ndirectly on our executive compensation program and disclosures than in prior      \nyears. We specifically solicited input on our executive compensation program as   \npart of our engagement agenda, welcoming dialogue from those who both supported   \nand did not support our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal last year. Our Lead Independent     \nDirector and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee Chair played a central  \nrole in these discussions. For more information about our shareholder engagement, \nsee \u201dShareholder engagement\u201d on page 37 and \u201cCompensation discussion and          \nanalysis\u2014Executive summary\u201d on page 54. Overall, investors expressed their        \nunderstanding and support for our compensation program and structure and its      \nalignment with the tenets of Responsible Growth. We focused on listening to       \nshareholders to understand why they voted against \u201cSay on Pay\u201d last year, and to  \nconfirm their expectations of an appropriate response to regain support. We       \nreceived specific input on two key areas that contributed to a lower \u201cSay on Pay\u201d \nvote result in 2023: 1) one-time awards and 2) transparency in the pay decision   \nprocess. This input, along with a range of perspectives and suggestions received  \nduring our shareholder engagement, informed the Committee as it implemented       \nenhancements to our 2023 compensation program and disclosures.

Our performance\nconsiderations include both financial and non-financial measures\u2014including the    \nmanner in which results are achieved. These considerations are designed to        \nreinforce and promote Responsible Growth and maintain alignment with our Risk     \nFramework. Our executive compensation program provides a mix of salary,           \nincentives, and benefits paid over time to align executive officer and shareholder\ninterests. A majority of variable compensation granted to named executive officers\nis in deferred equity-based awards, further encouraging long-term focus on        \ngenerating sustainable growth.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                          In recognition of strong company        \n                                          performance in delivering Responsible   \n                                          Growth, and the CEO\u2019s individual        \n                                          performance, the Compensation and       \n                                          Human Capital Committee and the         \n                                          Board\u2019s independent directors           \n                                          determined the following 2023           \n                                          compensation for our CEO:               \n  \u2022 Total compensation, inclusive of                                              \n  base                                                                            \n  salary and equity-based incentives, of                                          \n  $29.0 million, down 3% compared to                                              \n  2022                                                                            \n  \u2022 The Compensation and Human Capital                                            \n  Committee and Board undertook a robust                                          \n  performance evaluation and decision                                             \n  process, which included a detailed                                              \n  review of performance results under                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  four tenets of Responsible Growth \u2022                                             \n  The                                                                             \n  performance evaluation considered the                                           \n  \u201cWhat,\u201d which includes a thorough                                               \n  evaluation of performance against                                               \n  scorecard metrics, and the \u201cHow,\u201d                                               \n  which                                                                           \n  includes the manner in which results,                                           \n  both financial and non-financial, were                                          \n  achieved \u2022 94.8% of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s                                              \n  total                                                                           \n  compensation is variable and directly                                           \n  linked to company performance.

To \ncarry out its responsibilities and set the tone at the top, our Board is keenly   \nfocused on its composition, its leadership structure, and succession planning. The\nBoard regularly reviews its composition, and through its Corporate Governance,    \nESG, and Sustainability Committee identifies and recommends director candidates   \nfor nomination using a director selection process that has been reviewed with our \nprimary bank regulators. The Board, in coordination with its committees, also     \nregularly considers Board leadership succession planning and committee membership \ncomposition. Board composition Our Board believes directors should possess high   \npersonal integrity and character, demonstrated management and leadership ability, \nextensive experience within our industry and across sectors, and the ability to   \nexercise sound and independent judgment in a collegial manner. Our Board:         \n                                                                                  \n       seeks directors whose complementary knowledge, experience, and skills      \n  \u2022    provide a broad range of perspectives and leadership expertise in areas    \n       important to our company\u2019s strategy and oversight.                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       assesses directors\u2019 age and tenure to provide for continuity in the        \n  \u2022    boardroom and to achieve a balance between the perspectives of newer       \n       directors and those of longer-serving directors.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    evaluates whether directors are able to devote the time necessary to       \n       discharge their duties.                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee follows  \napplicable regulations in confirming that our Board includes members who are      \nindependent, possess financial literacy and expertise, understand risk management \nprinciples, policies, and practices, and have experience in identifying,          \nassessing, and managing risk exposures. Key considerations informing the Board\u2019s  \napproach Director experience, skills, and expertise.When evaluating and           \nidentifying director candidates, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee considers the experiences, skills, and expertise that are critical to   \nthe Board\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of the company and are directly\nrelevant to our business, strategy, and operations. The Committee seeks candidates\nwith experiences, skills, and expertise in financial services and other global,   \nhighly complex and regulated industries, strategic planning and business          \ndevelopment, business operations, marketing and distribution, technology,         \ncybersecurity, risk management and financial controls, human capital management,  \ncorporate governance, and public policy. Director diversity.Our Board views       \ndiversity, including diversity of thought, perspective, and experience, as a      \npriority. Through the Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, the\nBoard regularly assesses its diversity and seeks representation across a range of \nattributes when identifying and evaluating director candidates. The Committee     \ndemonstrates this commitment to diversity by requesting the inclusion of diverse  \ncandidates in its consideration of potential directors in its work with third-    \nparty search firms. (See information on the next page for the Committee\u2019s         \nengagement with external search firms.) When evaluating director candidates, the  \nCommittee reviews available or self-identified information regarding each         \ncandidate, including, but not limited to, professional qualifications, experience,\nand expertise as well as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, national origin,   \nsexual orientation, military service, and other diverse characteristics. Director \ntime commitment.Our Board understands the time commitment involved in serving on  \nthe Board and its committees. Through the Committee, the Board evaluates whether  \ncandidates and serving directors are able to devote the time necessary to         \ndischarge their duties as directors, taking into account their primary            \noccupations, memberships on other boards, and other responsibilities. In 2022, at \nthe Committee\u2019s recommendation, our Board amended its policy on outside board     \nservice set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The revised policy      \nlimits the maximum number of public company boards on which a director on our     \nBoard may serve to four public companies (including our Board) and specifies that \nany public company chief executive officer who serves as a director on our Board  \nmay not serve on the boards of more than two public companies (including our      \nBoard).                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n  The Committee                                                                   \n  assesses                                                                        \n  directors\u2019 time                                                                 \n  commitment to the                                                               \n  Board throughout                                                                \n  the                                                                             \n  year, including                                                                 \n  through the                                                                     \n  annual                                                                          \n  formal                                                                          \n  self-evaluation                                                                 \n  process and prior                                                               \n  to the annual                                                                   \n  renomination of                                                                 \n  currently                                                                       \n  serving                                                                         \n  directors.

Our Board considers directors and director nominees \u201cindependent\u201d if\nthey meet the criteria for independence in both the NYSE listing standards and our\nCategorical Standards.

Our Board embraces multiple, interlinked\npractices that support the Board\u2019s effective functioning as a whole and engender  \nstrong and objective Board oversight. These practices include:                    \n                                                                                  \n       Regular reviews of our Board leadership structure and governance           \n  \u2022    practices, taking into account contemporaneous shareholder and             \n       stakeholder perspectives;                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A robust, well-defined, and transparent Lead Independent Director          \n       structure that applies when our Chair is not an independent director and   \n       that empowers the Lead Independent Director with extensive authority and   \n  \u2022    responsibilities.

The Lead Independent Director regularly convenes and presides    \n       over executive sessions of our independent directors outside the presence  \n       of management and our CEO, and develops topics for discussion during       \n  \u2022    these closed sessions. In addition, the Lead Independent Director holds    \n       regular discussions with our other independent directors in between Board  \n       meetings, meets with our CEO at least monthly and with other members of    \n       management at least quarterly, has regular calls with our primary bank     \n       regulators, and plays a central role in overseeing and participating in    \n       shareholder engagement efforts;                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A Board composed of diverse, experienced, and skilled directors, all of    \n       whom stand for election annually and all of whom are independent aside     \n       from the CEO. Each standing committee of the Board is presided over by an  \n  \u2022    independent chair and is composed entirely of independent directors.       \n       Under this approach, independent directors are empowered and entrusted     \n       with oversight of critical issues that are within the purview of these     \n       committees; and                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       A robust Board and committee formal self-evaluation process and            \n  \u2022    thoughtful director succession practices as described on pages\u00a028 and 10,  \n       respectively, of this proxy statement.                                     \n                                                                                  \nWe believe these practices, coupled with our Board\u2019s other governance processes,  \nprovide for strong, independent Board leadership and effective engagement with,   \nand oversight of, management. Our Board leadership structure Our Bylaws provide   \nthat our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board leadership structure    \nbest suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and our Board. This     \nBylaw provision was ratified by our shareholders at a 2015 special meeting called \nsolely for that purpose. Our shareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing   \nthis flexibility by voting against shareholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments \nrequiring an independent Chair at each of our 2017, 2018, and 2023 annual meetings\nof shareholders. At least annually, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate \nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, deliberates on and discusses the   \nappropriate Board leadership structure, including the considerations described    \nabove. Our Board\u2019s optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect   \nour company\u2019s evolving needs, strategy, and the operating environment; changes in \nour Board\u2019s composition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the    \nperspectives of shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board evaluates the      \nBoard\u2019s leadership structure at least annually to determine what, if any, changes \nare appropriate based on the then-existing needs and circumstances of our company \nand our Board and input from shareholders and other stakeholders. If at any time  \nthe Board\u2019s review of its leadership structure resulted in the conclusion that an \nindependent Chair would best serve the interests of our shareholders based on the \ncompany\u2019s needs and circumstances at that time, the Board would appoint an        \nindependent Chair. Under our Board\u2019s current leadership structure, we have a Chair\nand a Lead Independent Director. Our Board, through its annual assessment, with   \ninput from shareholders, believes that the existing structure continues to be the \noptimal leadership framework at this time. Our Lead Independent Director, Mr.     \nNowell, exemplifies objective, independent Board leadership and effectively       \nengages with and oversees management. Mr. Nowell leads the other independent      \ndirectors in providing objective oversight of management, reviewing the CEO\u2019s     \nperformance, determining and approving CEO compensation, helping to establish our \ncompany\u2019s long-term strategy and regularly assessing its effectiveness, and       \nserving the best interests of our company and our shareholders by overseeing      \nmanagement\u2019s work to create long-term value. He is joined by our Chair, Mr.       \nMoynihan, who, as CEO, serves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term    \nstrategy and Responsible Growth. Mr. Moynihan brings deep experience and          \nleadership in and knowledge of the financial services industry, our company, its  \nbusinesses, and our focus on Responsible Growth. He is a global leader who is     \nhelping drive progress toward the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals   \n(UN SDG), including serving on (and formerly chairing) the World Economic Forum\u2019s \n(WEF) International Business Council, which is leading efforts on standardization \nof UN SDG disclosures, and is chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative.        \n                         \n  26    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nEmpowered and highly-engaged Lead Independent Director As our Lead Independent    \nDirector, Mr. Nowell, is empowered with and exercises robust, well-defined duties \nformalized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

The two components of\nthe process are complementary. The ongoing, year-round part of the process allows \nfor real-time feedback and response. The formal, annual component, developed and  \nadministered under the direction of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and            \nSustainability Committee, assesses the Board\u2019s effectiveness against              \ncharacteristics frequently identified with highly effective boards (see next      \npage). The Committee examines annually the areas of focus for the self-evaluation \nand reviews industry trends, practices of peers, investors\u2019 views, and regulatory \ndevelopments related to boards and committees\u2019 self-evaluations and determines the\nscope and format of the Board\u2019s formal self-evaluation. Our Board and our Board   \ncommittees continuously evaluate their own effectiveness throughout the year      \n                         \n  28    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nAreas of focus\u2014characteristics of highly effective boards Research previously     \ncommissioned by the Board identified a broad set of characteristics frequently    \nidentified with highly effective boards. Those characteristics were grouped into  \nthe five key categories set forth below; the Board\u2019s formal annual self-evaluation\nwas organized around these five categories. Composition. Through the self-        \nevaluation process, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills, and          \nexperiences of potential director candidates that are consistent with the         \ncompany\u2019s current strategy and Responsible Growth, that allow the Board to        \neffectively perform its risk oversight responsibilities, and that add to the      \nBoard\u2019s diversity. Our Board also assesses its overall director recruitment and   \nsuccession planning processes, committee composition, and its optimal size. Board \nculture. Our Board considers its role in setting the standard for the company\u2019s   \nculture and values, including by evaluating interactions among directors and with \nmembers of management. Directors assess the effectiveness of the Board in         \nestablishing a collegial and collaborative dynamic that promotes open discussion  \nand debate, values independent judgment, and emphasizes accountability. Directors \nalso assess how they interact with management and challenge and hold management   \naccountable. Focus. During the formal annual self-evaluation process, our Board   \nand committees consider their effectiveness in performing key oversight           \nresponsibilities in a number of areas, including strategy, risk, environmental and\nsocial sustainability, and management talent and succession planning. They        \nevaluate the sufficiency of information received and the time spent in these areas\nand provide input on additional information and resources desired to support their\noversight responsibilities. Throughout the year, directors also regularly reassess\ntheir oversight focus by engaging in dialogue with management, soliciting input   \nfrom shareholders and other stakeholders, and receiving third-party perspectives  \non the competitive environment, opportunities for growth, macroeconomic trends,   \nand geopolitics. Process. As part of the formal annual self-evaluation process,   \ndirectors review overall Board and committee structure, the allocation of meeting \ntime, cadence of meetings, and other meeting processes. Through the annual and    \nongoing year-round evaluation processes, directors have provided input on process \nenhancements to allow ample time during meetings for discussion, debate, and in-  \ndepthreview of key topics and trends, and to facilitate focus on specific         \nstrategic topics. In addition to the Board\u2019s formal self-evaluation process, each \ndirector also has the opportunity to meet with and provide input to management,   \nour Lead Independent Director, and the committee chairs through a combination of  \nexecutive sessions and one-on-onemeetings. Information and resources. Through the \nself-evaluation process, our Board and committees assess the quality of meeting   \nmaterials and presentations and the overall amount and type of information,       \neducation, and training opportunities they receive both from management and       \noutside advisors and experts. Our directors continue to highlight the need for    \nclear, comprehensive, and concise information to effectively support their        \noversight responsibilities, including understandable and streamlined materials    \nthat identify key issues. They also have provided information about additional    \nresources, including opportunities to hear from third parties, that they believe  \nwill support their oversight responsibilities. Enhancements made in response to   \nformal Board self-evaluations Our directors and management work together to       \nrespond to the Board and committees self-evaluation results. In response to the   \nformal and informal components of the Board\u2019s self-evaluation processes in 2023,  \nwe have:                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                               Continued to support directors\u2019 discussion and     \n  Composition                  decision-making on Board succession planning and   \n                               committee membership, including a focus on future  \n                               needs and alignment with the company\u2019s strategy.   \n                               Provided more opportunities for our Board to       \n                               interact with senior management and emerging       \n  Board\u00a0culture                talent, both formally and informally, to           \n                               strengthen relationships and support the Board\u2019s   \n                               talent and succession planning responsibilities.   \n                               Enhanced discussion about areas of emerging risk   \n                               at Board and Enterprise Risk Committee meetings,   \n                               including in-depth reviews of key topics such as   \n                               climate risk, risks arising from the               \n                               macroeconomic environment, and technology and      \n                               cybersecurity risks, including artificial          \n                               intelligence. \u00a0 Added more frequent discussions    \n  Focus                        on environmental topics at the Board and           \n                               committee level including regular updates on       \n                               implementation of the company\u2019s sustainability     \n                               initiatives and climate activities and updates on  \n                               new climate disclosure requirements. \u00a0 Conducted   \n                               analyses and implemented changes in certain        \n                               compliance risk oversight responsibilities to      \n                               better coordinate and enhance Audit Committee and  \n                               Enterprise Risk Committee oversight.               \n                               Enhanced the structure of strategic planning       \n                               sessions to facilitate directors\u2019 and              \n                               managements\u2019 thorough review and discussion of     \n                               the company\u2019s strategy and address topics          \n                               identified by directors as desired areas of        \n                               increased focus, including related to current      \n                               economic conditions, the company\u2019s balance sheet,  \n  Process                      emerging technology, and the geopolitical          \n                               environment. \u00a0 Adapted Board and committee         \n                               meeting structure, process, practices, and         \n                               agendas to enhance our directors\u2019 ability to       \n                               perform their oversight responsibilities by        \n                               providing ample time during Board and committee    \n                               meetings for discussion, debate, in-depth          \n                               reviews, questions, and executive sessions.        \n                               Continued to streamline meeting materials to       \n                               better highlight important information, while      \n                               maintaining completeness, and providing timely     \n                               updates, as needed.

The \nBoard encourages directors to participate annually in external continuing director\neducation programs, and our company reimburses directors for their expenses       \nassociated with this participation. Our directors also attend forums and          \nconferences convened by our primary banking regulators. Continuing director       \neducation is also provided during Board and committee meetings and other          \ndiscussions as part of the formal meetings and as stand-alone information sessions\noutside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2023, our Board heard from our    \nprimary banking regulators, a research academic, a technology company chief       \nexecutive officer, a former leader in the U.S. military, a senior researcher from \na global policy think tank and research institute, outside counsel, and from      \nmanagement on numerous subjects, including generative artificial intelligence and \ncybersecurity, the macroeconomic environment, and the impact of geopolitical      \nconflict to global economies, risk management, climate and sustainable finance,   \nhuman capital management and diversity and inclusion, and many related topics. All\nnew directors also participate in our director orientation program during their   \nfirst six months on our Board. New directors have a series of meetings over time  \nwith management representatives from all of our business and staff areas to review\nand discuss, with increasing detail, information about our company, industry, and \nregulatory framework, as well as compliance training. Based on input from our     \ndirectors, we believe this gradual on-boardingapproach over the first six months  \nof Board service, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee       \nmeetings, provides new directors with a strong foundation in our company\u2019s        \nbusinesses, connects directors with members of management with whom they will     \ninteract and oversee, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in Board\ndeliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and educational    \nopportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on the Board  \nand in committees. CEO and senior management succession planning Our Board        \noversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed\nat least annually; three such planning sessions were held in 2023. Our CEO and our\nChief Human Resources Officer provide our Board with recommendations and          \nevaluations of potential CEO successors, and review their development progress.   \nOur Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our CEO and\nour Chief Human Resources Officer, including the qualifications, experience, and  \ndevelopment priorities for these individuals. Directors engage with potential CEO \nand senior management successors at Board and committee meetings and in less      \nformal settings to allow directors to personally assess candidates. Further, our  \nBoard periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management\u2019s     \nqualifications, tenure, and experience. Our Board also establishes steps to       \naddress emergency CEO planning in extraordinary circumstances. Our emergency CEO  \nsuccession planning is intended to enable our company to respond to unexpected    \nposition vacancies, including those resulting from a major catastrophe, by        \ncontinuing our company\u2019s safe and sound operation and minimizing potential        \ndisruption or loss of continuity to our company\u2019s business and operations. Board  \nmeetings and attendance Directors are expected to attend our annual meetings of   \nshareholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each of our incumbent directors\nand nominees attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of our Board and the \ncommittees on which they served during 2023. In addition, all of the directors    \nserving on our Board at the time of our 2023 annual meeting attended the meeting, \nother than Ms. Hudson, who was unable to attend for health reasons. Our           \nindependent directors regularly meet privately in executive session without our   \nChair and CEO or other members of management present, and held 11 such executive  \nsessions in connection with Board meetings in 2023. Our Lead Independent Director \nleads these Board executive sessions.                                             \n                                                                                  \n       The number of formal Board meetings reflected includes the Board\u2019s         \n  (1)  standalone risk oversight meetings. In addition to the number of formal    \n       meetings reflected, from time to time, the Board also held informational   \n       sessions.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  30    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nCommittees and membership Our Board has four committees. Charters describing the  \nresponsibilities of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee, Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, and Enterprise\nRisk Committee can be found at http://investor.bankofamerica.com, and their       \nmembership is set forth below. Our Board committees regularly make recommendations\nand report on their activities to the entire Board. Each committee may obtain     \nadvice from internal or external financial, legal, accounting, or other advisors  \nat their discretion.

The Board and management review   \nthe Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement for enhancements and improvements  \nat least annually. The Risk Framework serves as the foundation for consistent and \neffective risk management by setting forth clear roles, responsibilities, and     \naccountability for the management of risk and describing how our Board oversees   \nthe establishment of our risk appetite, which indicates the amount of capital,    \nearnings, or liquidity the Board and management believe appropriate to put at risk\nto achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable\nregulatory requirements. This framework of objective, independent Board oversight \nand management\u2019s robust risk management better enables us to serve our clients,   \ndeliver long-term value for our shareholders, achieve our strategic objectives,   \nand make our company a great place to work.                                       \n                         \n  32    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nOur risk governance structure Our directors have relevant risk management         \noversight experience; see \u201cElecting directors\u201d and \u201cOur director nominees\u201d on     \npages 8 and 11.

The Board and the         \nEnterprise Risk Committee, which is responsible for reviewing cybersecurity risk, \neach receive regular presentations, memoranda, and reports throughout the year    \nfrom our Chief Technology and Information Officer and our Chief Information       \nSecurity Officer on internal and external cybersecurity developments, threats and \nrisks. On a quarterly basis, GIS sends the Board a memorandum highlighting        \nrelevant cybersecurity developments and a document detailing the performance      \nmetrics for the GIS Program. Under the Board\u2019s oversight, management works closely\nwith key stakeholders, including regulators, government agencies, law enforcement,\npeer institutions and industry groups, and develops and invests in                \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    33  \n                              \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \ntalent and innovative technology in order to better manage cybersecurity risk.    \nEmployees across the company also play a role in protecting the company from      \ncybersecurity threats and receive periodic training and education on              \ncybersecurity-related topics. More information regarding our company\u2019s risk       \nmanagement policies and practices, including our Board\u2019s oversight of             \ncybersecurity and information security risk, are described under \u201cCompliance and  \nOperational Risk Management\u201d in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and   \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our 2023 Form 10-K. \nWe believe our holistic, ongoing Board and committee risk oversight process       \nprovides for consistent and effective oversight of current and emerging risks     \nfacing our company and demonstrates our commitment to a culture of rigorous risk  \nmanagement and compliance.

The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance;  \n(ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory        \ndevelopments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the      \nCommittee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation    \nstatement, or \u201ctally sheet,\u201d for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect \neach executive officer\u2019s total compensation, including base salary, cash, and     \nequity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards    \n(including the status of achieving any performance goals), qualified and          \nnonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit accruals, and the       \nincremental cost to our company of the executive\u2019s perquisites. The Committee uses\nthis information to evaluate all elements of compensation and benefits provided to\nan executive officer. The Committee also annually reviews market pay practices,   \nincluding compensation benchmarks at our primary competitor group, to evaluate    \nmarket trends and competitive pay levels for our executive officers. For          \nadditional information, see \u201c2023 Competitor group\u201d section on page 72. Annually, \nthe Committee reviews with our Board its compensation decisions (including cash   \nand equity-based incentive awards, if applicable) for executives who report       \ndirectly to our CEO. With respect to the CEO\u2019s compensation, the Committee makes a\nrecommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of\nthe Board. The CEO does not participate in Committee or Board deliberations about \nhis compensation. Additionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit        \nExecutive, the Committee\u2019s pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved  \nby our Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.       \nExecutive officers do not engage with the Committee in setting the amount of their\nown individual compensation. During annual performance reviews for executive      \nofficers other than our CEO, the Committee considers our CEO\u2019s perspective and    \nincentive award recommendations before approving compensation for each of these   \nexecutive officers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our   \nvarious lines of business, business segments, and functions, as well as           \nperformance feedback from our Chief Human Resources Officer and our independent   \ncontrol functions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources,\nand Legal). The Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its     \ncharter to approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for  \nthose services. The Committee retained Farient Advisors LLC (Farient Advisors) as \nits 2023 independent compensation consultant. Farient Advisors\u2019 business with us  \nis limited to providing independent executive and director compensation consulting\nservices. Farient Advisors does not provide any other services to our company. For\n2023, Farient Advisors provided the Committee external market and performance     \ncomparisons, advised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director         \ncompensation, assisted in evaluating program design, and assisted with other      \nexecutive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services,\nFarient Advisors met regularly with the Committee without management and privately\nwith the Chair of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to management certain \nduties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee    \ndelegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation   \nCommittee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO  \nand his direct reports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee      \nsubstantially all of our employee benefit plans.

Consistent with global regulatory initiatives, our Compensation   \nGovernance Policy requires that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage \nexcessive risk-taking.                                                            \n                                                                                  \n                            Our Compensation                                      \n                            Governance Policy                                     \n                            addresses...                                          \n  \u2022 Definition and process                                                        \n  for identifying                                      \u2022\u2002\u2009Policies on incentive   \n  \u201crisk-taking\u201d employees                              compensation plan          \n  \u2022 Key goals and                                      effectiveness through      \n  process for incentive                                testing and monitoring to  \n  compensation plan                                    confirm that the plans     \n  design and governance to                             appropriately balance      \n  appropriately                                        risks with compensation    \n  balance risks with                                   outcomes, including        \n  compensation                                         developing processes to    \n  outcomes, including:                                 administer cancellations   \n  \u2022 funding incentive                                  and clawbacks \u00a0 \u2022\u2002\u2009        \n  compensation pools \u2022                                 Policies that provide for  \n  determining individual                               the independence of our    \n  incentive                                            company\u2019s independent      \n  compensation awards \u2022                                control functions and      \n  use of discretion                                    their appropriate input    \n  as part of those                                     to the Committee           \n  processes                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nCompensation governance structure. Our compensation governance structure allocates\nresponsibility so that our Board, Compensation and Human Capital Committee, or the\nappropriate management-level governing body makes compensation decisions with     \ndocumented input from the independent control functions. This approach promotes   \neffective oversight and review and facilitates the appropriate governance to      \nbalance risk and reward. Below is an illustration of our compensation governance  \nstructure, which is influenced by internal considerations and external factors:   \nIncentive plan certification process. Pursuant to our Compensation Governance     \nPolicy, our annual incentive plan certification and review process provides for a \ncomprehensive review, analysis, and discussion of incentive design and operation. \nAs part of the governance for incentive plans, each of the CEO\u2019s direct reports   \nwho is responsible for an incentive plan, along with their management teams and   \nindependent control functions (including their respective risk officers), meet    \nperiodically to discuss how business strategy, performance, and risk align to     \ncompensation. The relevant participants certify that the incentive programs they  \nreview: (i) are aligned with the applicable lines of business and our company\u2019s   \nbusiness strategy and performance objectives; (ii) do not encourage excessive or  \nimprudent risk-taking beyond our company\u2019s ability to effectively identify and    \nmanage risk; (iii) are compatible with effective controls and risk management; and\n(iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary trading. Our Chief Risk Officer \nalso certifies all incentive plans across our company as part of the Management   \nCompensation Committee\u2019s governance process. Farient Advisors and the Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee review these management certifications. Incentive plan\naudit reviews. Corporate Audit annually reviews the operational effectiveness of  \nthe incentive compensation program, using a risk-based approach to evaluate plan  \ndesign, pay execution, program governance, and conformity with regulatory         \nrequirements. Conduct reviews. As part of our compensation governance practices,  \nmanagement reviews the results of the conduct review process so that conduct is   \nconsistently and appropriately considered in performance assessments and pay      \ndecisions across the company. These performance and pay outcomes are reviewed at  \nleast annually by the Committee.                                                  \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    35  \n                              \n                        \n  Corporate\u00a0governance  \n                        \nIndependent control function feedback. In addition to reviewing the individual    \nincentive compensation awards for executive officers and other senior executives  \nwho report directly to the CEO, the Committee also reviews the outcomes of our    \ncontrol function feedback process and individual incentive compensation awards for\ncertain highly compensated employees. As part of its governance process, the      \nCommittee meets with the heads of our independent control functions and business  \nlines to discuss their feedback on the pay-for-performanceprocess, including how  \nrisk management and conduct matters were factored into compensation decisions.    \nThese processes and reviews, in combination with risk management and clawback     \nfeatures, are key components of our compensation programs. These programs are     \ndesigned to appropriately hold employees accountable, while balancing risks and   \nrewards in a way that does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking or    \ncreate risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our  \ncompany. Hedging policy. Under our Code of Conduct and other policies, all Bank of\nAmerica directors, executive officers, and certain other designated insiders are  \nprohibited from hedging, speculative trading, or trading in derivative securities \nwith respect to Bank of America securities. They may not engage in short sales and\ntrading in puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars,\nor exchange funds, and other options or derivatives with respect to our           \nsecurities. All other employees may not engage in any such transactions other than\ntransactions that hedge against an existing long position in our securities if the\nshares underlying the position are readily available for sale or delivery. No     \nemployee may hedge the value of outstanding restricted stock units or other       \nequity-based awards, and such awards may be forfeited or recouped for violation of\nour anti-hedging and derivative transactions policies.

in which we work   \nand live. We do this in numerous ways. We help provide economic opportunities for \npeople and communities through access to lending and capital for homeowners,      \nbusiness owners, and entrepreneurs. Through our philanthropic partnerships, we    \nfocus on improving the lives of individuals and families by investing in basic    \nneeds, such as healthcare and hunger relief, workforce development, and education,\nwhile also strengthening broader community vitality by addressing needs related to\naffordable housing, small businesses, and neighborhood revitalization. As a       \ncompany with national and global operations, our Board and management understand  \nthe need for real and ongoing progress on assessing and addressing diversity and  \ninclusion and economic inequality in the U.S. Our long-standing commitment to     \npromote equality, diversity and inclusion, and advance economic mobility includes \nmultiple strategies from across our company. Through all of our activities, we    \ndrive positive change within and outside our company. We enlist many independent  \nthird parties, including our National Community Advisory Council, for advice,     \ncounsel, perspective, ideas, and assistance. These third parties and other        \nstakeholders represent a range of diverse perspectives and provide continuous     \nfeedback on our actions and progress, holding us accountable. Our Board and its   \nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee and Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee provide governance and oversight of these efforts. We are       \ntransparent and report on our activities, seeking input from our shareholders     \nabout the type of information that would be useful to them in assessing our       \nactivities, review that input with our Board and its committees, and provide      \nadditional disclosures in response so that we are accountable for our progress.   \nOur commitment and how we share success with our communities is dynamic and       \nmultifaceted. Read about it in more detail in our 2023 Annual Report. Driving     \nprogress through our focus on a more sustainable future Consistent with our drive \nfor Responsible Growth, we continue to make progress on our strategy to support   \nand finance the transition to a low-carboneconomy. This includes setting and      \ndisclosing milestone targets, engaging with clients to support their transition,  \ninvesting in climate solutions, developing and reporting decision-useful metrics  \nto drive progress, leading industry collaborations, and following guidance for    \ntransparency. We strive to be transparent and accountable, reporting on our       \nclimate goals and progress, including in our 2023 TCFD Report and our             \nEnvironmental and Social Risk Policy Framework. Our enterprise climate strategy   \nand Approach to Zero.Our three-pronged climate strategy is part of our overall    \nfocus on Responsible Growth and centers on engagement and partnership with        \ninternal and external parties.

A key aspect of our Approach to Zero          \n  includes extensive engagement with our clients      \n  across all eight lines of business. We have:        \n  \u2022 developed net zero awareness training for our     \n  banking, credit, and risk teammates to increase     \n  their knowledge and understanding to support        \n  clients in reaching net zero; \u2022 created an online   \n  Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability  \n  college available to all teammates to deepen their  \n  understanding of these topics. Our aim is to help   \n  clients understand the primary decarbonization      \n  strategies for individual sectors and the           \n  traditional and new financing solutions we offer    \n  in their transition; and \u2022 multiple teams across    \n  our company are working to execute against our net  \n  zero goal, mobilize intellectual and financial      \n  capital to assist clients in their transition, and  \n  assess and manage both climate-related risks and    \n  opportunities.                                      \n                                                      \nWe believe there is a tremendous business opportunity in assisting our clients    \nwith their commitment to net zero and are developing innovative products and      \nservices to do so. We are also financing emerging technologies that we believe    \nwill be critical to achieving net zero by 2050, such as bioenergy, including      \nsustainable aviation fuel, electric vehicle infrastructure, carbon sequestering   \nand removal, and sustainable agriculture. Climate-related risk management We use  \nrisk identification, measurement, and monitoring tools to drive policies,         \nprocesses, and testing efforts to manage and mitigate exposure to climate-related \nrisk. We have incorporated climate considerations into our Risk Framework and Risk\nAppetite Statement. We conduct enhanced due diligence and take additional measures\nto identify, evaluate, and mitigate environmental and social risks for certain    \nclients, business activities, industries, sectors, and geographies through a      \nclient- and deal-specific process that considers portfolio-level credit,          \noperational, reputational, and other risks, including climate risk. More details  \non our approach to addressing the clean energy transition and managing risk in our\nfinancing activities can be found in our 2023 TCFD Report, our Environmental and  \nSocial Risk Policy Framework, our 2023 Annual Report, which accompanies this proxy\nstatement, and in our Board\u2019s response to Proposals 6 and 7 starting on page 100. \nBeing a great place to work Central to Responsible Growth is being a great place  \nto work for our teammates. We deliver on this commitment by fostering a diverse   \nand inclusive workplace so our workforce reflects the communities we serve,       \nattracting and developing exceptional talent, expanding our benefits and resources\nto support the physical, emotional, and financial wellness of our teammates and   \ntheir families, recognizing and rewarding performance, and providing a competitive\nstarting wage. To promote transparency, accountability, and continued progress, we\nhold ourselves accountable each year by using third parties to validate equal pay \nfor equal work and by asking our workforce to tell us how we are doing in our     \nEmployee Satisfaction Survey, which includes a diversity and inclusion component. \nOur focus on being a great place to work is highlighted in the Human Capital      \nManagement update in our 2023 Annual Report, which accompanies this proxy         \nstatement. Building a diverse and inclusive workplace that mirrors the clients &  \ncommunities we serve We believe that our diversity makes us stronger, and our     \nleaders embrace diversity and inclusion as integral to our business success. Our  \ncommitment starts at the top with oversight from our Board and CEO and extends to \nall teammates. Each management team member has aspirational diversity goals that  \nare specific to the business, subject to our quarterly business review process,   \nused as part of talent planning, and included in scorecards reviewed by the Board.\nManagement team members cascade these aspirational goals across their             \norganizations to support engagement and accountability across the company. We hold\nall managers responsible for driving an inclusive work environment and a diverse  \nworkforce that mirrors the clients and communities we serve. We also provide      \nopportunities for managers to sponsor and support rising talent to continue       \nbuilding our workforce. Our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council was established  \nmore than 20 years ago and continues to promote aspirational diversity goal       \nsetting, which is embedded in our performance management process at all levels of \nthe organization. The global council sponsors and supports business, operating    \nunit, and regional diversity and inclusion councils to provide alignment to       \nenterprise diversity and inclusion strategies and aspirational                    \n                         \n  42    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                  \n  Responsible\u00a0Growth:\u00a0Growth\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0Sustainable  \n                                                  \ngoals. Membership on the council consists of senior executives from every line of \nbusiness, every region, and our local markets, and the council has been chaired by\nMr. Moynihan since 2007. Our Chief Diversity & Inclusion and Corporate Social     \nResponsibility Officer partners with our CEO and management team to drive our     \ndiversity and inclusion strategy, initiatives, programs, and policies.            \nTransparency and accountability.We hold ourselves accountable for increasing      \ndiverse representation, including by disclosing our employment metrics and        \nmeasuring progress across top management levels. We have built robust analytics   \nand put processes in place at all levels of the company, including our top three  \nmanagement levels, to drive progress and accountability. And we report on our     \nprogress by including a Human Capital Management update section in our Annual     \nReport to provide key information on our progress in being a great place to work, \nas well as by routinely disclosing our company\u2019s EEO diversity statistics.        \nRecruiting and developing talented teammates A key aspect of Responsible Growth is\nattracting and retaining exceptional talent from around the world to our company. \nThis starts with how we recruit new employees and extends to the many ways we     \nsupport their professional development and career growth. We have built a diverse \npipeline of candidates for positions at all levels of the company, including      \nleadership positions, as demonstrated in our published workforce diversity        \nmetrics. In addition to our rigorous candidate review policy, our longstanding    \npractice of using diverse slates to grow diversity at senior levels of the        \ncompany\u2014which was formalized into a policy\u2014has helped to drive strong progress    \ntoward our aspirational goal for our workforce to mirror the clients and          \ncommunities we serve at all levels of the company.

In 2023 we also provided more than $68 \nmillion to workforce development organizations that are providing critical skills-\ntraining, work experience, and support to help individuals from low- and moderate-\nincome communities obtain and succeed in family-sustaining jobs. We have now      \nsurpassed our aspirational goal of attracting and hiring 20,000 teammates from    \nlow- and moderate- income communities. We work with more than 90 external         \npartners, including nonprofit organizations, to identify talent and expand our    \nimpact.

We believe our pay-for-performance     \napproach\u2014combined with our focus on workforce representation\u2014will continue driving\nthe advancement and representation of women and people of color in our company. We\nare committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain robust policies and        \npractices that reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews with         \noversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 17 years, we have conducted \nrigorous processes and analyses with outside experts to examine individual        \nemployee pay before year-endcompensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust   \ncompensation where appropriate. In 2023, our review of equal pay for equal work   \ndemonstrated that we continue to compensate our employees fairly and equitably.   \nResults of this review showed that compensation received by women globally, was on\naverage more than 99% of that received by men in comparable positions. In the     \nU.S., compensation received by people of color was on average more than 99% of    \nthat received by non-people of color employees. Equal pay for equal work          \ncommitments We strive to pay our employees fairly based on market rates for their \nroles, experience, and individual performance, and we regularly benchmark against \nother companies both within and outside our industry to help confirm our pay is   \ncompetitive. We have a standard U.S. practice that restricts the solicitation of  \ncompensation information from candidates during our hiring process to ensure we   \nconsider new hires based on their individual qualifications and experiences,      \nrather than how they may have been previously compensated.                        \n                         \n  44    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                  \n  Responsible\u00a0Growth:\u00a0Growth\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0Sustainable  \n                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                 Sharing Success  \n  $25 by 2025                                                    compensation     \n                                                                 awards(1)        \n                                                                 For the seventh  \n                                                                 year since       \n                               We have                           2017, we         \n                               consistently                      recognized our   \n                               been an                           teammates with   \n                               industry                          Sharing Success  \n                               leader in                         compensation     \n                               establishing                      awards.          \n                               an internal                       Approximately    \n                               minimum rate                      97% of           \n                               of pay above                      employees        \n                               all mandated                      globally have    \n                               minimums for                      received or      \n                               our U.S.                          will receive an  \n                               hourly                            award this       \n                               employees.

Our Diversity &       \nInclusion Index, (1)which measures input from our teammates on inclusion at our   \ncompany, was up 8% over the same period. The results of the survey and the process\nof continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least        \nannually. Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great place to work. We     \nbelieve our employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement    \nresults and how our teammates view Bank of America as an employer of choice. In   \nthat time, we have experienced vastly different labor markets, the pandemic, and  \nreturn to office. Our turnover among teammates was 8% in 2023, the lowest on      \nrecord other than the pandemic year of 2020. We are investing in teammates\u2019 career\ngrowth and success. With our variety of resources and programs that support career\ngrowth and development, we are helping teammates have long-term careers with our  \ncompany. We also continue to enhance our internal mobility practices and, in 2023,\nmore than 5,000 teammates found new roles within our company and we delivered more\nthan 6.7 million hours of training and development to our teammates through The   \nAcademy at Bank of America, our award-winning onboarding, education, and          \nprofessional development organization. 2023 Employee Engagement Survey and        \nturnover results                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Diversity\u00a0& Inclusion Index measures core areas like how comfortable   \n       teammates feel sharing different opinions without fear of negative         \n       consequences, whether or not they feel they are being treated fairly,      \n  (1)  their impression of how well Bank of America has done in creating an       \n       environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed and how Bank   \n       of America values the unique experiences our teammates bring to the        \n       workplace.

Our policy covers any transactions where the aggregate      \namount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our\ncompany is a participant, and a related person has or will have a direct or       \nindirect material interest. Under our related person transactions policy, our     \nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee must approve or ratify any\nrelated person transactions, and when doing so, consider: the related person\u2019s    \ninterest in the transaction; whether the transaction involves arm\u2019s-lengthbids or \nmarket prices and terms; the transaction\u2019s materiality to each party; the         \navailability of the product or services through other sources; the implications of\nour Code of Conduct or reputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a  \ndirector\u2019s or executive officer\u2019s judgment to act in our company\u2019s best interest; \nthe transaction\u2019s acceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an          \nindependent director, whether the transaction would impair his or her independence\nor status as an \u201coutside\u201d or \u201cnon-employee\u201ddirector. Our Board has determined that\ncertain types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect       \nmaterial interest on the part of the related person and therefore do not require  \nreview or approval under the policy. These include transactions involving         \nfinancial services, including: loans and brokerage; banking, insurance, investment\nadvisory, or asset management services; and other financial services we provide to\nany related person, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of        \nbusiness, on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for     \ncomparable services provided to non-affiliates,and comply with applicable law,    \nincluding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. A\nnumber of our directors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family  \nmembers, and certain business organizations associated with them are or have been \nclients of our banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons    \nhave been made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in       \ncomparable transactions with persons not related to our company and did not       \ninvolve more than the normal risk of collectability. Occasionally, we may have    \nemployees who are Immediate Family Members of our executive officers, directors,  \nor director nominees. The son of Mr. D. Steve Boland, an executive officer, and   \nthe brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee, are each employed by the company\nin non-executive, non-strategicpositions, and each received compensation in 2023  \nof approximately $185,000 and $470,000, respectively. Dr. Zuber\u2019s brother\u2019s       \ncompensation is primarily commissions based. The methodology through which his    \ncompensation is calculated is consistent with that used for other financial       \nadvisors in similar roles. The compensation and other terms of employment of both \nMr. Boland\u2019s son and Dr. Zuber\u2019s brother are determined on a basis consistent with\nthe company\u2019s human resources policies. Our company and Mr. Moynihan are parties  \nto an aircraft time-sharing agreement, as disclosed in prior proxy statements and \napproved by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee in        \nDecember 2010. In addition, the company and each of our executive officers have   \nentered into nonexclusive aircraft time-sharing agreements. These agreements      \nprovide a means under Federal Aviation Administration regulations for our         \nexecutive officers to reimburse the company for incremental costs of permitted    \npersonal travel on our company\u2019s aircraft. To the extent such aircraft usage      \nexceeds the dollar threshold in our related person transactions policy, it will be\nreviewed for approval or ratification by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and       \nSustainability Committee. Based on information contained in separate Schedule 13G \nfilings with the SEC, each of Warren E. Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire\nHathaway), BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), and The Vanguard Group (Vanguard) reported\nthat it beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common   \nstock as of December 31, 2023 (see \u201cStock ownership of directors, executive       \nofficers, and certain beneficial owners\u201d on the next page). In the ordinary course\nof our business during 2023, our subsidiaries provided and are expected to        \ncontinue to provide financial advisory, sales and trading, treasury, and other    \nfinancial or administrative services to Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, and        \nVanguard and their subsidiaries. These and other routine business transactions    \nbetween the companies were entered into on an arm\u2019s-lengthbasis and contain       \ncustomary terms and conditions. Our company and its subsidiaries may also, in the \nordinary course, invest in BlackRock or Vanguard funds or other products or buy or\nsell assets to or from BlackRock or Vanguard funds and separate accounts.         \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    47  \n                              \n                                                     \n  Stock ownership of directors, executive officers,  \n  and certain beneficial owners                      \n                                                     \nStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners   \nThe following table shows the number of shares of our common stock beneficially   \nowned as of March 1, 2024 by: (i) each director; (ii) each named executive        \nofficer; (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group; and (iv)          \nbeneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities (as       \ndetermined under SEC rules).

The number of restricted shares awarded is equal \nto the dollar value of the award divided by the closing price of our common stock \non the NYSE on the grant date, rounded down to the next whole share, with cash    \npaid for any fractional share. The annual restricted stock award is subject to a  \none-yearvesting requirement. If a director retires before the one-yearvesting     \ndate, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the        \ndirector served during the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested amount  \nof the award is forfeited. Following the BACEP\u2019s amendment and restatement,       \neffective April 25, 2023, dividends accrue during the one-yearvesting period and  \nare paid when the award vests. Prior to April 25, 2023, dividends were paid on the\naward when they were paid on shares of our common stock. Director compensation    \nreview Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee annually reviews and          \nperiodically recommends updates to the director compensation program to our Board \nfor approval. The Committee\u2019s recommendation takes into account our director      \ncompensation philosophy, changes in market practices, and consultation with the   \nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation consultant, Farient Advisors. As disclosed in\nour 2023 proxy statement, following the Committee\u2019s 2022 review, our Board        \napproved: for all non-managementdirectors, a $20,000 annual cash award increase to\n$120,000 and a $20,000 annual restricted stock award increase to $270,000; for our\nLead Independent Director, a $25,000 incremental annual cash award increase to    \n$75,000 and a $25,000 incremental annual restricted stock award increase to       \n$125,000. These changes took effect as of our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders \nand are reflected in the table above. No changes were made to the form or amount  \nof director compensation as part of the 2023 review. Director deferral plan Non-  \nmanagementdirectors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual restricted\nstock or cash awards through the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral    \nPlan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors elect to defer their restricted     \nstock award, their stock account is credited with stock units equal in value to   \nthe restricted stock award and subject to the same vesting requirement applicable \nto restricted stock awards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a   \nshare of our common stock but because it is not an actual share of our common     \nstock, it does not have any voting rights. When directors elect to defer their    \ncash award, they may choose to defer into either a stock account or a cash        \naccount.

The exchange rate used for  \n  each payment was based on the average exchange      \n  rate for the month prior to the month of payment.   \n  In addition, Mr. Woods was appointed as a member    \n  of the board of directors of BofASE, effective      \n  January 29, 2024. For his services as a member of   \n  the board of directors of BofASE, Mr. Woods will    \n  receive an annual cash retainer totaling \u20ac90,000,   \n  prorated for commencement of services beginning     \n  January 29, 2024. This 2024 retainer is not         \n  reflected in the table above.                       \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  MLI and BofASE are both subject to extensive        \n  foreign regulatory requirements. In light of the    \n  regulated status of these subsidiaries and Mr. de   \n  Weck\u2019s and Mr. Woods\u2019 responsibilities on these     \n  boards of directors for these entities, we believe  \n  the annual cash retainers paid to Mr. de Weck and   \n  Mr. Woods are commensurate with their roles and     \n  responsibilities.                                   \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  This column excludes the perquisites received by a  \n  director to the extent the total value of such      \n  perquisites was less than $10,000 in aggregate, as  \n  permitted under SEC rules.                          \n                                                      \n                         \n  52    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                      \n  Proposal\u00a02:                                         \n  Approving our executive compensation (an advisory,  \n  non-binding \u201cSay on Pay\u201d resolution)                \n                                                      \nProposal 2: Approving our executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding \u201cSay on\nPay\u201d resolution) We are seeking an advisory vote to approve our executive         \ncompensation for 2023. At our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, our            \nshareholders voted to have a \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote each year. As a result, we will    \nconduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually at least until the    \nnext shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. Although the \u201cSay  \non Pay\u201d vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, our Compensation and    \nHuman Capital Committee will take into consideration the outcome of the vote when \nmaking future executive compensation decisions. At the 2023 annual meeting of     \nshareholders, 69.1% of the votes cast favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. The      \nCommittee considered this result along with input from shareholders during a      \nrobust shareholder engagement process in 2023 to inform enhancements to our       \nexecutive compensation program and disclosures. Our Board has designed our current\nexecutive compensation program to appropriately link compensation realized by our \nexecutive officers to our performance and properly align the interests of our     \nexecutive officers with those of our shareholders. The details of this            \ncompensation for 2023, and the reasons we awarded it, are described in            \n\u201cCompensation discussion and analysis,\u201d starting below.                           \n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d approving our   \n  executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding  \n  \u201cSay on Pay\u201d resolution) (Proposal 2).            \n                                                    \nOur Board recommends that our shareholders vote in favor of the following         \nresolution: \u201cResolved, that our shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the   \ncompensation of our company\u2019s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to  \nthe compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \nincluding the Compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables, and  \nthe accompanying narrative discussion disclosed in this proxy statement.\u201d         \nCompensation discussion and analysis                                              \n                                                            \n  1.\u2003Executive summary                                  54  \n  a.\u2003Shareholder engagement & \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results      54  \n  b.\u2003What we heard and how we responded                 55  \n  c.\u2003Executive compensation philosophy                  56  \n  d.\u2003Philosophy on one-time awards                      56  \n  e.\u20032023 Executive compensation highlights             57  \n  2.\u2003Performance evaluation and pay decision process    58  \n  3.\u20032023 Company, segment, & individual performance    60  \n  a.\u2003Company performance                                60  \n  b.\u2003Segment performance                                61  \n  c.

Executive summary a. Shareholder engagement & \u201cSay on Pay\u201d results We have a   \nlong history of strong shareholder support for our Board\u2019s pay-for-performance    \nphilosophy, as accomplished through our executive compensation design and         \ndecisions. From 2011 to 2022, support for our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal averaged      \n94.2%, with the lowest level of support being 92.9% in 2011 and 2012. In          \nrecognition of this continued support as well as input from engagement with       \ninstitutional shareholders, for 2022, our Board maintained a consistent executive \ncompensation design and in applying its pay-for-performance philosophy, decreased \nthe overall pay to Mr. Moynihan by approximately 6%. Compensation for that year\u2019s \nother named executive officers also decreased between approximately 5% and 7%     \nbased on 2022 performance. Leading up to our 2023 annual meeting, two U.S. proxy  \nadvisory firms recommended\u2014for the first time ever\u2014that their subscribers vote    \n\u201cagainst\u201d our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. We believe these recommendations contributed \nsignificantly to the lower support received in 2023, as some of our institutional \ninvestors follow the voting recommendations of these firms and some others are    \ninfluenced by their analyses and recommendations. In total, of the approximately  \n5.7 billion votes cast at the meeting, 69.1% favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In\nlight of the result of our 2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote, which differed significantly   \nfrom our prior history, and in order to ascertain the reasons for the decline, we \nintentionally refocused our 2023 and early 2024 shareholder engagements more      \ndirectly on our executive compensation program and disclosures than in prior      \nyears. Executive Compensation Engagements We value the views and input of our     \nshareholders. Input received from our shareholder engagement is critical to how we\ndrive progress in our corporate governance practices, including our executive     \ncompensation program. Generally, we engage with our investors year-round through  \ntargeted, active outreach and responsiveness to inbound inquiries. We targeted our\n2023 and early 2024 outreach efforts and actively solicited input from            \nshareholders on our executive compensation program and disclosures. We            \nspecifically solicited input on our executive compensation program as part of our \nengagement agenda, welcoming dialogue with those who supported and those who did  \nnot support our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal last year. During 2023, into early 2024 we  \nreached out to 84 institutional shareholders, representing approximately 79% of   \ninstitutionally held shares, (1)and held a total of 72 meetings with 46           \nshareholders. We also solicited input from the two U.S. proxy advisory firms and  \nheld multiple meetings with each over this period. Our Lead Independent Director, \nMr. Nowell, and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee Chair, Ms. Lozano,   \nplayed a central role in these discussions. Mr. Nowell and Ms. Lozano actively led\n41 of our shareholder engagement meetings as well as two of the meetings with the \nU.S. proxy advisory firms. Overall, investors expressed their understanding and   \nsupport for our compensation program and structure and its alignment with the     \ntenets of Responsible Growth. We focused on listening to shareholders to          \nunderstand why they had voted against \u201cSay on Pay\u201d last year, and to confirm their\nexpectations of an appropriate response to regain support. We received specific   \ninput on two key areas that contributed to a lower \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote result in    \n2023: 1) one-time awards and 2) transparency in the pay decision process. This    \ninput, along with a range of perspectives and suggestions received during our     \nshareholder engagement, informed the Committee\u2019s decision to implement            \nenhancements to our 2023 compensation program and disclosures.

We did receive specific input on two key    \n  areas that contributed to a lower \u201cSay on Pay\u201d      \n  vote result in 2023:                                \n  1) one-time awards and 2) transparency in the pay   \n  decision process. The Committee implemented         \n  enhancements to address these areas, as summarized  \n  below.                                              \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  WHAT WE HEARD                            HOW WE RESPONDED                       \n                                           \u2022\u2002\u2009The Committee declared its          \n                                           philosophy on the use of one-time      \n                                           awards, including only to be used      \n                                           infrequently and in exceptional        \n                                           circumstances to achieve business      \n  Belief that one-time awards should be    objectives beyond what could be        \n  infrequent, and when used, have a        achieved through annual performance    \n  clear                                    year compensation.

Executive compensation philosophy Our compensation philosophy is to pay for    \nperformance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance    \nconsiderations include both financial and non-financial measures\u2014including the    \nmanner in which results are achieved\u2014for the company, line of business, and the   \nindividual. The \u201cPerformance evaluation and pay decision process\u201d section on page \n58 presents the range of performance and governance considerations that the       \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee considers as inputs into compensation    \ndecisions. These factors are evaluated each year and have remained generally      \nconsistent over time as part of a balanced and disciplined approach to the        \ncompensation decision process. Within that broader framework, the \u201cCompany        \nperformance\u201d and \u201cSegment performance\u201d sections on pages 60 and 61 highlight key  \ncompany and segment performance considerations for 2023, and the \u201cIndividual      \nperformance and pay rationale highlights\u201d section beginning on page 62 focuses on \nperformance for each of our named executive officers. These considerations        \nreinforce and promote Responsible Growth and maintain alignment with our Risk     \nFramework. Our executive compensation program provides a mix of salary,           \nincentives, and benefits paid over time to align executive officer and shareholder\ninterests. Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee has the primary           \nresponsibility for approving our compensation strategy and philosophy, and the    \ncompensation programs applicable to our named executive officers listed below.    \nWith respect to Mr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation, our Compensation and Human Capital   \nCommittee makes a recommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the     \nindependent members of the Board. d. Philosophy on one-timeawards                 \n                                                      \n  The Compensation and Human Capital Committee        \n  believes that one-time awards should be used        \n  infrequently and in exceptional circumstances to    \n  achieve business objectives beyond that which       \n  could be achieved through annual performance year   \n  compensation. The Committee has demonstrated its    \n  belief in this philosophy through a history of      \n  limiting the grant of one-time awards to executive  \n  officers, with the one-time awards granted in 2022  \n  and 2023 being the first since Mr. Moynihan became  \n  CEO in 2010. Mr. Moynihan, as CEO, has never        \n  received a one-time award. Based on input received  \n  from our shareholders following the \u201cSay on Pay\u201d    \n  vote in April 2023, the Committee will continue to  \n  limit the use of one-time awards to exceptional     \n  circumstances and disclose a clear rationale for    \n  any such award in the Compensation Discussion and   \n  Analysis when granted to named executive officers.  \n  Additionally, the Committee follows an approach     \n  aligned with the following principles:              \n  \u2022 One-time awards may be appropriate in             \n  exceptional circumstances to retain key             \n  executives, to drive stability in the               \n  organization, or in other unique circumstances. \u2022   \n  Future one-time awards should include performance   \n  features, in the event that one-time awards are     \n  deemed appropriate. \u2022 The use of one-time awards    \n  allows the application of award provisions aligned  \n  with business objectives that may be different      \n  than annual performance year awards (e.g.,          \n  back-loaded, retentive vesting schedule). \u2022         \n  Granting one-time awards as separate and distinct   \n  from annual compensation helps to reinforce that    \n  these awards should not be expected in subsequent   \n  years. \u2022 One-time awards will not be granted to     \n  offset reduced performance year incentives or       \n  missed performance standards.                       \n                                                      \n                         \n  56    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \ne. 2023 Executive compensation highlights Named executive officers                \n                                                                             \n  Brian T.

Performance evaluation and pay decision process Each year, our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee undertakes a structured and disciplined approach to       \nevaluate our named executive officers\u2019 performance and determine compensation. I. \nPerformance Metrics and Scorecards At the start of each year, goals aligned to the\ntenets of Responsible Growth are set for each executive officer and progress to   \nmeeting those goals is tracked on scorecards. Individual scorecards are tailored  \nto each named executive officer and include enterprise-wide and line of business  \nmetrics. These scorecards and additional performance information are reviewed by  \nthe Board over the course of the year and evaluated at the conclusion of each     \nperformance year. In addition to evaluation of the scorecards, the Committee\u2019s    \ncompensation decision process includes a robust review of company and line of     \nbusiness performance as well as individual performance for each named executive   \nofficer. The Committee considers both absolute and relative metrics when          \nevaluating performance, including relative rankings for company performance       \nagainst our peers and market share for relevant business segments. For relative   \nmetrics considered in 2023, see the \u201c2023 Company, segment, & individual          \nperformance\u201d section on page 60. Our performance framework for named executive    \nofficers is aligned to qualitative and quantitative metrics associated with the   \nfour tenets of Responsible Growth.

Evaluation and Pay Decisions Evaluation and pay decisions begin with a robust\nand detailed review of performance results aligned with the four tenets of        \nResponsible Growth. The evaluation considers the \u201cWhat,\u201d which includes an        \nevaluation of performance against scorecard metrics, and the \u201cHow\u201d which includes \nthe manner in which results, both financial and non-financial, were achieved.     \nMetrics are reviewed on an absolute basis against the scorecard and key metrics   \nare also reviewed on a relative basis against primary competitors. This metric-   \ndriven evaluation drives the preliminary pay discussion. After the Committee has  \ncompleted its robust and metric-driven performance evaluation to determine        \npreliminary pay, the Committee weighs additional considerations such as market and\ngovernance practices, scope of role, experience, and prior year compensation to   \nhelp inform the final total compensation determination. The Committee believes its\nuse of business judgment and discretion, structured within the framework and      \ngovernance of the tenets of Responsible Growth, is in the best interests of our   \nshareholders, customers and clients, employees, and the communities we serve. This\nenables the Committee to appropriately respond to the complexities of internal and\nexternal factors when determining performance year compensation, including the    \ncomplexity of operating a business the size of Bank of America and the regulatory \nframework in which the company operates. Compensation decisions are generally     \ndetermined on a year-over-year basis without preset target levels of total        \ncompensation. Once performance year total compensation is determined for each     \nnamed executive officer, the Committee applies the variable pay mix, which        \nincludes a majority of pay to be delivered over the long-term and subject to risk \nmanagement features. See \u201cExecutive compensation program features\u201d and            \n\u201cCompensation risk management features\u201d on pages 67 and 69. The Committee\u2019s       \nperformance year total compensation recommendations are then subject to a multi-  \nstep review and approval process outlined below. IV. Approval During the final    \nstage of the pay decision process, the Committee engages in a multi-step review   \nand approval process involving our independent Board members and other Board      \ncommittees.                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The Committee approves compensation for all named executive officers,      \n       excluding the CEO.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       For our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the Committee\u2019s pay  \n  \u2022    recommendations are further reviewed and approved by our Board\u2019s           \n       Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    For the CEO, the Committee\u2019s pay recommendations are further reviewed and  \n       approved by the independent members of our Board.                          \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    59  \n                              \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \n3. 2023 Company, segment, & individual performance a.

Our Compensation and Human Capital         \nCommittee and Board considered these metrics in evaluating the 2023 performance of\nour named executive officers. We delivered strong earnings in 2023 by maintaining \nour focus on Responsible Growth aided by our diverse operating model and risk     \nmanagement focus during a challenging economic environment. See the \u201cPerformance  \nevaluation and pay decision process\u201d section on page 58 for more details on       \nfactors used in compensation decisions.                                           \n                                                      \n  \u2022 Net income of $26.5 billion, or $3.08 diluted     \n  earnings per share (EPS), compared to $27.5         \n  billion or $3.19 diluted EPS in 2022; down          \n  primarily due to higher noninterest expense and     \n  provision for credit losses, partially offset by    \n  higher net interest income. Results included an     \n  industry-wide Federal Deposit Insurance             \n  Corporation (FDIC) special assessment of $2.1       \n  billion (pretax) for Bank of America and a charge   \n  related to the future cessation of the Bloomberg    \n  Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) of $1.6 billion  \n  (pretax), totaling $0.20 and $0.15 per diluted      \n  share, respectively.

Standards for performance restricted stock units Re-earningthe PRSUs granted in\nFebruary 2024 (based on 2023 performance) requires the company to meet average ROA\nand average adjusted TBV growth standards (tax-normalized)over a three-year       \nperformance period from 2024-2026. The Committee made no change to the standards  \nfor performance year 2023 PRSU awards. Under a hypothetical scenario, if our 2023 \nending assets of $3.2 trillion remained constant during the performance period,   \nour company would need to earn $77.1 billion in aggregate net income from         \n2024-2026 to achieve the PRSU 80 bps ROA standard. On an annualized basis, this   \nequals approximately $25.7 billion in earnings which is higher than reported net  \nincome in seven of the last twelve years. These performance metrics and standards \nencourage the achievement of sustained shareholder value and Responsible Growth.  \nPRSUs are forfeited if results are below both minimum standards. PRSUs granted    \nsince 2017 provide no upside payout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be  \nre-earnedfor these awards). For any portion of the PRSU standards achieved,       \npayment will be made after the end of the performance period.

Compensation risk management features Our Compensation and Human Capital       \nCommittee has designed our executive compensation program to encourage executive  \nperformance consistent with the highest standards of risk management. i. Pay      \npractices Highlighted below are the key features of our compensation program for  \nexecutive officers, including the pay practices we have implemented to drive      \nResponsible Growth, encourage executive retention, promote conduct consistent with\nour values, and align executive and shareholder interests. We also identify       \ncertain pay practices we have not implemented because we believe they do not serve\nour risk management standards or shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.               \n

Full-value shares and units owned, awarded, \nor deemed beneficially owned are included in the stock ownership calculations;    \nPRSUs are included only when earned and stock options are not included. All named \nexecutive officers are in compliance with their ownership requirements. Our Code  \nof Conduct prohibits our executive officers from hedging and speculative trading  \nof company securities. See the \u201cHedging policy\u201d section on page 36 for more       \ninformation on our hedging policy and rules. 6. Other compensation topics a.      \nResults for performance restricted stock units PRSUs have been a component of our \nexecutive compensation program since 2011. PRSUs require recipients to re-        \nearnawards over the performance period based on achievement of established        \nperformance standards and help align management with shareholder interests. Since \n2013, PRSUs have been based 50% on three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year   \naverage growth in adjusted TBV standards. Our practice is not to make             \ndiscretionary adjustments to PRSU results for the impact of legacy litigation,    \nfines, and penalties, or impairment charges, which have contributed to outcomes   \nfor PRSU payouts since their introduction. The 2021 PRSUs completed in 2023 were  \nre-earnedat 100% of the target opportunity based on ROA results of 92 bps and     \nadjusted TBV results of 11.09% (compared to 100% target opportunity based on 2021 \nPRSU performance standards set at ROA results of \u226580 bps and TBV results of \u22658.5%)\n(1). We did not adjust the calculation of these performance metrics to reflect the\nFDIC special assessment and BSBY cessation charges in fourth quarter 2023. See the\ndescription of the 2021 PRSUs and vesting terms following the \u201cGrants of plan-    \nbased awards table\u201d on page 74 of our 2022 proxy statement. The maximum payout    \nopportunity is 100% for all outstanding awards. The award terms for these PRSUs   \nprovide for the calculation of performance results at the conclusion of each      \ncalendar year in the performance period. As a result, the performance results     \nabove may differ from the results reported under GAAP in our company\u2019s audited    \nfinancial statements.                                                             \n                                                                                  \n  (1)  The three-year average ROA and three-year average growth in adjusted TBV   \n       results for the 2021 PRSUs were calculated as follows:                     \n                                                                                  \nThree-year Average ROA was the average \u201creturn on assets\u201d for the three calendar  \nyears in the performance period. For this purpose, \u201creturn on assets\u201d was         \ndetermined at the conclusion of the year based on the generally accepted          \naccounting principles (GAAP) at the conclusion of each year definition and, to the\nextent necessary, normalized to exclude the material effects of changes in the    \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day \nof the performance period. Three-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV was the      \naverage year-over-year percentage change in \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for the\nthree calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, \u201cadjusted       \ntangible book value\u201d for each year equaled our total common shareholders\u2019 equity, \nless (a) the impact of any capital actions approved (or not objected to) by the   \nFederal Reserve Board and/or approved by our company\u2019s Board, and less (b) the sum\nof the carrying value of: (i) goodwill and (ii) intangible assets excluding       \nmortgage servicing rights; adjusted for (iii) deferred tax liabilities directly   \nrelated to: (i) and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage change was measured after\nthe conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning balance as of January 1  \nand the ending balance as of December 31 of that year and, to the extent          \nnecessary, was normalized to exclude the material effects of changes in the       \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations adopted after the first day \nof the performance period.                                                        \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    71  \n                              \n                                        \n  Compensation\u00a0discussion\u00a0and\u00a0analysis  \n                                        \nb. 2023 Competitor group Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee periodically\nreviews compensation practices of competitors to evaluate market trends, pay      \nlevels, and relative performance in executive compensation, but without any       \nformulaic benchmarking.

To include appropriate companies from a\ncompetitive and strategic perspective, the Committee evaluated companies by       \ncriteria including industry, size, and business characteristics. For the leading  \nfinancial institutions (previously referred to as leading international financial \ninstitutions), the Committee determined a more well-rounded group of seven U.S.   \nand four international institutions representing the business segments in which we\noperate, including banking, credit card, and wealth management, would be useful   \nfor pay-for-performance analysis.

Retirement benefits We provide our named executive       \nofficers the opportunity to save for their retirement via employee and employer   \ncontributions to qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on the same\nterms as other U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract and     \nretain key people by providing a means to save for retirement. Certain named      \nexecutive officers also participate in various frozen qualified and nonqualified  \ndefined benefit pension plans. For more information about these plans, see        \n\u201cPension benefits table\u201d and \u201cNonqualified deferred compensation table\u201d on pages  \n81 and 82, respectively.                                                          \n                         \n  72    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                   \n  Compensation\u00a0and\u00a0Human\u00a0Capital\u00a0Committee\u00a0Report  \n                                                   \nd. Health and welfare benefits & perquisites Our named executive officers receive \nhealth and welfare benefits, such as medical, life, and long-term disability      \ncoverage, under plans generally available to all other U.S.-based salaried        \nemployees; in addition, our named executive officers are eligible to receive an   \nannual physical exam. Because we have internal expertise on financial advisory    \nmatters, we do not charge fees to our named executive officers for their use of   \nour financial advisory services for personal needs. We also may provide certain   \nnamed executive officers with secured parking. For information security purposes  \nand efficiency, named executive officers are permitted to use a car service when  \ncommuting to and from our offices or business-related events; participating named \nexecutive officers reimburse the company for incremental costs incurred. In       \nlimited circumstances, we may occasionally provide meals and allow spouses or     \nguests to accompany executives traveling for a business-related purpose and pay   \nfor other incidental expenses. Our policy provides for the use of corporate       \naircraft by senior management for approved travel. For reasons of security,       \npersonal safety, and efficiency, we require our CEO to use corporate aircraft for \nall air travel (business, commuting, and personal). Pursuant to his aircraft time-\nsharing agreement, our CEO reimbursed our company for costs related to his use of \nour aircraft for commuting. Our executive officers, including our named executive \nofficers, other than our CEO, are permitted to use corporate aircraft for limited \npersonal travel with reimbursement to the company for incremental costs, pursuant \nto their aircraft time-sharing agreements. e. Tax deductibility of compensation   \nU.S. tax law limits a public company\u2019s deductions to $1 million per year for      \ncompensation paid to its CEO, chief financial officer, and each of its three other\nmost highly compensated executive officers, as well as to any individual who was  \nsubject to the $1 million deduction limitation in 2017 or any later year. The     \nCommittee continues to retain the discretion to make awards and pay amounts that  \ndo not qualify as deductible.                                                     \n                                                  \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 2).                     \n                                                  \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee Report Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion  \nand Analysis that immediately precedes this report.

Typically, we grant stock awards early in the year as     \n       part of total year-end compensation awarded for prior year performance.    \n       As a result, the amounts for stock awards generally appear in the          \n       \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d for the year after the performance year upon  \n       which they were based, and therefore the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d      \n  (1)  does not fully reflect our Compensation and Human Capital Committee\u2019s      \n       view of its pay-for-performance executive compensation program for a       \n       particular performance year. For example, amounts shown as 2023            \n       compensation in the \u201cStock awards\u201d column include stock awards granted in  \n       February 2023 for 2022 performance, as well as other stock awards granted  \n       during 2023 that are not part of performance year 2023 compensation.

The grant date fair  \n       value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the applicable  \n       grant date ($35.56 on February 15, 2023). For the PRSUs granted in 2023,   \n       the actual number of PRSUs earned (0% up to the maximum level of 100%)     \n       will depend on our company\u2019s future achievement of specific ROA and        \n       growth in adjusted TBV standards (tax-normalized) over a three-year        \n       performance period ending December 31, 2025. Values in the \u201cStock awards\u201d  \n       column assume that 100% (the maximum level) of the PRSUs granted would     \n       vest as the probable outcome for purposes of determining the grant date    \n       fair value. The grant date fair value for PRSUs and TRSUs granted in 2023  \n  (5)  includes a discount rate of approximately 12% to reflect the impact of     \n       post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of these awards. The       \n       grant date fair value for the PRSUs and TRSUs granted in 2022 includes a   \n       discount of approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, and the grant date    \n       fair value for the PRSUs and TRSUs granted in 2021 includes a discount of  \n       approximately 14% and 15%, respectively, to reflect the impact of          \n       post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of these awards.

In late 2017, we amended our policy to require Mr.    \nMoynihan to use only corporate aircraft for all business, commuting, and personal \nflights. We generally do not consider amounts related to business- and/or         \nbusiness-development related flights as compensation to Mr. Moynihan, and we      \nconsider the amounts related to Mr. Moynihan\u2019s required personal and commuting use\nof our corporate aircraft to be necessary business expenses for reasons of        \nsecurity, personal safety, and efficiency. However, SEC rules require that we     \ninclude in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d the value of certain flights or       \nportions of certain flights as a perquisite. Therefore, the amount shown for Mr.  \nMoynihan for use of corporate aircraft primarily reflects the aggregate           \nincremental cost to our company for: (i) elements of business- and/or business-   \ndevelopment related flights and (ii) all personal flights taken for non-commuting,\nnon-businesspurposes. Under his aircraft time-sharing agreement, during 2023 Mr.  \nMoynihan reimbursed our company for certain incremental costs of flights on our   \ncorporate aircraft for commuting purposes. Mr. Moynihan is responsible for his own\ntaxes on any imputed income resulting from his personal use of our corporate      \naircraft. The tax equalization and related fees amount shown for Mr. Koder        \nrepresents tax equalization payments and related preparation fees for trailing    \nincome from restricted stock units granted prior to April 1, 2019.

Because the grant date fair value for these awards         \n       (excluding the award described in footnote 3) is based on the closing      \n       price of our common stock on the grant date ($35.56) on February 15,       \n  (2)  2023, the dollar amount of the grant date fair value will differ slightly  \n       from the original award value determined by our Compensation and Human     \n       Capital Committee. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs and the TRSUs    \n       granted in 2023 (excluding the TRSUs granted to Mr.\u00a0DeMare described in    \n       footnote 3 below) includes a discount of approximately 12% to reflect the  \n       impact of post-vesting transfer restrictions on the value of these         \n       awards. For additional information about the applicable assumptions for    \n       determining the grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards,     \n       see footnote 5 to the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d.                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       As described in more detail on page 66 in \u201cManagement team stock award,\u201d   \n       Mr.\u00a0DeMare was granted an award of 150,000 restricted stock units in       \n       February 2023, which vests in two equal annual installments beginning      \n       February 15, 2026. While the award was granted to Mr. DeMare on February   \n  (3)  15, 2023, SEC rules require disclosure of the grant date in accordance     \n       with FASB ASC Topic 718. Under ASC 718, the grant date is January 31,      \n       2023, and the grant date fair value is based on the closing price of our   \n       common stock on that day ($35.48).

For this purpose,      \n       \u201cadjusted tangible book value\u201d for each year will equal our total common   \n       shareholders\u2019 equity, less (a)\u00a0the cumulative impact of any capital        \n       actions approved by our company\u2019s Board and completed by Bank of America   \n       during the performance period, and less (b)\u00a0the sum of the carrying value  \n  \u2022    of: (i)\u00a0goodwill and (ii)\u00a0intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing   \n       rights; adjusted for (iii)\u00a0deferred tax liabilities directly related to    \n       (i)\u00a0and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage change is measured after the  \n       conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning balance as of         \n       January 1 and the ending balance as of December 31 of that year and, to    \n       the extent necessary, will be normalized to exclude the material effects   \n       of changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and related regulations    \n       adopted after the first day of the performance period.                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The awards are equally weighted with 50% based on ROA standards            \n       (tax-normalized) and 50% based on adjusted TBV growth standards. The       \n       portion of the PRSUs earned for the performance period depends on the      \n  \u2022    level of our average ROA and adjusted TBV growth. No PRSUs will be earned  \n       if results are below the minimum standards.

Deferred    \ncompensation plan. Each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate\nin the Bank of America Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan),   \nwhich is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allows for deferrals above   \nthe IRS limits on qualified plans. Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of   \nbase salary and up to 75% of certain eligible incentive awards. Employer          \ncontributions made under the plan, if any, when combined with the employer        \ncontributions under the 401(k) plan, will not exceed the maximum employer         \ncontributions allowable under the 401(k) Plan\u2014$12,500 for matching contributions  \nand $7,500 for annual company contributions. Participants may generally elect to  \nreceive their distribution in a lump-sumpayment or installments payable up to 15  \nyears. Participants are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that    \nthey deferred or any notional investment earnings (based on elections of the same \ninvestment options as under the 401(k) Plan) until those amounts are distributed  \nto them, and we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until they are       \ndistributed. Legacy deferred compensation plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia    \neach have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive        \nDeferred Compensation Plan No. 2 (Legacy Deferred Compensation Plan), which is a  \nnonqualified retirement savings plan. Prior to being closed to deferrals in 2002, \nparticipants could defer base salary and certain bonuses under the plan.          \nParticipants can elect payments in a lump-sumor up to 15 annual installments      \neither on or after termination of employment, but not beyond the year in which the\nparticipant turns 65.                                                             \n                         \n  82    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                          \n  Executive\u00a0compensation  \n                          \nLegacy supplemental plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia each have an account     \nunder the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Supplemental Plan (Legacy   \nSupplemental Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allowed  \ndeferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. This plan was closed to        \ncontributions in 2004. Payments are made in a lump-sumor up to 15 annual          \ninstallments beginning in the year of termination of employment or any later year \nelected by the participant, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns\n65. Legacy ESA plan. Mr. Athanasia has a nonqualified deferred compensation       \naccount that was established prior to FleetBoston\u2019s merger with Bank of America   \nCorporation and funded by employer contributions (Legacy ESA Plan). This plan was \nclosed to contributions in 2004. Upon his termination of employment, Mr. Athanasia\nwill be paid in equal installments over a one-yearrestrictive covenant period,    \nunless he terminates due to death or disability. Potential payments upon          \ntermination or change in control We do not have any agreements with our named     \nexecutive officers that provide for cash severance payments upon termination of   \nemployment or a change in control. In addition, since 2002, we have maintained the\nBank of America Corporation Corporate Policy Regarding Seeking Stockholder        \nApproval of Future Severance Agreements (the Severance Agreement Approval Policy).\nUnder our Severance Agreement Approval Policy, we will not enter into employment  \nor severance agreements with our executive officers that provide severance        \nbenefits exceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined under the Severance\nAgreement Approval Policy), unless the agreement has been approved by our         \nshareholders. Potential payments from equity-based awards Our equity-based awards \nto our named executive officers include standard provisions that cause awards to  \nvest or be forfeited upon termination of employment, depending on the reason for  \ntermination. These provisions for awards granted in 2023 are described in more    \ndetail on page 76, and those details can be found for awards granted in prior     \nyears in our prior proxy statements. In general, our awards provide for continued \npayments on the original schedule after certain types of termination of           \nemployment, subject to the following conditions, as applicable in individual award\nagreements:                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n       In case of a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d, the award continues to be paid      \n       according to the award\u2019s payment schedule if the executive complies with   \n       certain covenants, including not working for a competitive business. A     \n       Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or involuntary termination      \n       (other than for death, disability, or cause) after the executive has met   \n       certain specified age and/or service requirements. For awards granted      \n       before February 15, 2022, the named executive officers must have at least  \n       10 years of service and their age and years of service must add up to at   \n       least 60 (sometimes referred to in prior years as \u201cRule of 60\u201d). For       \n       awards granted on or after February 15, 2022 but before February\u00a015,       \n       2024, the named executive officers must have at least 10 years of service  \n       and reached at least age 50. Currently, each of the named executive        \n       officers meets the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination.   \n       For awards granted on or after February\u00a015, 2024, the named executive      \n       officers must have at least 10 years of service and reached at least age   \n  \u2022    55 or must have reached at least age 60.                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Awards remain subject to performance-based cancellation prior to payment   \n       and may be canceled in whole or in part if losses occur. Awards also can   \n       be canceled or recouped if the executive engages in detrimental conduct.   \n       Further, under our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, which was     \n  \u2022    updated in September 2023 to reflect the SEC\u2019s final rules implementing    \n       Section\u00a0954 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board can require reimbursement of  \n       any incentive compensation paid to an executive officer whose fraud or     \n       intentional misconduct causes our company to restate its financial         \n       statements and can claw back certain incentive compensation if an          \n       accounting restatement is required.                                        \n                                                                                  \nAwards to our named executive officers under the BACEP are generally designed to  \nbe paid per schedule if an executive\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d or\nfor \u201cgood reason\u201d within two years after a change in control. This change in      \ncontrol treatment is often referred to as \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting, because it    \nrequires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary          \ntermination (either by our company without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood  \nreason\u201d). The BACEP does not provide our executive officers \u201csingle trigger\u201d      \nvesting upon a change in control. If a named executive officer is terminated for  \n\u201ccause,\u201d our equity-based awards provide that the awards will be forfeited. The   \nfollowing table shows the value of equity awards that would have been payable,    \nsubject to the non-competeor compliance with covenants, as applicable, for a      \ntermination of employment as of December 31, 2023. For this purpose, restricted   \nstock units were valued at our closing price as of December 29, 2023, which was   \n$33.67 per share. Due to a number of factors that affect the nature and amount of \nany benefits provided upon termination of employment, any actual amounts paid or  \ndistributed may vary from the amounts listed below. Factors that could affect     \nthese amounts include the time during the year of any such event, any accrued but \nunpaid cash dividend equivalents and related interest, and the price of our common\nstock.                                                                            \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    83  \n                              \n                          \n  Executive\u00a0compensation  \n                          \nPotential payments from restricted stock units                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                   Ter\u2026                           \n                                                   with                           \n                                                   good                           \n                                                   rea\u2026                           \n                                                   or            All              \n                                                   wit\u2026          other            \n         Dea\u2026          Dis\u2026                        cau\u2026          term\u2026            \n                                                   wit\u2026          exce\u2026            \n                                                   two           for\u00a0             \n                                                   yea\u2026          cause            \n                                                   fol\u2026                           \n                                                   cha\u2026                           \n                                                   in                             \n                                                   con\u2026                           \n                                     Pay\u2026          Pay\u2026          Paya\u2026            \n                                     per\u00a0          per           per\u00a0             \n         Pay\u2026          Pay\u2026          awa\u2026          awa\u2026          award            \n  Na\u2026    imm\u2026          imm\u2026          sch\u2026          sch\u2026          sche\u2026            \n         ($)           ($)           sub\u2026          sub\u2026          subj\u2026            \n                                     to            to\u00a0           to               \n                                     con\u2026          con\u2026          cond\u2026            \n                                     ($)\u2026          ($)           ($)(\u2026            \n  Br\u2026                                                                             \n  T.           50,\u2026          1,3\u2026          49,\u2026          49,\u2026           49,\u2026      \n  Mo\u2026                                                                             \n  Al\u2026                                                                             \n  M.           17,\u2026             0          17,\u2026          17,\u2026           12,\u2026  -3  \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  C.           23,\u2026             0          23,\u2026          23,\u2026           18,\u2026      \n  At\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                                                                             \n  P.           30,\u2026             0          30,\u2026          30,\u2026           25,\u2026  -3  \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  Ma\u2026                                                                             \n  M.           27,\u2026             0          27,\u2026          27,\u2026           21,\u2026  -3  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       The conditions for payment include: (i)\u00a0compliance with covenants          \n       regarding non-solicitation, detrimental conduct, and compliance with       \n       anti-hedging/derivative transactions policies; (i) the performance-based   \n       cancellation described above; and (iii)\u00a0compliance with the Qualifying     \n       Termination conditions described above (other than in case of              \n  (1)  Disability), as provided in individual award agreements.

The value\nof those benefits as of December 31, 2023 is set forth in the sections above      \nentitled \u201cPension benefits table\u201d and \u201cNonqualified deferred compensation table.\u201d \nThere are no special or enhanced benefits under those plans for our named         \nexecutive officers, and all of our named executive officers are fully vested in   \nthe benefits discussed in those sections. We make tax and financial planning      \nadvisory services available to our named executive officers during their          \nemployment with us. The standard form of this benefit continues through the end of\nthe year in which the executive ceases employment, including preparation of that  \nyear\u2019s tax returns. This benefit may continue for an extended term of up to five  \nyears if the executive meets the age and service standard for a Qualifying        \nTermination and does not engage in any full-time employment. The benefit offered  \nduring the extended term will end during the calendar year any other full-time    \nemployment begins; the benefit, however, will end immediately following           \ntermination for cause, or if the executive engages in detrimental conduct or      \nbegins employment with a named competitor. Benefits-eligible Bank of America      \nemployees who retire with at least 10 years of service and their age plus years of\nservice equal to at least 60 have access to continued coverage under our group    \nhealth plan program, but the employee generally must pay for the full cost of that\ncoverage on an after-tax basis without any employer subsidy.                      \n                         \n  84    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                 \n  CEO\u00a0pay\u00a0ratio  \n                 \nCEO pay ratio Below is: (i) the 2023 annual total compensation of our CEO; (ii)   \nthe 2023 annual total compensation of our median employee; (iii) the ratio of the \nannual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee; and (iv) the \nmethodology we used to calculate our CEO pay ratio:                               \n                                                              \n  CEO pay ratio                                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CEO annual total compensation*               $  28,579,834  \n  Median employee annual total compensation    $     124,221  \n  CEO to median employee pay ratio                     230:1  \n                                                              \n                                                                                  \n  *  This annual total compensation is the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d amount,   \n     plus certain nondiscriminatory benefits (including health insurance).        \n                                                                                  \nMethodology Our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner     \nconsistent with SEC rules.

We began with our global employee          \n       population as of October 1, 2023, including full-time, part-time, and      \n       seasonal or temporary workers, employed by Bank of America or our          \n  \u2022    consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding our CEO.                          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Identified the median employee. We calculated compensation for each        \n       employee using base salary as of October 1, 2023 and estimated overtime,   \n       plus performance year 2022 cash incentives paid and equity awards granted  \n       in 2023. We identified employees within $500 of the median compensation    \n       and removed those employees who had anomalous compensation                 \n       characteristics. For each remaining employee, we estimated total           \n  \u2022    compensation using a method similar to the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d    \n       rules, but including employer health insurance contributions and the       \n       value of other benefits, and then identified the median employee.          \n       However, as permitted by SEC rules, we selected a median employee who had  \n       compensation substantially similar to our 2023 median employee because     \n       our 2023 median employee\u2019s incentive compensation structure changed        \n       mid-year resulting in a significant increase to their compensation.        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Calculated CEO pay ratio. We calculated our median employee\u2019s annual       \n       total compensation for 2023 according to the SEC\u2019s instructions for        \n  \u2022    preparing the \u201cSummary compensation table,\u201d including employer health      \n       insurance contributions and the value of other benefits. We then           \n       calculated our CEO\u2019s annual total compensation using the same approach to  \n       determine the pay ratio shown above.                                       \n                                                                                  \nWe invest in our employees at all levels in the company by rewarding performance  \nthat balances risk and reward, empowering professional growth and development, and\nby offering affordable benefits and programs that meet the diverse needs of our   \nemployees and their families.

Our pay-for-performance approach bases    \ncompensation on actual results and how those results were achieved. We align      \nexecutive and shareholder interests through a compensation program providing a mix\nof salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time, including deferred equity-    \nbased awards. Review our \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d on page 53 for    \nmore information on executive compensation considerations and decisions for our   \nnamed executive officers. Page 65 of the \u201cCompensation discussion and analysis\u201d   \nincludes 2023 compensation decisions for our named executive officers; these      \ndecisions are different than those reflected in the table below which are         \ncalculated under prescribed SEC rules.                                            \nThe table below shows the following information for the past four fiscal years:   \n(i) \u201ctotal\u201d compensation for our named executive officers (NEOs) for purposes of  \nthe \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d; (ii) the \u201cCompensation actually paid\u201d to named  \nexecutive officers (calculated using rules required by the SEC); (iii) our total  \nshareholder return (TSR); (iv) the TSR of the KBW Bank Index; (v)\u00a0our net income; \nand (vi)\u00a0our revenue (which is our \u201ccompany-selected performance measure\u201d).       \n\u201cCompensation actually paid\u201d does not represent the value of cash and shares of   \nthe company\u2019s common stock received by named executive officers during the year,  \nbut rather is an amount calculated under SEC rules and includes, among other      \nthings, year-over-year changes in the value of unvested equity-based awards.

In selecting and approving a lead engagement   \npartner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by      \nmanagement and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates,           \nassessments of their professional experience, and input from our company\u2019s        \nindependent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an   \nannual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm. It        \nconsiders, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best        \ninterests of our company and its shareholders, taking into account the firm\u2019s     \nquality of service, the firm\u2019s institutional knowledge and experience, the firm\u2019s \ninternational capabilities, the firm\u2019s sufficiency of resources, the quality of   \nthe communication and interaction with the firm, and the firm\u2019s independence,     \nobjectivity, and professional skepticism. The Committee also considers the        \nadvisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered \npublic accounting firm. After assessing the qualifications, performance, and      \nindependence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which has served as our         \ncompany\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm since 1958, the Committee \nbelieves that retaining PwC is in the best interests of our company. The Committee\nhas appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit   \nthe 2024 consolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its \nsubsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking           \nshareholders to ratify PwC\u2019s appointment. If our shareholders do not ratify PwC\u2019s \nappointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered      \npublic accounting firm for 2024. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC\u2019s         \nappointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public  \naccounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate.   \nPwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with      \nrespect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of  \nthe SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Under the Plan, we have    \nreserved a number of shares of our common stock for issuance to employees         \n(including executive officers) as equity-based awards in the form of restricted   \nstock, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock options, and SARs and for issuance to \nnon-employeedirectors as restricted stock awards. The BACEP is currently scheduled\nto expire on April 24, 2033. In March 2024, our Board approved the amendment and  \nrestatement of the BACEP to increase the number of common shares available to     \ngrant, subject to the approval of our shareholders at the annual meeting. Impact  \nof the amendment and restatement based on information as of March 1, 2024 As of   \nMarch 1, 2024, under the current authorization, there are approximately 67 million\nshares of common stock available for grant as equity- based awards under the      \nBACEP. Based on our current grant practices, these shares would last less than one\nyear, while the current BACEP term has nine years remaining. We believe it is     \nappropriate to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for    \nawards under the BACEP so that our company can continue the practice of granting  \ndeferred equity-based awards in lieu of cash. We estimate the total dilutive      \neffect of the BACEP and our legacy stock plans on our shareholders (sometimes     \ncalled \u201coverhang\u201d) resulting from the amendment and restatement would be          \napproximately 5.3%, with the incremental overhang resulting from the requested    \nshare increase equal to approximately 1.3%. The overhang is calculated as follows,\nin each case as of March 1, 2024:                                                 \n                                                                          \n  (a) Incremental share request subject to                100,000,000     \n  shareholder approval                                                    \n  (b) Shares underlying outstanding awards of                             \n  restricted shares / stock-settled restricted stock      274,252,674     \n  units under all equity plans(1)                                         \n  (c) Options outstanding under all equity plans(2)                 0     \n  (d) Shares currently available for future issuance       66,611,273     \n  under all equity plans(3)                                               \n  (e) Total shares available for, or outstanding          440,863,947     \n  under, equity awards (a + b + c + d)                                    \n  (f) Total common shares outstanding                   7,890,638,876     \n  (g) Fully diluted overhang (e/(e+f))(4)                         5.3  %  \n  (h) Basic diluted overhang (e/f)                                5.6  %  \n                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n       Includes 6,127,638 vested RSUs subject to a required six- or twelve-month  \n       holding period and 9,835,711 vested RSUs that are expected to be           \n  (1)  issued/delivered within 30 days of the record date.

Additionally, our rate at which\nwe grant equity awards relative to shares of our common stock outstanding         \n(sometimes referred to as \u201crun rate\u201d) was below the average run rate for our      \nprimary competitor group on a one-yearand three-year average basis. If the        \nproposed amendment and restatement is approved, we expect the pool of requested   \nshares to last approximately one year, assuming we maintain similar grant         \npractices as over the past two years and assuming, hypothetically, our current    \nstock price remains constant. The number of shares remaining available for grant  \nunder the BACEP as noted in the previous table differs from those reported as of  \nDecember 31, 2023 because that information does not take into account year-to-    \ndategrants during 2024 for the 2023 performance year. Information regarding the   \nnumber of shares remaining available for grant as required by SEC disclosure rules\nare discussed in detail in this proposal under \u201cAdditional information\u201d on page   \n96. The list of companies included in our primary competitor group is detailed    \nunder \u201c2023 Competitor group\u201d on page 72. Purpose of the Plan The Plan, and the   \nproposed amendment and restatement of it, is intended to serve a critical role in \nour pay-for-performancecompensation program and is necessary for us to comply with\nthe regulatory landscape in certain jurisdictions. In addition, our Board believes\nthat equity-based awards aid in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our   \nemployees and are the most direct way to align employee interests with those of   \nshareholders. As part of our pay-for-performancepractices, more than 100,000      \nemployees receive variable incentives. More highly compensated employees receive a\nportion of their variable incentive as deferred RSUs. The portion of the variable \nincentive deferred as equity-based awards generally increases with compensation   \nlevels according to a predetermined deferral grid. RSUs are also a significant    \ncomponent of the Sharing Success stock awards that have been or will be made to   \napproximately 97% of employees in March 2024. Most Sharing Success awards are in  \nthe form of company common stock, providing the opportunity to further share in   \nour company\u2019s long-term success. The RSU awards are a key                         \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    91  \n                              \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \npart of our pay-for-performancephilosophy, and in many cases are required by law, \nrule, and regulation. In addition, our executive officers receive PRSUs that must \nbe re-earnedby meeting specific performance criteria, as described on page 68 for \nawards granted in February 2024. Equity awards granted to employees are subject to\ncancellation and clawback features which encourage appropriate behavior and manage\nrisk in our compensation program; these features are described on page 70.        \nGranting RSU awards that include deferral, cancellation, and clawback features is \na key risk-balancing mechanism in our pay-for-performancecompensation program, and\nserves to align employee interests with shareholder interests while complying with\nregulatory requirements. The value of RSUs tracks the price of our common shares. \nCompensation expense is in the compensation and benefits expense line of the      \nincome statement. The Plan, and the proposed amendment and restatement of it, is  \nintended to be the company\u2019s vehicle for delivering deferred equity-based awards. \nSince April 2021, the amount of common stock awarded has averaged approximately   \n110 million shares each year, which includes approximately 23.3 million shares to \nbe granted in March 2024 under the Sharing Success award program leaving          \napproximately 43 million shares remaining for future awards. The Board has        \ndetermined to increase the shares of our common stock available for awards under  \nthe Plan by 100 million shares to enable the granting of Plan awards in the       \nfuture. The alternative would be to increase the use of deferred cash awards,     \nwhich we believe would reduce alignment with shareholder interests. Therefore, the\nBoard recommends the amendment and restatement to increase the number of shares of\ncommon stock available for awards under the Plan. In addition, the company has and\ncontinues to repurchase shares of common stock in an amount at least equal to the \nvalue of stock-settled equity awards as they are recognized into capital. These   \nshare repurchases offset the net new shares of common stock delivered under the   \nBACEP. The company currently intends to continue this repurchase practice. The    \ncompany\u2019s common stock repurchases are subject to required regulatory and Board   \napprovals. The additional 100 million shares to be authorized under the BACEP     \nwould allow our company to continue current grant practices for approximately one \nyear. Overview of the amendment and restatement The following is a summary of the \nmaterial terms of the proposed amendment and restatement and is qualified, in its \nentirety, by reference to the terms of the BACEP. A copy of the BACEP, approved by\nthe Board in March 2024, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. The   \nonly proposed material change to the Plan is an increase by 100 million shares to \nthe number of shares available for awards under the Plan. There are no proposed   \nchanges to the shareholder-friendly design features of the Plan, summarized on    \npage 90. The proposed amendment and restatement will become effective only if the \nBACEP is approved by our shareholders. Number of shares The BACEP, as last        \napproved by shareholders in 2023, provides that the aggregate number of shares of \nour common stock available for grants of awards under the Plan from and after     \nJanuary 1, 2015 will not exceed the sum of (i) 450 million shares, plus (ii) any  \nshares that were subject to an award as of December 31, 2014 under the BACEP, if  \nsuch award is canceled, terminates, expires, lapses or is settled in cash for any \nreason from and after January 1, 2015, plus (iii) effective upon April 24, 2019,  \n150 million shares, plus (iv) effective upon April 20, 2021, 115 million shares,  \nplus (v) effective upon April 25, 2023, 75 million shares. As of March 1, 2024    \nthere were approximately 67 million common shares available for future awards     \nunder the BACEP. The amendment and restatement, if approved by shareholders, would\nincrease the number of shares available for awards by 100 million shares, to      \napproximately 167 million shares estimated based on information available on March\n1, 2024. Under the BACEP, each award, whether granted as a stock option, SAR,     \nrestricted stock share or RSU, counts against the available share pool as one     \nshare for each share awarded. The share re-useprovisions under the BACEP do not   \ninclude any \u201cliberal share counting\u201d features for stock options or SARs. Shares   \nused to cover the exercise price of stock options or to cover any tax withholding \nobligations in connection with awards of stock options or SARs will continue to be\nunavailable for awards under the BACEP. In addition, the total number of shares   \ncovering stock-settled SARs or net-settledoptions will be counted against the pool\nof available shares, not just the net shares issued upon exercise. The BACEP does \nallow shares withheld to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection with \nawards of restricted stock or RSUs to again be available for future awards under  \nthe BACEP. Shares covered by awards will also continue to be available for awards \nif and to the extent (a) the award is canceled or forfeited or (b) the award is   \nsettled in cash.                                                                  \n                         \n  92    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nAdministration The Compensation and Human Capital Committee (Committee)           \nadministers the BACEP.

Eligibility Employees of Bank of America and its        \nsubsidiaries may participate in the BACEP, as selected by the Committee. Eligible \nemployees are those employees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries who have    \nmade, or are expected to make, important contributions to our business, as        \ndetermined by the Committee, including persons employed outside the United States.\nApproximately 195,000 employees are expected to be eligible to participate.       \nHowever, as mentioned above, the Committee in its discretion selects which        \nemployees will receive any awards. The BACEP also provides for awards of          \nrestricted stock to non-employeedirectors as part of our director compensation    \nprogram. All 12 of the non-employeedirectors nominated for election at the annual \nmeeting are eligible to receive these restricted stock awards. As noted elsewhere \nin this proxy statement, as part of our director compensation program, our Board  \ngrants restricted stock to directors on the day of their election or appointment  \nas a director. Any director nominee that receives at least a majority of votes    \ncast at the annual meeting will be elected at the annual meeting and will be      \neligible to receive the restricted stock award as part of their 2024-2025 director\ncompensation. In the event this proposed amendment and restatement does not       \nreceive at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, and the      \namendment and restatement does not become effective, there are enough common      \nshares remaining for issuance to grant directors elected at the annual meeting the\n2024-2025 restricted stock award. Types of awards The BACEP permits awards of     \nstock options, SARs, restricted stock shares and RSUs to employees and restricted \nstock shares to non-employeedirectors, all of which are described in more detail  \nbelow. Awards of stock options and SARs . The BACEP provides for the grant of     \noptions to purchase shares of our common stock at option prices which are not less\nthan the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the close of business\non the date of grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of \nMarch 1, 2024, was $34.35.) The BACEP also provides for the grant of SARs to      \nemployees. SARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares \nof our common stock or a combination of the two, as the Committee in its          \ndiscretion may determine, with a value equal to the difference between: (i) the   \nfair market value on the exercise date of the shares with respect to which a SAR  \nis exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.  \nAwards of options under the BACEP, which may be either incentive stock options    \n(which qualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock options, are      \ndetermined by the Committee. No more than an aggregate of 450 million shares may  \nbe awarded as incentive stock options under the BACEP. The terms and conditions of\neach option and SAR are to be determined by the Committee (or its designees) at   \nthe time of grant. Options and SARs granted under the BACEP will expire not more  \nthan 10 years from the date of grant, and the award agreements entered into with  \neach participant will specify the extent to which options and SARs may be         \nexercised during their respective terms, including in the event of the            \nparticipant\u2019s death, disability, or termination of employment. The BACEP includes \ntwo additional limitations on stock option and SAR grants.                        \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The BACEP expressly prohibits dividend equivalents with respect to stock   \n       options and SARs.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    93  \n                              \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n       Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, the BACEP prohibits the   \n       sale, transfer, pledge, assignment, or other alienation or hypothecation   \n  \u2022    (including to, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the         \n       foregoing restrictions, third-party financial institutions) of             \n       nonqualified stock options and SARS.                                       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board has not granted stock options or SARs since 2008. Awards of restricted  \nstock shares and RSUs . Under the BACEP, the Committee may award employees        \nrestricted shares of our common stock or RSUs which represent the right to receive\nshares of our common stock (or cash equal to the fair market value of those       \nshares). Each award agreement will contain the terms of the award, including any  \napplicable conditions, which may include continued service of the participant, the\nattainment of specified performance goals or any other conditions deemed          \nappropriate by the Committee. Restricted stock shares will be held in our custody \nuntil the applicable restrictions have been satisfied. The participant cannot     \nsell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate (including to,\nfor the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing restrictions, third-\nparty financial institutions) restricted stock shares until the applicable        \nrestrictions are satisfied. Once the restrictions are satisfied, the shares will  \nbe delivered to the participant\u2019s account, free of restrictions. During the period\nof restriction, the participant may exercise full voting rights with respect to   \nthe restricted stock shares. The award agreement for any RSUs will specify whether\nunits that become earned and payable will be settled in shares of our common stock\n(with one share of common stock to be delivered for each earned and payable RSU), \nin cash (equal to the aggregate fair market value of the RSUs that are earned and \npayable), or in a combination of shares and cash. Shares of our common stock used \nto pay earned RSUs may have additional restrictions, as determined by the         \nCommittee. The BACEP also provides for awards of restricted stock shares to our   \nnon-employeedirectors as part of our director compensation program. These awards  \nvest one year after the date of grant or, if earlier, at the date of the next     \nannual meeting. However, awards that are scheduled to vest in less than 50 weeks  \nafter the date of grant will count against the 5% exception pool for the minimum  \nvesting requirements described below. The awards vest earlier in case of death or \na change in control. If a non-employeedirector retires before the one-yearvesting \ndate, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the non-   \nemployeedirector served during the vesting period before retirement. Awards may be\ndeferred under the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan. See        \n\u201cDirector compensation\u201d on page 50 for additional details about our director      \ncompensation program. Subject to the terms of the BACEP and any applicable award  \nagreement, a participant may be entitled to receive dividends or dividend         \nequivalents with respect to an award of restricted stock or RSUs. Dividends or    \ndividend equivalents may be credited as cash or as additional shares or units.    \nHowever, in no event will dividends or dividend equivalents vest or otherwise be  \npaid out prior to the time that the underlying award (or portion thereof) has     \nvested and, accordingly, any such dividends or dividend equivalents will be       \nsubject to cancellation and forfeiture if the underlying award does not vest      \n(including both time-based and performance-based awards). Minimum vesting         \nconditions The BACEP provides that generally all stock-settled awards will vest no\nmore quickly than ratably annually as of each anniversary over a three-year period\nbeginning on the grant date of the award. This requirement does not apply to (i)  \ncertain substitute awards arising from acquisitions; (ii) shares delivered in lieu\nof fully vested cash incentive awards; (iii) awards to non-employeedirectors that \nvest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant or the next  \nannual meeting of shareholders (but not sooner than 50 weeks after the grant      \ndate); or (iv) awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals over\na period of at least one year. Also, the Committee may grant equity-based awards  \nwithout regard to the minimum vesting requirement with respect to a maximum of 5% \nof the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the BACEP. In        \naddition, the minimum vesting requirement does not apply to the Committee\u2019s       \ndiscretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any award,     \nincluding in cases of retirement, workforce reduction, death, disability, or a    \nchange in control, in the terms of the award or otherwise. Section 162(m) award   \nlimits Prior to 2018, awards under the BACEP could be designed to qualify as      \n\u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d that were intended to be exempt from the         \ndeduction limits under Section 162(m) of the Code. Under the pre-2018Section      \n162(m) rules, the plan under which awards were granted had to include certain     \nshareholder-approved individual award limits in order for awards to qualify as    \nperformance-based compensation. The BACEP included such individual award limits,  \nwhich were limited to options/SARs and performance-based restricted stock and RSU \nawards that were intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) performance-based     \ncompensation exception. Although changes in the U.S. tax laws made by the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d exception for\ngrants made from and after January 1, 2018, the BACEP continues to include award  \nlimits, by which a participant may not be granted in any calendar year: (i) stock \noptions or SARs for more than 4,000,000 shares, or (ii) performance-based         \nrestricted stock shares/RSUs for more than 4,000,000 shares (assuming maximum     \nperformance).                                                                     \n                         \n  94    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                         \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nWithholding for payment of taxes The BACEP provides for the withholding and       \npayment by a participant of any payroll or withholding taxes required by          \napplicable law. The BACEP permits a participant to satisfy this requirement, with \nthe approval of the Committee and subject to the terms of the BACEP, by           \nwithholding from the participant a number of shares of the company\u2019s common stock \notherwise issuable under the award having a fair market value equal to the amount \nof applicable payroll and withholding taxes. It also permits the company and the  \nparticipant to withhold at rates up to the maximum statutory tax rates.           \nAdjustments for changes in capitalization In the event of any change in the number\nof our outstanding shares of common stock by reason of any stock dividend, split, \nspin-off,recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares \nor otherwise, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock with respect to  \nwhich awards may be made under the BACEP, the annual limit on individual awards,  \nthe limits on incentive stock options, restricted stock and RSUs, and the terms,  \ntypes of shares and number of shares of any outstanding awards under the BACEP    \nwill be equitably adjusted by the Committee in its discretion to preserve the     \nbenefit of the award for us and the participant. No single trigger vesting upon a \nchange in control for employees The BACEP permits the Committee to provide for    \nvesting of awards to employees in connection with a change in control of Bank of  \nAmerica if there is also a termination of employment in connection with the change\nin control. This is often referred to as \u201cdouble trigger\u201d vesting. For these      \npurposes, a termination is considered to be in connection with a change in control\nif it occurs upon or within two years after the change in control and is for one  \nof the following two reasons: (i) an involuntary termination by the company       \nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or (ii) a termination by the employee for \u201cgood reason.\u201d \u201cCause\u201d  \nand \u201cgood reason\u201d will be as defined in the applicable award agreements. In       \naddition, the Committee may provide for the assumption or substitution of awards  \nby a surviving corporation. Awards to non-employeedirectors fully vest upon a     \nchange in control. Amendment and termination of the Plan Our Board has the power  \nto amend, modify or terminate the BACEP on a prospective basis, provided that no  \ntermination, amendment or modification shall adversely affect in any material way \nany award previously granted under the Plan without the written consent of any    \naffected participant. Shareholder approval will be obtained for any change to the \nmaterial terms of the BACEP to the extent required by NYSE listing requirements or\nother applicable law. The BACEP, as amended, automatically terminates at the close\nof business on April 24, 2033 following which no awards may be made under the     \nBACEP. Option and SARs repricing prohibited The BACEP specifically prohibits the  \nrepricing of stock options or SARs without shareholder approval. For this purpose,\na \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the following (or any other action that has the same   \neffect as any of the following): (i) changing the terms of a stock option or SAR  \nto lower its exercise price; (ii) any other action that is treated as a           \n\u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting principles; and (iii) repurchasing\nfor cash or canceling a stock option or SAR at a time when its exercise price is  \ngreater than the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another\naward, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with change in   \ncapitalization or similar change. Such cancellation and exchange would be         \nconsidered a \u201crepricing\u201d regardless of whether it is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d     \nunder generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is    \nvoluntary on the part of the employee. Federal income tax treatment The following \ndiscussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards under\nthe BACEP based on the law as in effect on the date of this document. The         \nfollowing discussion does not purport to cover federal employment taxes or other  \nfederal tax consequences that may be employed with awards, nor does it cover      \nstate, local or non-U.S.taxes. Nonqualified stock options. A participant generally\nwill not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified     \nstock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the    \nexercise of a nonqualified stock option, a participant generally will recognize   \ncompensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference      \nbetween the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the    \ndate of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option. When a participant   \nsells the shares, the participant will have short-term or long-term capital gain  \nor loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount the       \nparticipant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax  \nbasis of the shares generally will be equal to the fair market value of the shares\non the exercise date.                                                             \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    95  \n                              \n                                                      \n  Proposal 4: Proposal to amend and restate the Bank  \n  of America Corporation Equity Plan                  \n                                                      \nIncentive stock options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income\nupon the grant of an incentive stock option. If a participant exercises an        \nincentive stock option during employment or within three months after employment  \nends (12 months in the case of permanent and total disability), the participant   \nwill not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes (although the participant generally will have taxable income  \nfor alternative minimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option were a   \nnonqualified stock option). If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the   \nshares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option after the later of (a) \none year from the date the participant exercised the option and (b) two years from\nthe grant date of the stock option, the participant generally will recognize long-\nterm capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the          \nparticipant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock       \noption. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon      \nexercise of an incentive stock option before these holding period requirements are\nsatisfied, the disposition will constitute a \u201cdisqualifying disposition,\u201d and the \nparticipant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of       \ndisposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date\nof exercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or, if less, the excess  \nof the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of\nthe stock option). The balance of the participant\u2019s gain on a disqualifying       \ndisposition, if any, will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain, as the\ncase may be. With respect to both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock  \noptions, special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already \nheld by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon  \nexercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by   \nthe participant. Stock appreciation rights. A participant generally will not      \nrecognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at \nleast equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and \nno additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a SAR, a participant         \ngenerally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount     \nequal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the\nSAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of the SAR. Restricted stock      \nshares and RSUs. A participant generally will not have taxable income upon the    \ngrant of restricted stock or RSUs. Instead, the participant will recognize        \nordinary income at the time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value   \n(on the vesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount   \npaid. For restricted stock only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at   \nthe time of grant. Tax consequences to Bank of America. In the foregoing cases, we\ngenerally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same       \namount, as a participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to certain           \nlimitations imposed under the Code, including those imposed by Section 162(m) as  \napplicable. New stock plan benefits Because awards under the BACEP are            \ndiscretionary, awards are generally not determinable at this time. As stated      \npreviously, in the event the proposed amendment and restatement is not approved by\nshareholders at the annual meeting, there are enough shares remaining under the   \nPlan for the Board to grant restricted stock awards to directors elected at the   \nannual meeting as part of 2024-2025 director compensation.

We recognize that the submission of proposals for inclusion\nin our proxy statement is one mechanism for shareholders to convey their          \npriorities, perspectives, and concerns to us. We encourage shareholders           \ncontemplating a shareholder proposal submission to reach out to us beforehand.    \nThis allows us to better understand their perspective and objectives, to brief    \nmanagement and the Board or its committees on the input we receive, and to share  \nor direct shareholders to information on our existing policies, practices, and    \ninitiatives. Of the six shareholder proposals set forth below, only the           \nshareholder representative Trillium Asset Management contacted us on its          \nshareholder proposal prior to submission. For additional information regarding our\nactive shareholder engagement program, see \u201cShareholder engagement\u201d on page 37,   \nand for more information on the shareholder proposal process, see \u201cShareholder    \nproposals for our 2025 annual meeting\u201d on page 113. When we receive a shareholder \nproposal, we carefully review and discuss it with internal subject matter experts \nwho have familiarity and insight on the matters raised by the proposal, and we    \nreview the proposal with management and the Board. We also seek engagement with   \nshareholder proponents, and we contacted and engaged with each of the proponents  \nof the shareholder proposals set forth below, or their representatives. These     \nproposals fall into two broad categories:                                         \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    those seeking changes to our corporate governance or executive             \n       compensation practices, and                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                            \n  \u2022    those seeking changes to or reports on how we conduct our business.  \n                                                                            \nAmong the former, the proposals seek discrete changes that have been repeatedly   \nconsidered and rejected by our shareholders, that are less favorable to           \nshareholders than our existing practices, or that propose novel and untested      \nconcepts. Because of this, we believe these proposals are not in shareholders\u2019    \nbest interests and fail to recognize the robust governance policies and practices \nalready in place at our company. For the proposals seeking changes to or reports  \non how we conduct our business, we appreciate the issues raised in many of the    \nproposals, and in some cases, have already taken actions to address them,         \nincluding providing extensive public disclosures on the specific subject matter   \nraised in the proposals. Where we have not already implemented the changes or     \nprepared the reports requested, we consider their usefulness to shareholders, the \ncosts involved, and the potential conflicts of such requests with our existing    \npractices and disclosures. Similarly, we may receive multiple proposals on a      \ncommon topic, where implementation of all the distinct (and sometimes             \ncontradictory) proposals would conflict with our existing initiatives, commitments\nand reporting processes, or would be redundant, create confusion, and impede the  \nprogress we continue to make toward our goals, which would not be a productive use\nof corporate assets. For example, consistent with our commitment to Responsible   \nGrowth, we continue to make progress on our strategy to support and finance the   \ntransition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy. This strategy presents          \nsignificant opportunities to our lines of businesses; since 2021, we recorded over\n$316 billion in climate-related finance business. We have provided extensive      \ndisclosure through multiple public reports over many years on our strategy, its   \nobjectives, timelines, and targets, and the tactics we employ to achieve them. For\nmore information on our efforts, see \u201cResponsible Growth: Growth that is          \nSustainable\u201d on page 39. We are implementing this strategy and executing it at a  \nscale that includes how we engage with tens of thousands of clients across        \nthousands of client teams and pertaining to hundreds of billions of dollars of    \nassets. We benchmark our strategy against publicly disclosed standards and        \nindustry practices and we seek to support our clients in achieving their own      \ntransition strategies. These benchmarks are designed to provide decision-useful   \nmetrics to investors seeking to understand the opportunities and risks in our     \nstrategy. While individual elements of our comprehensive strategy may be designed \nsomewhat differently than the varied approaches prescribed in each of the climate-\nrelated proposals below, our targeted outcomes are, in general, often precisely   \nwhat the proponents themselves envision. Our approach is designed to further the  \nlong-term interests of our company, our shareholders, and other stakeholders. As  \nexplained in our Board\u2019s response to each proposal, we believe that implementing  \nany or all of these proposals would impede our ability to continue to deliver     \nagainst our strategy and the scale on which we operate and hamper the progress we \nare making on our transition plan. Finally, it is important to note that a number \nof shareholder proposals below contain claims that we believe are incorrect or    \nmisleading, although we have not attempted to refute all of them. For the reasons \ndescribed below, our Board recommends a vote AGAINST each shareholder proposal.   \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    97  \n                              \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nProposal 5: Shareholder proposal requesting report on risks of politicized de-    \nbanking Leonard E. Crumpler, c/o Bowyer Research, 6300 Smithfield Street,         \nMcKeesport, PA 15135, the beneficial owner of 354.358 shares of the company\u2019s     \ncommon stock, has advised us that he intends to present the following resolution: \nReport on Risks of Politicized De-banking Supporting Statement: Financial         \ninstitutions are essential pillars of the marketplace. Because of their unique and\npivotal role in America\u2019s economy, many federal and state laws already prohibit   \nthem from discriminating against customers. The UN Declaration of Human Rights    \nrecognizes that \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and    \nreligion.\u201d 1These are an important part of protecting every American\u2019s right to   \nfree speech and free exercise of religion. As shareholders of Bank of America, we \nbelieve it is essential for the company to provide financial services on an equal \nbasis without regard to factors such as race, color, religion, sex, national      \norigin, or social, political, or religious views. We are concerned with recent    \nevidence of religious and political discrimination against customers by companies \nin the financial services industry, as seen in recent examples 2and the 2022      \nStatement on Debanking and Free Speech. 3 The 2023 edition of the Viewpoint       \nDiversity Business lndex 4shows that many of the largest financial institutions   \ninclude vague and subjective grounds to deny service like \u201creputational risk,\u201d    \n\u201csocial risk,\u201d \u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cintolerance.\u201d These kinds of   \nterms allow financial institutions to deny or restrict service for arbitrary or   \ndiscriminatory reasons. As per the 2023 Index, Bank of America is no exception to \nsuch concerns: as per VDS\u2019 report, the Corporation\u2019s \u201cterms of service are        \nimprecise and unclear.\u201d Furthermore, as noted in the 1792 Exchange\u2019s 2023 report, \nBank of America \u201cfail[s] to protect against discrimination based on political     \naffiliation/views and/or religion.\u201d Bank of America received a High Risk rating in\nthe report, given 5its practice of \u201cterminate[ing] business with several          \ncustomers, especially ones with conservative viewpoints.\u201d When companies engage in\nthis kind of discrimination, they hinder the ability of Americans to access the   \nmarketplace and instead become de facto regulators and censors. This undermines   \nthe fundamental freedoms of our country and is an affront to the public trust.    \nPoliticized de-bankingcan also damage the company\u2019s reputation and ability to     \noperate in favorable regulatory environments. In April 2023, the religious        \nnonprofit Indigenous Advance Ministries was de-bankedwith little explanation other\nthan the nonprofit no longer aligned with Bank of America\u2019s risk tolerance        \npolicies. Indigenous Advance Ministries is advised by the highly successful pro-  \nreligious-freedomlitigation group Alliance Defending Freedom 6, and recently filed\na complaint with the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, concerned that Bank of  \nAmerica was engaging in targeted financial discrimination against the nonprofit.  \nResolved:Shareholders request the Board of Directors of Bank of America conduct an\nevaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and        \nexcluding proprietary information and disclosure of anything that would constitute\nan admission of pending litigation, evaluating how it oversees risks related to   \ndiscrimination against individuals based on their race, color, religion (including\nreligious views), sex, national origin, or political views, and whether such      \ndiscrimination may impact individuals\u2019 exercise of their constitutionally         \nprotected civil rights.                                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 5 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       We are guided by our core value of respecting every individual and         \n  \u2022    valuing our differences, and we apply that core value to our               \n       relationships with employees and customers.                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Our policies and practices are designed to prevent discrimination in       \n       employment and in the provision of our products and services.              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Board and its committees provide objective, independent oversight of   \n  \u2022    compliance with our policies on non-discrimination, including associated   \n       risk management practices.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    It is not our policy or practice to deny services on the basis of          \n       political viewpoint or religious affiliation.                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our shareholders, customers, and communities are well served by our        \n  \u2022    continuous and holistic pursuit of Responsible Growth that includes our    \n       commitment to nondiscrimination and continued engagement and disclosure    \n       of our progress on equality, diversity, and inclusion.                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                           \n  1  https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n     https://adflegal.org/press-release/bank-america-boots-charity-serving-impo\u2026  \n     https://www.newsweek.com/stop-troubling-trend                                \n  2  -politically-motivated-debanking-opinion-1787639;

That commitment is critical to how we drive           \nResponsible Growth by delivering for our teammates, clients, and shareholders and \nit is reflected in our policies and practices. Internally, this is core to being a\ngreat place to work, and our workforce reflects the communities in which we live  \nand serve. Externally, this is core to our client-driven approach, delivering     \nproducts and services that meet the diverse needs of our clients, and investing   \nour resources to support our communities and the issues affecting them. We firmly \nbelieve that as a financial institution it is our responsibility and part of our  \ndaily course of business to help make financial lives better. And we do so by     \nproviding products and services to our diverse customer base and treating each    \ncustomer with respect and dignity. Our policies and practices are designed to     \nprevent discrimination in employment and in the provision of our products and     \nservices.Our engagement with our employees, clients, vendors, and communities     \naround the world is guided by our commitment to fair, ethical, and responsible    \nbusiness practices, which is embodied in our values and reflected in our Human    \nRights Statement and our Code of Conduct. Our Human Rights Statement describes the\npolicies and standards we have implemented to respect human rights. As described  \nin the Statement, we actively seek to prevent discriminatory practices as it      \nrelates to our customers\u2019 access to credit financing and maintaining accessible   \nproducts and services designed to serve our customers\u2019 various needs. We also have\npolicies to protect our products and services against misuse, including in ways   \nthat may be connected to adverse human rights impacts. These policies include a   \ncustomer due diligence process, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the Modern Slavery Act, as well as anti-money      \nlaundering controls. Our Code of Conduct makes clear that the company does not    \ntolerate unlawful discrimination or harassment of any kind and that these         \nexpectations apply whenever employees are engaged in business on behalf of the    \ncompany. To further underscore our commitment to nondiscrimination and ethical    \nconduct in every aspect of our operations, we provide teammates at all levels with\nongoing training and educational opportunities on our nondiscrimination and       \nrelated policies. Violations of the Code of Conduct, including unlawful           \ndiscrimination against customers, teammates, or others, is dealt with promptly and\nmay constitute grounds for disciplinary action, including termination of          \nemployment and possible legal action. Our Board and its committees provide        \nobjective, independent oversight of our policies on non-discrimination,including  \nassociated risk management practices.Our Board and its committees play a key role \nin setting the \u201ctone at the top\u201d and holding management accountable for           \nmaintaining high ethical standards and effective policies and practices to protect\nour reputation, assets, and business. As part of this role, the Board\u2019s Audit     \nCommittee actively oversees compliance with our Code of Conduct and receives      \nreports from management on the Code\u2019s implementation, and the Audit Committee     \nprovides the full Board with regular reports on an array of compliance-related    \nissues. The Board receives reports from management on customer feedback, including\ncustomer complaints. The Board also reviews information on the company\u2019s impact in\nthe communities we serve. Another crucial aspect of the Board\u2019s role is its       \noversight of risk. Our Risk Framework is annually approved by the Enterprise Risk \nCommittee and the Board, and serves as the foundation for consistent and effective\nrisk management and outlines the seven key types of risk that our company faces,  \nincluding compliance risk, operational risk, and reputational risk. As part of the\nrisk management governance structure outlined in our Risk Framework, the Board and\nEnterprise Risk Committee also oversee management\u2019s identification, measurement,  \nmonitoring, and control of our risks, including conduct risk. This framework of   \nobjective, independent Board oversight of risk better enables us to serve our     \nclients, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and achieve our strategic  \nobjectives. It is not our policy or practice to deny services on the basis of     \npolitical viewpoint or religious affiliation.Contrary to the suggestion in this   \nproposal, the company does not make decisions regarding its client relationships  \non the basis of any client\u2019s political viewpoint, religious affiliation, or other \ndiscriminatory characteristics that would be inconsistent with our Human Rights   \nStatement. We consider a variety of factors when determining whether to commence  \nor terminate a client relationship. However, any such action must comply with     \napplicable law. As a registered financial holding company and bank holding        \ncompany, we are subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the     \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and our U.S. bank subsidiaries, \norganized as national banking associations, are subject to regulation,            \nsupervision, and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  \nand the Federal Reserve. Our shareholders, customers, and communities are well    \nserved by our continuous and holistic pursuit of Responsible Growth that includes \nour commitment to nondiscrimination and continued engagement and disclosure of our\nprogress on equality, diversity, and inclusion.Promoting nondiscrimination and    \nequality, diversity, and inclusion, both inside our company with employees and    \noutside our company in our communities, are critical components of Responsible    \nGrowth and our drive to grow in a sustainable manner. Our ongoing efforts in these\nareas, our continuous engagement with shareholders, employees, and external       \nstakeholders representing a diverse range of perspectives and thought, and our    \nBoard\u2019s oversight and leadership of our efforts, demonstrate our commitment to    \nunderstanding and improving our company\u2019s impacts on all stakeholders. Through    \nResponsible Growth, we are making meaningful progress for our customers,          \ncommunities, and teammates, through ongoing engagement and collaboration with     \nthird-party experts on civil rights, nondiscrimination, equality, diversity, and  \ninclusion. These ongoing engagements help drive progress and hold us accountable  \nfor our actions. In light of our commitment to respecting every individual and    \nvaluing our differences and to promoting nondiscrimination and inclusion in every \naspect of our operations, as embodied in our Code of Conduct, Human Rights        \nStatement, and our other policies and practices, the report requested by the      \nproposal is unnecessary and would not provide shareholders with meaningful        \nadditional information.                                                           \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 5).                         \n                                                      \n                              \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    99  \n                              \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nProposal 6: Shareholder proposal requesting report on lobbying alignment with Bank\nof America\u2019s climate goals Sada Geuss, c/o Trillium Asset Management, Two         \nFinancial Center, 60 South Street, Suite 1100, Boston, MA, 02111, and other co-   \nfilershave advised us that they intend to present the resolution below. The       \nproponent confirmed that she is the beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market \nvalue of the company\u2019s common stock but did not provide the number of shares      \nowned. Lobbying Misalignment with Bank of America\u2019s Goals WHEREAS:Climate change  \nposes a systemic risk, with estimated global GDP loss of 11-14%by midcentury under\ncurrent trajectories. 1The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council has         \nidentified climate change as an increasing threat to the financial system. 2We    \nbelieve lobbying and public policy action inconsistent with the Paris Agreement   \nmay present an increasingly pressing danger to companies. We applaud Bank of      \nAmerica\u2019s (BAC) commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. BAC acknowledged        \nachieving its net zero goal requires collective action, including by policymakers,\nand described itself as \u201csupportive of policies that will help accelerate the     \ntransition to a low-carboneconomy ... Independently, and working with trade       \nassociations and other collaborations, [we] advocate for more urgent action on    \nclimate change by the public and private sectors and promote policies that align  \nwith the role played by banks in helping to finance the transition to net zero.\u201d 3\nHowever, BAC risks reputational damage 4and may foster potential systemic risk by \nfunding organizations lobbying against climate legislation - contradicting its own\npublic statements and possibly undermining achievement of its net zero goal. BAC  \nis a member of industry associations opposing critical climate change policies,   \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, and the Bank     \nPolicy Institute. 5 BAC\u2019s current disclosures do not adequately inform investors  \nif or how BAC ensures its direct and indirect lobbying activities align with its  \nnet zero goal and the Paris Agreement. BAC \u201ccontinually evaluate[s] the overall   \nbenefit of our continued memberships\u201d 6and has engaged with the Chamber of        \nCommerce via membership in its Climate Solutions Working Group, but this does not \nrepresent a comprehensive, public review of BAC\u2019s memberships and policy          \npositions, including how BAC addresses misalignment with its net zero goal and the\nParis Agreement, clear lines of governance oversight, or an escalation plan for   \nnon-alignment. RESOLVED:Shareholders request that BAC\u2019s Board of Directors analyze\nand report to shareholders annually (at reasonable cost, omitting confidential and\nproprietary information) on whether and how it is aligning its lobbying and policy\ninfluence activities and positions, both direct and indirect (through trade       \nassociations, coalitions, alliances, and other organizations) with its public     \ncommitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, including the climate policy    \nactivities and positions analyzed, the criteria used to assess alignment, and the \ninvolvement of stakeholders, if any, in the analytical process. SUPPORTING        \nSTATEMENT:In evaluating the degree of alignment between its net zero goals and its\npolicy advocacy, which we believe good governance calls for, BAC should disclose  \nits lobbying actions regarding climate provisions of key international, federal,  \nand state legislation and regulation, and not rely on organizational statements   \nsupporting climate progress.

We continue to make progress toward our net zero goal, and our      \npublic policy engagement activities in support of our net zero goal are described \nin our Approach to Zero transition strategy and our 2023 Task Force for Climate-  \nRelatedFinancial Disclosures Report. 2Our public policy team is engaged with      \npolicymakers across the globe, often through participation in trade associations  \nas we already disclose, to help us understand and, where appropriate, work to     \ninfluence potential policy changes that could impact our company, clients, or     \ncommunities we serve, and accelerate the transition-related work underway in the  \nprivate sector. Independently, and working with trade associations and through    \nother collaborations, we promote policies that can help the balanced and just     \ntransition to net zero. To encourage policy action, we are collaborating with     \ntrade associations and other alliances and partnerships to educate our colleagues \non our policy positions and advocate for alignment with the goals we have set.    \nMoreover, it is important to emphasize that our membership in specific trade      \nassociations or other organizations does not mean that we endorse every position  \nor issue that these organizations may support, including those relating to        \nclimate-related matters. At the same time, we engage with trade associations to   \naddress many other issues that may impact our company, our clients, or the        \nmarkets/economies in which we operate. We often voice our differing view on       \nsignificant issues to such organizations and continually evaluate the overall     \nbenefit of our continued memberships to assess whether they remain aligned with   \nour commitment to Responsible Growth and continue to serve the overall best       \ninterests of our company and our shareholders. Our political activities and public\npolicy engagement are subject to comprehensive governance, including oversight    \nfrom our Board\u2019s Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee.As a     \nglobal financial services company, the company is committed to participation in   \nthe political process in a manner that is consistent with leading corporate       \ngovernance practices and in compliance with legal requirements. Our approach to   \npolitical involvement is guided by our Corporate Political Contributions Policy   \nStatement, which sets forth basic principles regarding our company\u2019s stance on    \npolitical contributions and activities, along with our other policies and         \nprocedures, including our Code of Conduct and Political Action Committee          \ngovernance documents. Our political activities are managed by our public policy   \nteam in partnership with our compliance group and legal counsel, and we regularly \nreview our participation in trade associations and other organizations as part of \nour public policy engagement process. Our Board\u2019s Corporate Governance, ESG, and  \nSustainability Committee oversees this participation and regularly receives       \ninformation on political contributions, major lobbying priorities, and principal  \ntrade association activities that relate to our public policy objectives. We      \nalready provide extensive disclosure about our federal lobbying activities,       \npolicies, and procedures regarding political activities and contributions, and    \ntrade association memberships.We already disclose our policies and procedures for \npolitical activities and contributions on our website.Under \u201cPolitical Activities\u201d\non our Investor Relations website, 3we disclose our aggregate annual federal      \nlobbying expenses and provide links to our prior-year federal quarterly lobbying  \nreports so that the public and our shareholders can easily access reports         \ndisclosing our corporate expenditures related to lobbying and the issues on which \nwe lobbied. In addition, our company discloses on our website our principal       \nmemberships in financial industry and certain other trade associations that       \nreceive more than $25,000 from us annually, and any contribution made to non-     \ncandidateorganizations such as organizations organized under Section 527 of the   \nInternal Revenue Code or groups organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal \nRevenue Code to the extent permitted by applicable law. As a reflection of our    \nrobust practices and policies governing our public policy engagement, our company \nholds a Tier 1 ranking in the 2023 CPA-ZicklinIndex of Corporate Political        \nDisclosure and Accountability published annually by the non-partisan,nonprofit    \nCenter for Political Accountability. For the eighth year in a row, our company was\nnamed a CPA-ZicklinTrendsetter for political disclosure and accountability\u2014a      \ndesignation awarded to only 20% of S&P 500 companies. In light of our existing    \ndisclosures related to both our net zero commitment and our political activities  \nand public policy engagement, our Board believes the costly report requested by   \nthe proposal is unnecessary and would not provide our shareholders with meaningful\nadditional information.                                                           \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 6).                         \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  1  Our Approach to Zero net zero transition strategy is available at            \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/approach-to-zero-20\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Our 2023 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report   \n  2  is available at                                                              \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/report-center/esg/2023/2\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  3  Available at                                                                 \n     https://investor.bankofamerica.com/corporate-governance/governance-library\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    101  \n                               \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nProposal 7: Shareholder proposal requesting disclosure of clean energy financing  \nratio The New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, One Centre Street, 8th Floor\nNorth, New York, NY 10007, the beneficial owner of 2,784,379 shares of the        \ncompany\u2019s common stock, and two co-filershave advised us that they intend to      \npresent the following resolution: Clean Energy Supply Financing Ratio Resolved    \nShareholders request that Bank of America (\u201cCompany\u201d) disclose annually its Clean \nEnergy Supply Financing Ratio (\u201cRatio\u201d), defined as its total financing through   \nequity and debt underwriting, and project finance, in low-carbonenergy supply as a\nproportion of that in fossil-fuel energy supply. The disclosure, prepared at      \nreasonable expense and excluding confidential information, shall describe the     \nCompany\u2019s methodology, including what it classifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil    \nfuel.\u201d Supporting Statement The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d)\nhas advised that greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach net    \nzero by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d), this requires \na rapid transition away from fossil fuels and a tripling in global annual clean   \nenergy investment by 2030. 1 Banks aligning their activities with their own       \nclimate goals are better prepared to manage the risks, including legal,           \nreputational and financial risks, associated with the global energy transition.   \nFurthermore, they can capitalize on profitable opportunities in clean energy and  \nposition themselves as leaders in a rapidly changing market. Since 2022, banks    \nhave reportedly earned more in lending and underwriting fees from clean energy    \nprojects than from oil, gas, and coal companies. 2 The Company has committed to   \nachieve net zero emissions for its financing activities before 2050 and announced \na $1 trillion by 2030 goal to \u201cmobilize capital to accelerate the environmental   \ntransition.\u201d 3 While this financing commitment may appear significant, investors  \nneed more information to assess it relative to the Company\u2019s financing of fossil  \nfuels, which totaled approximately $280 billion since 2016, ranking it as the     \nfourth largest financer of fossil fuels. 4 According to BloombergNEF\u2019s recent     \nreport, Financing the Transition: Energy Supply Investment and Bank Financing     \nActivity (\u201cBloombergNEF Report\u201d), 5the pace at which low-carbonenergy supply is   \nscaled up will dictate the rate at which fossil fuels are phased down.            \nSynthesizing the seven most frequently referenced 1.5C \u2013 aligned pathways (IEA;   \nNetwork for Greening the Financial System; IPCC), it concluded that, to achieve   \nnet zero emissions by 2050, the Ratio must reach a minimum of 4:1 by 2030, rise to\n6:1 in the 2030s and 10:1 thereafter. Bloomberg estimated the Company\u2019s 2021 Ratio\nat 1.1. Clean-energy-to-fossil-fuelfinancing ratios have emerged as a key metric  \nfor assessing progress in financing the clean energy transition. The IEA tracks   \none, 6and they have been recognized by the leading bank climate alliances in which\nthe Company participates, including the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero   \nand the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which advised that comparable indicators for   \n\u201creporting requirements could include \u2026a transition finance ratio.\u201d 7 At          \nmanagement\u2019s discretion,

          \nThird parties, including Bloomberg, have developed methodologies to calculate     \nenergy supply finance ratios and similar information for global banks and disclose\nthese publicly.As part of our commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, we are\ntransparent about our well-considered and pragmatic strategy for supporting the   \ntransition of our energy and power systems clients toward a low-carbonfuture, and \nwe publicly discuss our strategy and progress in many public disclosures. A key   \ncomponent of our strategy is to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion of sustainable  \nfinancing by 2030. Our goal is aligned with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable       \nDevelopment Goals, with $1 trillion being dedicated toward the environmental      \ntransition to address climate change and promote the circular economy, including  \nsolutions for renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, water and\nsanitation, recycling, sustainable agriculture, and carbon capture and            \nsequestration, and $500 billion dedicated toward inclusive social development by  \nadvancing community development, affordable housing, health care, education,      \nfinancial and digital inclusion, and access to basic services. Since our          \nannouncement of this goal in 2021, we have mobilized and deployed $560 billion in \nsustainable finance with more than $316 billion focused on the transition to a    \nsustainable, low-carbon economy. Given stakeholders\u2019 interest in bank financing,  \nthird parties such as Bloomberg have developed methodologies to calculate energy  \nsupply finance ratios and similar information for global banks and disclose these \npublicly. The report referenced in the proposal, BloombergNEF\u2019s Financing the     \nTransition: Energy Supply Investment and Bank Financing Activityalready discloses \nan estimated energy supply finance ratio for our company\u2014the very ratio that the  \nproposal asks us to disclose. As acknowledged in the 2023 BloombergNEF Report, the\ncompany reviewed portions of our own data and provided feedback to Bloomberg, and \nother banks had the same opportunity. Asking banks to calculate their own ratios  \ncould result in different data sources and methodologies and reduce comparability.\nIn light of the existing disclosure of an estimated energy supply finance ratio in\nthe 2023 BloombergNEF Report, we do not believe it is necessary to undertake the  \nindependent reporting requested in this proposal. Further, the proponent issued a \nnews release stating it has filed shareholder proposals with five other large     \nfinancial institutions that are identical to the proposal filed with the company. \nIf all participants in the Bloomberg survey also produced their own ratios as     \nrequested in the proposal, there would likely be much less uniformity in          \nmethodology and comparability among ratios, which would undermine the utility of  \nsuch disclosures. We are transparent about actions to set targets for financed    \nemissions in support of our commitment to achieving net zero GHG emissions before \n2050.Integral to our Approach to Zero strategy, which outlines our commitment to  \nhelping finance the transition to net zero GHG emissions and details our target   \nsetting methodology, are the emission reduction targets for financing activities. \nIn 2022, we announced targets for financed emissions in the auto manufacturing,   \nenergy, and power generation sectors. In 2023, the company set targets for        \nfinanced emissions in the aviation and cement sectors and announced plans to add  \nadditional 2030 Financing Activity Targets in 2024 and to initiate facilitated    \nemissions calculations for certain capital markets portfolios. Our 2023 TCFD      \nReport 1provides additional details about how we developed our 2030 Financing     \nActivity Targets, metrics related to our financing activities including absolute  \nemissions and economic intensity following the Partnership for Carbon Accounting  \nFinancials methodology, data related to our target metrics and information        \nregarding our financing exposure to target sectors. Our Approach to Zero strategy,\ntogether with our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRP Framework) \n2, articulate a comprehensive and pragmatic strategy for supporting the transition\nacross economic sectors, including clients in energy and power systems industries.\nAs discussed above, the ratio requested by the proponent is already available     \nthrough Bloomberg. Therefore, the company\u2019s preparation and production of the     \nrequested ratio is duplicative, unnecessary and would not add to the transparent  \ndisclosure about our company already available. We continue to drive client       \nengagement to assist clients in their transition to net zero, including through   \nthe development of products and services as well as investment in climate         \nsolutions.Achieving net zero GHG emissions associated with our financing activity \ninvolves key steps outlined in our Approach to Zero transition strategy, which    \ninclude assisting our clients and providing them with the advice and financial    \nsolutions necessary for them to make progress on their own low-carbonbusiness     \nmodels. To facilitate engagement with clients across the enterprise, our client   \nrelationship teams are well versed in how best to support clients on their own net\nzero transitions. We are developing innovative products that promote this         \ntransition, such as credit facilities that are structured to link pricing to a    \nclient\u2019s carbon reduction efforts, and financial solutions for new and emerging   \nclean energy technologies that will be critical to provide additional carbon      \nreduction beyond traditional renewable energy sources. In light of our existing   \ndisclosures and declared strategy, our commitment to financing the transition to  \nnet zero emissions, and existing third-party initiatives to provide consistent    \nmeasurements of global energy supply financing activity, our Board believes that  \nthe disclosure requested by the proposal would not be a productive use of time or \neffort and would not provide our shareholders with meaningful additional          \ninformation.                                                                      \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 7).                         \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n     Our 2023 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report   \n  1  is available at                                                              \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/report-center/esg/2023/2\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  2  Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework is available at           \n     https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/environmental-and-s\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    103  \n                               \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nProposal 8: Shareholder proposal requesting right to act by written consent       \nKenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, the beneficial owner \nof at least 500 shares of the company\u2019s common stock, has advised us that he      \nintends to present the following resolution: Shareholder Right to Act by Written  \nConsent - Proposal 8 Shareholders request that our board of directors take such   \nsteps as may be necessary to permit written consent by the shareholders entitled  \nto cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize an action\nat a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and  \nvoting. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for   \nwritten consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means\nshareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting \ncycle like the election of a new director. For instance, Bank of America executive\npay was rejected by 30% of shares in 2023. The 30% rejection was all the more     \nimportant because it takes much more BAC shareholder conviction to reject         \nexecutive pay, and thereby disregard the Board of Director\u2019s position, than to    \nsimply go along with the Board\u2019s position. Given the 30% rejection of BAC         \nexecutive pay in 2023 it seems that BAC could have a more qualified chair of the  \nexecutive pay committee than Ms. Monica Lozano. The most recent career highlight  \nof Ms. Lozano is 5-yearsat a non-profitthat does not even have a Wikipedia        \nlisting. Ms. Lozano also has excessive tenure of 18-yearson the Bank of America   \nBoard. As director tenure goes up director independence goes down. With Ms. Lozano\nchairing the executive pay committee at BAC the lack of director independence is  \nunsettling. A shareholder right to act by written consent could give BAC directors\nmore of an incentive to improve their performance and more of an incentive to keep\nunqualified directors off of important Board committees like the executive pay    \ncommittee.

Unlike \nmatters presented for a vote at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, shareholder action by    \nwritten consent may not require communication to all shareholders, and may deny   \nshareholders the ability to participate in major decisions affecting the company  \nand their interests. A shareholder seeking action by written consent may attempt  \nto solicit the fewest possible shareholders to take action, rather than seeking   \ninput from all shareholders, and may rely on consents obtained from some          \nshareholders before other shareholders have had the ability to evaluate a         \nproposal, express their views, and vote. Permitting shareholder action by written \nconsent also could create confusion and disruption, as multiple shareholders could\nsolicit written consents at any time on a wide range of issues, which may         \nduplicate or conflict with other proposals. In contrast, for a special or annual  \nmeeting of shareholders, all shareholders receive advance notice of the meeting   \nand have clearly established times during which they can evaluate the issues,     \nengage with the company and other shareholders, communicate their views, and vote.\nOur Bylaws provide shareholders owning 10% of our common shares with the          \nmeaningful ability to call a special meeting of shareholders, and shareholders    \nowning 3% of our common shares with the ability to nominate a candidate for       \nelection to our Board .One or more shareholders owning 10% or more of our         \noutstanding voting stock are entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders   \noutside of our annual meeting cycle. 1Shareholders\u2019 ability to use the special    \nmeeting process is not subject to any conditions beyond those that                \n                                                                                  \n     The ability for 10% of our shareholders to call a special meeting            \n     represents a significant right\u2014and one that is more shareholder-friendly     \n     than the right at most other S&P 500 companies. According to FactSet, of     \n     the approximately 350 S&P 500 companies that permit shareholders to call a   \n  1  special meeting, approximately 80% of those companies have a stock           \n     ownership threshold greater than 10%, with the most prevalent stock          \n     ownership threshold set at 25%. In addition, fewer than 4% of S&P 500        \n     companies provide for action by written consent together with proxy access   \n     and the ability of 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting.            \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  104    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                          \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nalso apply to a Board-called special meeting. A special meeting of shareholders   \nallows shareholders, the Board, and company management to hold a discussion about \nshareholder concerns and empowers all shareholders to participate collectively in \na single meeting and make an informed vote. This informed and collective process  \ndoes not occur in an action taken by written consent, which only requires a       \nmajority of shareholders to participate in the process. In addition, the company  \nwas one of the first to adopt a proxy access Bylaw provision. This provision      \nallows shareholders owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock, including  \ngroups of up to 20 shareholders who collectively own 3% or more of our outstanding\nstock, the right to nominate director candidates constituting up to 20% of our    \nBoard, and to solicit votes for those candidates using our proxy materials. The   \nability for shareholders owning 10% of our common shares to call a special meeting\nand the proxy access Bylaw provision each allow all, not just some, of our        \nshareholders to express their views and do so more readily than through action by \nwritten consent, which would require any proposed actions to be approved by       \nholders of at least a majority (or higher when required by Delaware law) of our   \noutstanding shares (versus votes cast).

Our Board       \nengages in year-round communications with shareholders, and throughout 2023 and   \nearly 2024, we held over 70 meetings with shareholders representing over 3.9      \nbillion shares of our outstanding common stock, with our Board\u2019s Lead Independent \nDirector and our Compensation and Human Capital Committee Chair participating in  \nover 40 of these meetings. At these meetings, our shareholders provided input on  \nmany topics of interest, including our corporate governance practices, executive  \ncompensation program, and climate initiatives. This engagement informs and        \ncontributes to enhancements that help us address the issues our shareholders tell \nus matter most to them. See more detailed information about our shareholder       \nengagement program on page 37 of this proxy statement.                            \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 8).                         \n                                                      \nProposal 9: Shareholder proposal requesting independent board chair John          \nChevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, the beneficial   \nowner of 100 shares of the company\u2019s common stock, has advised us that he intends \nto present the following resolution: Independent Board Chairman - Proposal 9      \nShareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and    \namend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate people hold   \nthe office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO as follows: Whenever         \npossible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board   \nhas the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an      \nIndependent Director to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman  \nof the Board.                                                                     \n                               \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    105  \n                               \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nThis policy could be phased in when there is a leadership transition. This        \nproposal topic won 52% support at Boeing and 54% support at Baxter International. \nBoeing then adopted this proposal topic in June 2020. The roles of Chairman and   \nCEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a    \nChairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company. A lead director\nis thus no substitute for an independent board chairman. With the current CEO     \nserving as Chair this means giving up a substantial check and balance safeguard   \nthat can only occur with an independent Board Chairman. A lead director cannot    \ncall a special shareholder meeting. A lead director can delegate many details of  \nhis lead director duties to management and then simply rubber-stamp it. Management\nhas not explained how shareholders can be sure of what goes on in regard to lead  \ndirector delegation. One sign that Bank of America management does not believe in \nshareholder input on this important topic is that BAC management gives its        \nshareholders extra \u201chelp\u201d to make sure shareholders vote the management approved  \nway. BAC management routinely spends shareholder money to publish a glossy        \nsimplified voting guide for dummies shortly before the annual meeting. How can    \nthere be any genuine shareholder engagement if management is routinely stacking   \nthe deck in its favor with an extra dose of the approved management way to vote?  \nThis proposal topic previously won 30% support from Bank of America shareholders  \nin spite of an extra edition of how management thinks shareholders should vote.   \nThere is clearly a need for a change because the BAC stock price was at $32 five  \nyears ago. The increased complexities of companies of more than $240 Billion in   \nmarket capitalization, like BAC, increasingly demand that 2 persons fill the 2    \nmost important jobs in the company\u2014CEO and Chairman. Please vote yes: Independent \nBoard Chairman - Proposal 9                                                       \n                                                                                  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 9 because:                         \n                                                                                  \n       Our shareholders have repeatedly affirmed that the Board should retain     \n  \u2022    the flexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership           \n       structure based on applicable circumstances and needs.                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Our current Board leadership structure and governance practices provide    \n       robust and effective independent Board oversight.                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    The Board regularly evaluates and reviews the Board\u2019s leadership           \n       structure, seeking and considering input from shareholders.                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       There is no conclusive evidence demonstrating that an independent Chair    \n  \u2022    ensures superior governance or performance, and Board flexibility to       \n       determine the optimal leadership structure is the norm at other large      \n       companies.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nOur shareholders have repeatedly affirmed that the Board should retain the        \nflexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership structure based on   \napplicable circumstances and needs.Our shareholders have voted on our Board\u2019s     \nleadership structure multiple times since 2015. At a special meeting in September \n2015 convened solely for shareholders to voice their opinion on this topic, over  \n62% of votes cast by our shareholders voted to ratify bylaws that grant our Board \nthe flexibility to determine its leadership structure, including appointing an    \nindependent Chair or appointing a Lead Independent Director when the Chair is not \nan independent director. At our 2017, 2018, and 2023 annual meetings, our         \nshareholders voted on proposals nearly identical to this proposal with over 67%,  \n69%, and 73%, respectively, of the votes cast voting against the proposals and in \nfavor of the Board retaining flexibility to determine the most effective          \nleadership structure based on applicable circumstances and needs. This flexibility\nallows the Board to respond to its changing circumstances and needs when          \ndetermining the most suitable Board leadership structure for the company and to   \ncontinue to protect and enhance long-term shareholder value. The Board does not   \nbelieve one singular, fixed Board leadership model is universally or permanently  \nappropriate in all circumstances. In deciding whether an independent Chair or a   \nLead Independent Director is right for the company at any particular time, the    \nBoard\u2019s determination should not be unthinking and mechanical. It should be       \ncontextual and tailored to the then-present needs and opportunities of the        \ncompany. The Board, in fulfilling its fiduciary duties, should not be prevented   \nfrom selecting the individual it believes is most qualified and best positioned to\nact as Chair. Our shareholders rely on the Board\u2019s independence, experience, and  \njudgment in exercising their fiduciary duties to protect and act in shareholders\u2019 \nbest interests. Adoption of this proposal would restrict the Board\u2019s ability to   \nutilize its experience and judgment and the ongoing input it receives from        \nshareholders to make well-informed decisions regarding the Board\u2019s leadership     \nstructure. Our current Board leadership structure and governance practices provide\nrobust and effective independent Board oversight.Our Board is committed to        \nobjective, independent Board leadership and views the provision of active,        \nobjective, and independent oversight as central to effective Board governance, to \nserving the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and to executing  \nour strategic objectives and creating long-term value. The Board believes that    \nindependent board oversight involves not only having a properly defined           \nindependent board leader, such as a strong Lead Independent Director when the     \nChair is the CEO, but also having robust governance structures that promote active\noversight.                                                                        \n                          \n  106    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                          \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nOur Board embraces multiple interlinked practices to provide that the Board, as a \nwhole, functions effectively and provides robust independent oversight. These     \ninclude: (1) regular reviews of our Board leadership structure and governance     \npractices, taking into account contemporaneous shareholder and stakeholder        \nperspectives; (2) a robust, well-defined, and transparent Lead Independent        \nDirector role that is filled when our Chair is not an independent director and    \nempowers the Lead Independent Director with extensive authority and               \nresponsibilities; (3) active leadership, involvement, and influence by the Lead   \nIndependent Director through regular executive sessions of our independent        \ndirectors without management, regular discussions with our CEO and the other      \nindependent directors between Board meetings, regular interaction with our primary\nbank regulators, and active engagement with shareholders; (4) a Board composed of \ndiverse, experienced, and skilled Board members, all of whom stand for election   \nannually and are independent aside from the CEO; (5) standing Board committees    \nthat are each chaired by an independent director and composed entirely of         \nindependent directors; and (6) comprehensive, multi-faceted Board and committee   \nself-evaluations complemented by thoughtful director succession practices. Please \nsee the \u201cIndependent board leadership\u201d section on pages 26 and 27 of this proxy   \nstatement for more information about our current Board leadership structure and   \ngovernance practices. We believe these practices, coupled with our Board\u2019s other  \ngovernance processes, provide for strong, independent Board leadership and        \neffective engagement with, and oversight of, management. The Board regularly      \nevaluates and reviews the Board\u2019s leadership structure, seeking and considering   \ninput from shareholders.The Board evaluates and reviews the Board\u2019s leadership    \nstructure at least annually to determine what, if any, changes are appropriate    \nbased on the Board\u2019s and company\u2019s then-existing circumstances and needs, and in  \nlight of input from shareholders and other stakeholders. Providing the Board with \nflexibility to make these leadership decisions empowers the Board to do what is in\nthe best interests of the company and our shareholders. If at any time the Board\u2019s\nreview of its leadership structure resulted in the conclusion that an independent \nChair is in the best interests of our shareholders based on the company\u2019s         \ncircumstances and needs at that time, the Board would appoint an independent Chair\nto address those needs and circumstances. The Board\u2019s leadership evaluation       \nprocess is described in more detail on page 26 of this proxy statement. Our Board \nand management also have a demonstrated record of engaging with our shareholders  \nand soliciting their input on important matters, including their views on Board   \nleadership. Since being named the Lead Independent Director successor at the end  \nof 2020, Mr. Nowell has participated in over 130 meetings with institutional      \nshareholders representing over 38% of our outstanding shares. Shareholder input is\nthen shared with our Board, its committees, and company management on a regular   \nbasis and informs and contributes to enhancements related to our corporate        \ngovernance practices, executive compensation program, and human capital,          \nenvironmental, and other sustainability initiatives. The Board\u2019s shareholder      \nengagement process is described in more detail on page 37 of this proxy statement.\nThe Board recognizes that certain shareholders prefer an independent Chair at all \ntimes, for all companies, and are therefore likely to support the proposal.       \nHowever, during our recent engagement meetings, far more shareholders have        \nexpressed their support for our Lead Independent Director and the Board\u2019s         \ncontinued flexibility to determine its leadership structure based on the company\u2019s\ncircumstances and needs at any given time. There is no conclusive evidence        \ndemonstrating that an independent Chair ensures superior governance or            \nperformance, and Board flexibility to determine the optimal leadership structure  \ncontinues to be the norm at other large companies .While the Board recognizes and \nrespects different points of view and philosophies about which leadership         \nstructure supports the best operational or governance results, existing empirical \ndata concerning the impact of board leadership on shareholder value do not        \nconclusively establish any correlation between the presence of an independent     \nchair and superior corporate governance or performance. In fact, most of the      \nfinancial institutions that failed in the spring of 2023 had independent board    \nchairs. Even as the general empirical evidence remains inconclusive, under the    \ncurrent Board leadership structure, the Board has continued to sharpen its focus  \non corporate governance and established leading governance and disclosure         \npractices (see \u201cCorporate governance\u201d beginning on page 25 of this proxy          \nstatement), and our company continues to execute on our long-term strategy and    \nfocus on Responsible Growth\u2014a strategy conceived under the vision of our current  \nChair and CEO and developed with the evaluation and unanimous support of the      \nBoard\u2019s independent directors\u2014to propel our company\u2019s operating and financial     \nperformance and deliver for our clients, employees, and the communities we        \nserve\u2014and for our shareholders. For example, we are one of only four companies    \nglobally that has reported over $15 billion in net income for nine years in a row \n(2015-2023, the full years coincident with the Board\u2019s adoption of its current    \nBoard leadership structure). During this nine-year period, our annual earnings    \nincreased 67% to $26.5 billion, our customer deposit levels grew $727 billion to  \n$1.9 trillion, our loans grew $151 billion to $1.1 trillion, and our Tier 1       \ncapital increased to $223 billion while book value per share grew by 48%, even    \nafter the company returned $158 billion in capital to shareholders over this time \nin common stock dividends and repurchases. The company\u2019s stock price nearly       \ndoubled during this time period.

SUPPORTING STATEMENT The Company\u2019s executive    \ncompensation jumped irregularly, irrationally, and unreasonably from 2021 to 2022:\nfrom 23,729,169 to 30,177,503 (+27.2%) for CEO, from 10,956,873 to 12,601,937     \n(+15.0%) for CFO, from 12,262,492 to 20,650,361 (+68.4%) for Regional Banking     \nPresident, from 12,669,214 to 20,660,643 (+63.1%) for Vice Chair, from 12,474,933 \nto 20,652,107 (+65.5%) for Chief Risk Officer (2023 Proxy Statement p.68). The CEO\npay ratio in 2022 was 258:1 (p.79). Furthermore, how different executive officers \ncould achieve the same incomes for the vastly different functions of the Regional \nBanking President, the Vice Chair and the Chief Risk Officer? The 1-yeartotal     \nshareholder return was -23.8%(p.3). America\u2019s ballooning executive compensation is\nnot sustainable for the economy, and there is no rational methodology to decide   \nthe executive compensation, particularly because there is no consideration of the \nCEO pay ratio. The CEO pay ratios of big Japanese and European companies are much \nless than of big American companies. The increase of disparity of income has a    \ndirect negative impact on American social instability. For example, one article   \n\u201c\u2018No defensible argument\u2019: Anger boils over at CEO pay\u201d from Politico.com         \n09/16/2023 stated: \u201cThe historic UAW strike puts an exclamation point on more than\na decade of efforts ... to narrow the pay gap between top executives and workers. \n... And between 1978 and 2021, executive compensation at large American companies \nincreased by more than 1,400 percent.\u201d Adam Smith said: \u201cWealth, as Mr Hobbes     \nsays, is power.\u201d America has a long history to check and balance power. The public\ngives the board the power to run the corporate business without organized unions  \nin big financial companies, without employee representation on board; and the     \nboard is nominated and elected without any competition (the number of candidates  \nis the same number of board seats). To increase the executive wealth              \n(compensation) irregularly, irrationally, and unreasonably is to abuse the power. \nShareholders in JPMorgan Chase & Co., Intel, Netflix and other big companies      \nrejected sky-highexecutive pay packages in 2022 and 2023. As a policy             \nrecommendation, the Company may refer to Aristotle\u2019s Politik\u00e1/Politics, in which  \nhe concluded that in a stable polis community, the disparity of wealth (land      \nownership) should not be more than 5 times. Human nature has not changed so       \ndramatically. The Company has the flexibility to reform the Compensation and Human\nCapital Committee to improve the executive compensation program, such as to       \ninclude the CEO pay ratio factor.                                                 \n                                                                                  \nOur Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d Proposal 10 because:                        \n                                                                                  \n       Our existing processes and procedures operate effectively to drive         \n  \u2022    Responsible Growth by recognizing and rewarding performance with           \n       competitive and fair pay for the work done at all levels of our company,   \n       making the policy change requested in this proposal unnecessary.           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Our executive compensation program effectively aligns executives\u2019 and      \n       shareholders\u2019 interests.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Input received from our shareholders through our comprehensive engagement  \n  \u2022    program directly informs the evaluation and evolution of our executive     \n       compensation program.                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee regularly reviews our         \n  \u2022    executive compensation program in the context of our pay-for-performance   \n       philosophy and commitment to deliver Responsible Growth.                   \n                                                                                  \n                          \n  108    BANK\u00a0OF\u00a0AMERICA  \n                          \n                                         \n  Proposals\u00a05\u201310:\u00a0Shareholder\u00a0proposals  \n                                         \nOur existing processes and procedures operate effectively to drive Responsible    \nGrowth by recognizing and rewarding performance with competitive and fair pay for \nthe work done at all levels of our company .Responsible Growth that is sustainable\nincludes being a great place to work. We drive Responsible Growth and our         \ncommitment to being a great place to work strategically and holistically. We pay  \nour teammates fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience, and how   \nthey perform, and we regularly benchmark against other companies both within and  \noutside our industry to help maintain competitive pay. We recognize performance   \nand share success at all levels of our company. Since 2017, we have awarded more  \nthan $4.8 billion in special compensation awards to teammates in recognition of   \ntheir contributions to our drive for Responsible Growth, with approximately 97% of\nemployees receiving an award in 2024. We also provide employees with access to    \nindustry-leading benefits that promote physical, emotional, and financial         \nwellness, and continue to evolve these benefits and programs to meet employees    \nwhere they are in their career and personal lives. We have made regular increases \nto our minimum rate of pay for hourly employees over the past several years and in\nOctober 2023 increased our minimum pay to $23 per hour, taking one step closer to \nour goal of increasing our minimum hourly wage to $25 by 2025. In addition, our   \n2023 median employee compensation, which is disclosed on page 85, has increased   \napproximately 43% since 2017, the first year for which this disclosure was        \nrequired. Moreover, we are committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain     \nrobust policies and practices that reinforce that commitment, including reviews   \nwith oversight from our Compensation and Human Capital Committee and senior       \nleaders. For over 17 years, we have conducted rigorous processes and analyses with\noutside experts to examine individual employee pay before year-endcompensation    \ndecisions, and we adjust compensation where appropriate to reinforce pay-for-     \nperformanceand equal pay for equal work. Our executive compensation program       \neffectively aligns executives\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests.Our compensation       \nphilosophy is to pay for performance over the long-term, as well as on an annual  \nbasis. As explained in our Compensation discussion and analysis beginning on page \n53, our executive officers are awarded equity compensation after the performance  \nyear to which those awards relate. However, SEC rules require those awards to be  \nreported as compensation for the year in which the awards are granted, which we   \nbelieve can at times obscure the alignment between our executive compensation     \npractices and corporate performance. Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis     \ndetails how our executive compensation program appropriately links compensation to\nour performance and properly aligns the interests of our executive officers with  \nthose of our shareholders. This alignment is implemented through a mix of salary, \nincentives, and benefits paid over time, as well as long-term equity-based awards,\nwhich further align executive officer and shareholder interests by linking a      \nsubstantial portion of compensation to the achievement of sustainable, long-term  \ncorporate performance and operational efficiency. Input received from our         \nshareholders through our comprehensive engagement program directly informs the    \nevaluation and evolution of our executive compensation program.As part of our     \nevaluation of our executive compensation program, our Compensation and Human      \nCapital Committee and senior leaders regularly solicit feedback from our          \nshareholders on our executive compensation program, human capital management, and \nother compensation-related matters. These discussions with shareholders provide   \nthe Committee with valuable insight and feedback that inform their pay evaluation \nand decision process. In 2023 and early 2024, we held over 70 engagement meetings \nwith shareholders representing over 3.9 billion shares of our outstanding common  \nstock, with our Board\u2019s Lead Independent Director and the Compensation and Human  \nCapital Committee Chair participating in over 40 of those meetings. During these  \nmeetings, shareholders provided valuable input on a range of executive            \ncompensation and human capital related matters; however, no shareholders raised   \nconcerns related to the CEO pay ratio or requested the adoption of a policy       \nsimilar to the proposal\u2019s request. In addition, we provide shareholders with an   \nannual opportunity to cast an advisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote. Shareholders again      \napproved our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote at our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders\u2014marking \nthe 15 thconsecutive year of \u201cSay on Pay\u201d approval. For more details, please      \nreview the Compensation discussion and analysis starting on page 53. Our          \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee regularly reviews our executive          \ncompensation program in light of our pay-for-performancephilosophy and commitment \nto deliver Responsible Growth.Each year, our Compensation and Human Capital       \nCommittee reviews our executive compensation program, including the compensation  \nand performance of our named executive officers.As part of its evaluation, the    \nCommittee reviews a range of factors, including governance considerations,        \ninternal performance and results, and company pay ratio information. When         \nreviewing the performance of our named executive officers, the Committee uses a   \nbalanced and disciplined approach to determine base salaries and variable         \ncompensation awards. At the start of each year, goals aligned to the tenets of    \nResponsible Growth are set for each executive officer and progress to meeting     \nthose goals, including both financial and non-financialresults, are tracked on    \nscorecards. The Committee\u2019s compensation decision process involves a robust review\nof company and line of business performance as well as individual performance for \neach named executive officer. The Committee also reviews market pay practices,    \nincluding market compensation benchmarks from our primary peers and leading       \ninternational financial institutions and global companies headquartered in the    \nU.S., as well as feedback from our independent control functions ( i.e., Corporate\nAudit, Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, Legal, and Risk). After taking these \nvarious inputs into consideration, the Committee determines the appropriate       \ncompensation for the named executive officers. Given the effectiveness of our     \nexisting processes and programs in providing appropriate, fair, and competitive   \ncompensation for all of our teammates and our Compensation and Human Capital      \nCommittee\u2019s ongoing evaluation of our executive compensation program, which is    \ninformed by robust engagement with our shareholders, we believe that the policy   \nchange requested by this proposal is unnecessary and not in the best interests of \nour shareholders.                                                                 \n                                                      \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d  \n  this proposal (Proposal 10).                        \n                                                      \n                               \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    109  \n                               \n                                \n  Voting\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0information  \n                                \nVoting, attending the annual meeting, and other information Voting Who may vote at\nthe annual meeting?

In addition,  \n       if you are a registered shareholder, you may vote by internet or phone no  \n  \u2022    later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on April\u00a023, 2024.                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Beneficial shareholders.

If a nominee does not receive the required votes    \n       for election at our annual meeting, our Board, with the assistance of our  \n       Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, will consider     \n       whether to accept the director\u2019s offer of resignation, which is required   \n       to be tendered under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Board will   \n       publicly disclose its decision regarding the resignation and the basis     \n       for its decision within 90 days after election results are certified.      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Other proposals. Approval of Proposals 2 through 10 requires the votes     \n       cast in favor of each such proposal to exceed the votes cast against the   \n  \u2022    proposal. Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not treated as  \n       votes cast and are not counted in determining the outcome of any of these  \n       proposals.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                               \n  2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0STATEMENT    111  \n                               \n                                \n  Voting\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0information  \n                                \nWhat other information do I need to know?

Attending the annual meeting Why is this year\u2019s annual meeting     \nbeing held in a virtual-only format?

However, we believe that certain \nnon-GAAP financial measures provide additional clarity in understanding our       \nresults of operations and trends as follows:                                      \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022    Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net income applicable to       \n       common shareholders divided by average diluted common shares.              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Certain results excluding debit valuation adjustment (DVA) losses provide  \n  \u2022    additional information to assess the underlying operational performance    \n       and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of             \n       period-to-period operating performance.                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Certain ratios that utilize tangible equity present measures of those      \n       assets that can generate income. Return on average tangible common         \n       shareholders\u2019 equity measures our net income applicable to common          \n       shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders\u2019      \n  \u2022    equity. Tangible book value per common share represents ending tangible    \n       common shareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.   \n       These measures are used to evaluate the company\u2019s use of equity. In        \n       addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use        \n       return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to         \n       support our overall growth goals.                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   \n       (FDIC) imposed a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit       \n       Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors of      \n       Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures.     \n       Accordingly, the company recorded pretax noninterest expense of $2.1B in   \n       4Q23 for its estimated assessment amount. Additionally, the company        \n       recorded a net pretax charge of $1.6B in 4Q23 to noninterest income        \n  \u2022    related to interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain loans   \n       that are indexed to the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY)       \n       following the 4Q23 announcement that BSBY will permanently cease           \n       effective November 15, 2024. The company believes the use of non-GAAP      \n       financial measures adjusting for the impact of the FDIC and BSBY charges   \n       provides additional information for evaluating its results of operations   \n       and comparing its operational performance between periods by excluding     \n       these impacts that may not be reflective of its underlying operating       \n       performance.                                                               \n                                                                                  \nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an        \nalternative for, our company\u2019s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. \nFor additional information about non-GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental    \nFinancial Data in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations on page 29 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed \nwith the SEC on February 20, 2024.

The Plan also enables the Company to attract and retain   \npersons of exceptional ability to serve as Non-EmployeeDirectors and to further   \nalign the interests of Non-EmployeeDirectors and stockholders in enhancing the    \nvalue of the Company\u2019s Shares.

For purposes of this Plan, a transfer of a \nParticipant\u2019s employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or between         \nSubsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment.

Change in Control    \n13.1 Treatment of Outstanding Awards.Unless otherwise specifically prohibited     \nunder applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing           \ngovernmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee may, in its \nsole discretion, at the time an Award is made hereunder or at any time prior to,  \ncoincident with or after the time of a Change in Control take any one or more of  \nthe following actions which shall apply only upon the occurrence of a Change in   \nControl or, if later, upon the action being taken: (a) provide for the            \nacceleration of any time periods, or the waiver of any other conditions, relating \nto the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an Award so that any Award to\na Participant whose employment has been terminated as a result of a Change in     \nControl may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a date \nfixed by the Committee, and in connection therewith the Committee may (i) provide \nfor an extended period to exercise Options (not to exceed the original Option     \nterm) and (ii) determine the level of attainment of any applicable performance    \ngoals; (b) provide for the purchase of any Awards from a Participant whose        \nemployment has been terminated as a result of a Change in Control, upon the       \nParticipant\u2019s request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have  \nbeen obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such  \nAward been currently exercisable or payable; or (c) cause the Awards then         \noutstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving  \ncorporation in such Change in Control. For purposes of sub-paragraphs(a) and (b)  \nabove, any Participant whose employment is either (i) terminated by the Company   \nother than for \u201ccause,\u201d or (ii) terminated by the Participant for \u201cgood reason\u201d   \n(each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), in either case upon, or on or\nprior to the second anniversary of, a Change in Control, shall be deemed to have  \nbeen terminated as a result of the Change in Control. 13.2 Limitation on Change-  \nin-ControlBenefits. It is the intention of the Company and the Participants to    \nreduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder if the     \naggregate Net After Tax Receipts (as defined below) to the Participant would      \nthereby be increased, as a result of the application of the excise tax provisions \nof Section 4999 of the Code. Accordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary   \nnotwithstanding, in the event that the certified public accountants regularly     \nemployed by the Company immediately prior to any \u201cchange\u201d described below (the    \n\u201cAccounting Firm\u201d) shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below)\nwould subject the Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall     \ndetermine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a \u201cReduced \nAmount\u201d (as defined below). If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a     \nReduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount in \naccordance with the provisions of Section 13.2(b) below. (a) For purposes of this \nSection 13.2(a): (i) A \u201cPayment\u201d shall mean any payment or distribution in the    \nnature of compensation to or for the benefit of a Participant who is a            \n\u201cdisqualified individual\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and   \nwhich is contingent on a \u201cchange\u201d described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the    \nCode with respect to the Company, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or\notherwise; (ii) \u201cPlan Payment\u201d shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to   \nthis Plan (disregarding this Section 13.2); (iii) \u201cNet After Tax Receipt\u201d shall   \nmean the Present Value of a Payment, net of all taxes imposed on the Participant  \nwith respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code, determined by applying\nthe highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which applied to the        \nParticipant\u2019s Federal taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year;  \n(iv) \u201cPresent Value\u201d shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section  \n280G(d)(4) of the Code; and (v) \u201cReduced Amount\u201d shall mean the smallest aggregate\namount of Payments which (A) is less than the sum of all Payments and (B) results \nin aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are equal to or greater than the Net    \nAfter Tax Receipts which would result if all Payments were paid to or for the     \nbenefit of the Participant.                                                       \n                                \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT    B-11  \n                                \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \n(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to\nthe Reduced Amount, the Committee shall promptly give the Participant notice to   \nthat effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. The Company shall     \nreduce or eliminate the Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of \nthe Payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating    \ncash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits  \nwhich are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination, all as          \ndetermined by the Accounting Firm. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm \nunder this Section 13.2 shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and \nshall be made within sixty (60) days immediately following the event constituting \nthe \u201cchange\u201d referred to above. As promptly as practicable following such         \ndetermination, the Company shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the      \nParticipant such Payments as are then due to the Participant under this Plan. (c) \nAt the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is  \npossible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for \nthe benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so\npaid or distributed (\u201cOverpayment\u201d) or that additional amounts which will have not\nbeen paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant  \npursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed (\u201cUnderpayment\u201d), in \neach case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the\nevent that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by\nthe Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant which the     \nAccounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling         \nprecedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been \nmade, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the       \nbenefit of the Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio  \nto the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the Company together with \ninterest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the \nCode; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and  \nno amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and to the extent \n(i) such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the  \nParticipant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or     \ngenerate a refund of such taxes or (ii) the Participant is subject to the         \nprohibition on personal loans under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other  \nsubstantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such     \nUnderpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the   \nParticipant together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in \nSection 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 13.3 Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of \nChange-in-ControlProvisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or  \nany Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article 13 may not be       \nterminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change in Control to   \naffect adversely any Award theretofore granted under the Plan without the prior   \nwritten consent of the Participant with respect to said Participant\u2019s outstanding \nAwards; provided, however, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the     \nCommittee, may terminate, amend, or modify this Article 13 at any time and from   \ntime to time prior to the date of a Change in Control. Article 14. Amendment,     \nModification, and Termination 14.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. The  \nBoard may at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate   \nthe Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that an amendment to the Plan may\nbe conditioned on the approval of the stockholders of the Company if and to the   \nextent the Board determines that stockholder approval is necessary or appropriate.\n14.2 Awards Previously Granted. No termination, amendment, or modification of the \nPlan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under\nthe Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award. 14.3 \nNo Repricing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the repricing \nof Options or SARs is prohibited without prior approval of the Company\u2019s          \nstockholders. For this purpose, a \u201crepricing\u201d means any of the following (or any  \nother action that has the same effect as any of the following): (A) changing the  \nterms of an Option or SAR to lower its Option Price or grant price; (B) any other \naction that is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally accepted accounting       \nprinciples; and (C) repurchasing for cash or canceling an Option or SAR at a time \nwhen its Option Price or grant price is greater than the Fair Market Value of the \nunderlying Shares in exchange for another Award, unless the cancellation and      \nexchange occurs in connection with a change in capitalization or similar change   \nunder Section 4.7 above. Such cancellation and exchange would be considered a     \n\u201crepricing\u201d regardless of whether it is treated as a \u201crepricing\u201d under generally  \naccepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the   \npart of the Participant. Article 15. Withholding 15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company\nshall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant\nto remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, local,   \nforeign or other taxes (including the Participant\u2019s FICA or other applicable      \nsocial tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable \nevent arising as a result of this Plan. 15.2 Share Withholding. The Company may   \ncause any tax withholding obligation described in Section 15.1 to be satisfied by \nthe Company withholding Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is  \nto be determined equal to the required tax withholding imposed on the transaction \n(not to exceed maximum statutory rates). In the alternative, the Company may      \npermit Participants to elect to satisfy the tax withholding obligation, in whole  \nor in part, by either (a) having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market \nValue on the date the tax is to                                                   \n                           \n  B-12    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \nbe determined equal to the required tax withholding imposed on the transaction    \n(not to exceed maximum statutory rates) or (b) tendering previously acquired      \nShares having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the required tax withholding\nimposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates). All such      \nelections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and   \nshall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its    \nsole discretion, deems appropriate. Article 16. Indemnification Provisions for the\nindemnification of officers and directors of the Company in connection with the   \nadministration of the Plan shall be as set forth in the Company\u2019s Certificate of  \nIncorporation and Bylaws as in effect from time to time. Article 17. Successors   \nAll obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted      \nhereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence \nof such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger,         \nconsolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or   \nassets of the Company. Article 18. Legal Construction 18.1 Gender and Number.     \nExcept where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein   \nalso shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the    \nsingular shall include the plural. 18.2 Severability. In the event any provision  \nof the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or    \ninvalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be\nconstrued and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been        \nincluded. 18.3 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of    \nShares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and         \nregulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national       \nsecurities exchanges as may be required. 18.4 Securities Law Compliance. With     \nrespect to Insiders, transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all \napplicable conditions of Rule 16b-3or its successors under the Exchange Act. To   \nthe extent any provision of the plan or action by the Committee fails to so       \ncomply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and      \ndeemed advisable by the Committee. 18.5 No Conflict. Unless otherwise provided for\nby an Award Agreement, in the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan \nand the terms of an Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. 18.6    \nGoverning Law. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all      \nagreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the   \nlaws of the State of Delaware. 18.7 Compliance With Code Section 409A. The Plan is\nintended to comply with Code Section 409A, to the extent applicable.              \nNotwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall be      \ninterpreted, operated and administered consistent with this intent. In that       \nregard, and notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company\nreserves the right to amend the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, by      \naction of the Committee, without the consent of any affected Participant, to the  \nextent deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of maintaining compliance with\nCode Section 409A.

Non-EmployeeDirectors 19.1 Restricted Stock Awards.\nSubject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Board, at any time and from  \ntime to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Non-EmployeeDirectors in    \nsuch amounts as the Board shall determine. Notwithstanding the definition of      \n\u201cParticipant\u201d provided in Article 2 above, upon receipt of a grant of Shares of   \nRestricted Stock, a Non-EmployeeDirector shall be considered a Participant in the \nPlan. Each grant of Shares of Restricted Stock to a Non-EmployeeDirector shall be \nevidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period or Periods of       \nRestriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted, and such other     \nprovisions as the Board shall determine. 19.2 Administration. The Board shall be  \nresponsible for administering any grants of Restricted Stock to Non-              \nEmployeeDirectors and shall have all of the powers necessary to enable it to      \nproperly carry out its duties hereunder. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the  \nBoard shall have the power to construe and interpret the Plan and to determine all\nquestions that shall arise thereunder with respect to grants of Restricted Stock  \nto Non-EmployeeDirectors. The Board shall have such other and further specified   \nduties, powers, authority and discretion as are elsewhere in the Plan either      \nexpressly or by necessary implication conferred upon it. The Board may appoint    \nsuch agents as it may deem necessary for the effective performance of its duties, \nand may delegate to such agents such powers and duties as the Board may deem      \nexpedient or appropriate that are not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan and\nthis Article 19. The decision of the Board upon all matters within the scope of   \nauthority shall be final and conclusive on all persons, except to the extent      \notherwise provided by law.                                                        \n                                \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT    B-13  \n                                \n                                                    \n  Appendix B: Amended and Restated Bank of America  \n  Corporation Equity Plan                           \n                                                    \n19.3 Vesting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, Shares of\nRestricted Stock granted to Non-EmployeeDirectors shall not become vested until   \nthe first anniversary of the applicable date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of\nthe next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company) (the \u201c Non-           \nEmployeeDirector Vesting Date\u201d), provided that if the Non-EmployeeDirector Vesting\nDate occurs less than 50 weeks after the applicable date of grant, it shall count \nagainst the 5% exception pool to the minimum vesting requirements set forth in    \nSection 3.4. If the Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-EmployeeDirector\nbefore the Non-EmployeeDirector Vesting Date due to the Non-EmployeeDirector\u2019s    \ndeath, or if there is a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date, then the     \nShares shall become fully vested as of the date of such death or Change in        \nControl, as applicable. If the Non-EmployeeDirector ceases to serve as a Non-     \nEmployeeDirector at any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of\nthe Vesting Date or a Change in Control, then the Shares shall become vested pro  \nrata (based on the number of days between the grant date of the Shares of         \nRestricted Stock, or in the case of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a newly \nappointed Non-EmployeeDirector, the date of commencement of services, and the date\nof cessation of services divided by (a) 365 days for grants made at an annual     \nstockholders meeting or (b) the number of days from the date of commencement of   \nservices until the next annual stockholders meeting for grants made to a newly    \nappointed Non-EmployeeDirector), and to the extent the Shares are not thereby     \nvested they shall be forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services. A    \nNon-EmployeeDirector may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Shares of \nRestricted Stock until they become vested; however, the Non-EmployeeDirector shall\nhave the right to receive dividends with respect to the Shares, subject to the    \nterms and conditions of Section 8.7, and to vote the Shares prior to vesting. If a\nNon-EmployeeDirector has elected to defer any Shares of Restricted Stock pursuant \nto the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (or any other similar   \nplan in which the Non-EmployeeDirector participates, including any successor or   \nreplacement plan) (a \u201c Deferral Plan\u201d), then (i) such Shares shall not be issued  \nunder this Plan, (ii) the Non-EmployeeDirector shall be credited with \u201cStock      \nUnits\u201d to be paid in cash when and as provided for under the Deferral Plan, and   \n(iii) the vesting provisions set forth above shall apply to any such Shares that  \nare deferred as Stock Units under the Deferral Plan. 19.4 No Other Awards. For    \npurposes of clarity, Non-EmployeeDirectors may not receive any other form of Award\ndescribed in this Plan, other than grants of Shares of Restricted Stock.          \n                           \n  B-14    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                           \nTHIS IS A VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM.
