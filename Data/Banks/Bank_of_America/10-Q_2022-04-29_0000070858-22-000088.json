In addition, multiple\njurisdictions have implemented various\neconomic sanctions on select Russian\ngovernment and military leaders,\nfinancial institutions, business leaders\nand the Central Bank of Russia. The\ngovernment of Russia has also\nimplemented economic sanctions on\ncertain non-Russian institutions and\nprevented outflows of selected\ncurrencies from Russia.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, our direct net\ncountry exposure to Russia was $759\nmillion, which primarily consisted of\noutstanding loans and leases totaling\n$679 million. All of our loans to\nRussian counterparties have been\ndowngraded and reported as reservable\ncriticized exposure, with their expected\ncredit losses incorporated into our\nestimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses. At March 31, 2022, our net\ncountry exposure to Ukraine was not\nsignificant. For more information on our\nRussian exposure, see Credit Risk\nManagement on page 25.\n\nWhile the Corporation\u2019s direct exposure\nto Russia is limited, the potential\nduration and impact of the\nRussia/Ukraine conflict and sanctions\nregime, including the impact of future\nsanctions, on global markets,\ninstitutions and macroeconomic\nconditions generally, as well as other\nfuture possible geopolitical\nconsequences arising from the current\nconflict, remain uncertain. Episodes of\neconomic and market volatility and\npressure on supply chains and inflation\nmay continue to occur and could worsen\nif the conflict persists or increases in\nseverity. As a result, the Corporation's\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial position could be adversely\naffected by any of these factors\ndirectly or indirectly arising from the\nRussia/Ukraine conflict.

The remaining USD LIBOR settings\n(i.e., overnight, one month, three\nmonth, six month and 12 month) will\ncease or become non-representative\nimmediately after June 30, 2023. The\nCorporation continues to execute its\nenterprise-wide transition program with\nrespect to Interbank Offered Rates. The\nCorporation has ceased entering into new\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate, subject to certain\nexceptions permitted under the\nsupervisory guidance issued by the\nFederal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC). The Corporation also\ncontinues to monitor a variety of market\nscenarios as part of its transition\nefforts, including risks associated with\ninsufficient preparation by individual\nmarket participants or the overall\nmarket ecosystem, ability of market\nparticipants to transition away from\nimpacted benchmarks, and access and\ndemand by clients and market\nparticipants to liquidity in certain\nproducts, including LIBOR products. As\npreviously disclosed, the Corporation\nhas remediated a significant majority of\nits notional contractual exposure to\nLIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR\nsettings ceasing or becoming non-\nrepresentative immediately after June\n30, 2023 (i.e., updated to include\nfallback provisions to alternative\nreference rates (ARRs), e.g., the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate for USD\nLIBOR, based on market-driven protocols,\nregulatory guidance, and industry-\nrecommended fallback provisions and\nrelated mechanisms). The remaining non-\nremediated USD LIBOR exposure, a\nmajority of which is made up of\nderivatives and commercial loans,\nrepresents a small minority of\noutstanding USD LIBOR notional\ncontractual exposure of the Corporation\nand will require active dialogue with\nclients to modify the contracts. For any\nresidual exposures after June 2023 that\ncontinue to have no fallback provisions,\nthe Corporation is assessing and\nplanning to leverage relevant\ncontractual and statutory solutions,\nincluding the Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at\nthe federal level in the U.S., and other\nrelevant legislation, to transition such\nexposure to ARRs.

The decrease in\nnet income was primarily due to an\nincrease in the provision for credit\nlosses and lower noninterest income,\npartially offset by higher net interest\nincome and lower noninterest expense.\nTotal assets increased $68.7 billion\nfrom December 31, 2021 to $3.2 trillion\nprimarily due to higher trading account\nassets and federal funds sold and\nsecurities borrowed under agreements to\nresell to support Global Markets client\nactivity, as well as loan growth.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America4                                                                \n                                                                                  \nTotal liabilities increased $72.2\nbillion from December 31, 2021 to $3.0\ntrillion primarily driven by an increase\nin federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned under agreements to\nrepurchase, accrued expenses and other\nliabilities and trading account\nliabilities due to increased activity in\nGlobal Markets . Shareholders\u2019 equity\ndecreased $3.4 billion from December 31,\n2021 primarily due to market value\ndecreases on derivatives and debt\nsecurities and returns of capital to\nshareholders through common stock\nrepurchases and common and preferred\nstock dividends, partially offset by net\nincome and the issuance of preferred\nstock. Net Interest Income Net interest\nincome increased $1.4 billion to $11.6\nbillion for the three months ended March\n31, 2022 compared to the same period in\n2021. Net interest yield on a fully\ntaxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased\n1 basis point (bp) to 1.69 percent. The\nincrease in net interest income was\nprimarily driven by the deployment of\ncash from deposit inflows into debt\nsecurities, loan growth and lower\npremium amortization, partially offset\nby a decrease in the acceleration of net\ncapitalized loan fees due to Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP) loan\nforgiveness.

The following\nhighlights the significant changes. \u25cf\nInvestment and brokerage services\nincreased $229 million primarily driven\nby the impacts of higher market\nvaluations and assets under management\n(AUM) flows, partially offset by\ndeclines in AUM pricing. \u25cf Investment\nbanking fees decreased $789 million\nprimarily driven by lower equity\nissuance and debt issuance fees,\npartially offset by higher advisory\nfees. \u25cf Market making and similar\nactivities decreased $291 million\nprimarily driven by a weaker performance\nin Fixed Income, Currencies and\nCommodities (FICC). The decrease was due\nto gains in commodities in the prior-\nyear period for a weather-related event\nand a weaker trading environment for\ncredit products in the current-year\nperiod, partially offset by improved\nperformance across macro products,\nincreased client activity and a strong\ntrading performance in Equity\nderivatives. \u25cf Other income decreased\n$126 million primarily due to certain\nvaluation adjustments.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses The\nprovision for credit losses increased\n$1.9 billion to $30 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022\ncompared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in\nthe same period in 2021.

Absent the ESG tax\ncredits, the effective tax rates would\nhave been approximately 24 percent and\n23 percent, respectively. Supplemental\nFinancial Data Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures In this Form 10-Q, we present\ncertain non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures exclude\ncertain items or otherwise include\ncomponents that differ from the most\ndirectly comparable measures calculated\nin accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are provided as\nadditional useful information to assess\nour financial condition, results of\noperations (including period-to-period\noperating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as a\nsubstitute\n                                                                                  \n  5Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nfor GAAP financial measures and may not\nbe defined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 43.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

For more\ninformation about Consumer Banking , see\nBusiness Segment Operations in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. Consumer Banking Results\nNet income for Consumer Banking\nincreased $294 million to $3.0 billion\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2022 compared to the same period in 2021\ndue to higher revenue and lower\nnoninterest expense, partially offset by\na lower benefit in the provision for\ncredit losses. Net interest income\nincreased $760 million to $6.7 billion\nprimarily due to the benefit of higher\ndeposit balances and the allocation of\nasset and liability management (ALM)\nresults, partially offset by a decrease\nin the acceleration of net capitalized\nloan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness.\nNoninterest income decreased $16 million\nto $2.1 billion primarily driven by\nchanges to overdraft services, lower\nmortgage banking income, the allocation\nof ALM results and lower card income,\npartially offset by higher other service\ncharges due to increased client\nactivity. The benefit in the provision\nfor credit losses decreased $565 million\nto $52 million primarily due to the\nimpact of the improved macroeconomic\noutlook in the prior-year period.\nNoninterest expense decreased $210\nmillion to $4.9 billion primarily driven\nby an impairment charge for real estate\nrationalization in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by continued\ninvestments for business growth and\nincreased client activity. The return on\naverage allocated capital was 30\npercent, up from 28 percent, driven by\nhigher net income, partially offset by\nan increase in allocated capital. For\nmore information on capital allocated to\nthe business segments, see Business\nSegment Operations on page 9. Deposits\nNet income for Deposits increased $741\nmillion to $1.4 billion due to higher\nrevenue and lower noninterest expense.\nNet interest income increased $774\nmillion to $4.1 billion primarily due to\nthe allocation of ALM results and the\nbenefit of higher\n\ndeposit balances. Noninterest income\nincreased $5 million to $903 million\nprimarily driven by higher other service\ncharges due to increased client activity\nand investment and brokerage fees,\nlargely offset by changes to overdraft\nservices and the allocation of ALM\nresults. Noninterest expense decreased\n$201 million to $3.0 billion primarily\ndriven by an impairment charge for real\nestate rationalization in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by continued\ninvestments for business growth and\nincreased client activity. Average\ndeposits increased $132.9 billion to\n$1.1 trillion primarily due to net\ninflows of $79.1 billion in checking and\n$51.1 billion in money market savings\nlargely driven by strong organic growth.\nThe table below provides key performance\nindicators for Deposits.

For more\ninformation on net DVA, see Supplemental\nFinancial Data on page 5.\n\nNet income for Global Markets decreased\n$459 million to $1.6 billion for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022\ncompared to the same period in 2021. Net\nDVA gains were $69 million compared to\nlosses of $2 million in 2021. Excluding\nnet DVA, net income decreased $513\nmillion to $1.5 billion. These decreases\nwere primarily driven by lower revenue,\npartially offset by lower noninterest\nexpense.\n\nRevenue decreased $906 million to $5.3\nbillion primarily driven by lower\ninvestment banking fees and sales and\ntrading revenue. Sales and trading\nrevenue decreased $359 million, and\nexcluding net DVA, decreased $430\nmillion. These decreases were driven by\nlower revenue in FICC, partially offset\nby higher revenue in Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $310\nmillion to 3.1 billion primarily driven\nby the realignment of a liquidating\nbusiness activity from Global Markets to\nAll Other in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nIn addition, the prior-year period\nincluded an acceleration of expenses\nfrom incentive compensation award\nchanges.\n\nAverage total assets increased $135.5\nbillion to $858.7 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 compared to\nsame period in 2021 driven by higher\nlevels of inventory and loan growth in\nFICC as well as higher client balances\nin Equities. Period-end total assets\nincreased $135.5 billion from December\n31, 2021 to $883.3 billion driven by\nhigher levels of inventory in FICC and\nincreased hedging of client activity\nwith stock positions relative to\nderivatives in Equities.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 15 percent, down from 22 percent,\nreflecting lower net income and an\nincrease in allocated capital.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the\nBoard.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common set\nof measures for senior management and\nthe Board to clearly indicate the level\nof risk we are willing to take in\nalignment with our strategic and capital\nplans and ensure that the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile remains aligned with our\nrisk appetite. Our risk appetite is\nformally articulated in the Risk\nAppetite Statement, which includes both\nqualitative components and quantitative\nlimits that are reviewed and approved by\nthe Board at least annually.\n\nFor more information about the\nCorporation\u2019s risks related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic), see\nItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Coronavirus\nDisease of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. These pandemic-\nrelated risks are being managed within\nour Risk Framework and supporting risk\nmanagement programs.\n\nFor more information on our Risk\nFramework, our risk management\nactivities and the key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation, see the\nManaging Risk section in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning. For\nmore information, including related\nregulatory requirements, see\n\nCapital Management in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nCCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to\nsubmit a capital plan and planned\ncapital actions on an annual basis,\nconsistent with the rules governing the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the\nresults of our 2021 CCAR capital plan\nand related supervisory stress tests, we\nare subject to a 2.5 percent stress\ncapital buffer (SCB) from October 1,\n2021 through September 30, 2022. Our\nCommon equity tier 1 (CET1) capital\nratio under the Standardized approach\nmust remain above 9.5 percent during\nthis period in order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. In\nApril 2022, we submitted our 2022 CCAR\ncapital plan and related supervisory\nstress tests. The Federal Reserve will\ndisclose CCAR capital plan supervisory\nstress test results by June 30, 2022.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board renewed the\nCorporation\u2019s $25 billion common stock\nrepurchase program previously announced\nin April 2021. The Board\u2019s authorization\nreplaced the previous program. As with\nthe April authorization, the Board also\nauthorized common stock repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s\nauthorizations, during the first quarter\nof 2022, we repurchased $2.6 billion of\ncommon stock, including repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. The Corporation's\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nalso subject to the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nand its primary affiliated banking\nentity, BANA, are Advanced approaches\ninstitutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based\ncapital ratios and risk-weighted assets\n(RWA) under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The approach that\nyields the lower ratio is used to assess\ncapital adequacy, including under the\nPCA framework. As of March 31, 2022, the\nCET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital\nratios for the Corporation were lower\nunder the Standardized approach.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. The Corporation's CET1\ncapital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5\npercent under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024 unless its\nsurcharge calculated as of December 31,\n2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.\n\nThe current SCB of 2.5 percent, which\nremains effective from October 1, 2021\nthrough September 30, 2022, could change\nbased on results of the 2022 CCAR\ncapital plan and related supervisory\nstress tests that we submitted in April\n2022.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 7 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021.

The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to\nthe qualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\n                                                                                  \n  19Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2022, CET1 capital was\n$169.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9\nbillion from December 31, 2021, driven\nby common stock repurchases, dividends\nand increases in net unrealized losses\non available-for-sale (AFS) debt\nsecurities included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (OCI), partially\noffset by earnings. Tier 1 capital\nincreased $542 million primarily driven\nby non-cumulative perpetual preferred\nstock issuances, partially offset by the\nsame factors as CET1 capital. Total\ncapital under the Standardized approach\nincreased $1.6 billion primarily driven\nby the same factors driving the increase\n\nin Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt\nissuances and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital. RWA under\nthe Standardized approach, which yielded\nthe lower CET1 capital ratio at March\n31, 2022, increased $21.1 billion during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022 to\n$1,639 billion primarily due to loan\ngrowth and client activity in Global\nMarkets . Supplementary leverage\nexposure at March 31, 2022 increased\n$58.1 billion primarily due to on and\noff-balance sheet growth in Global\nMarkets .

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $339 billion and\n$322 billion at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nparent company or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior regulatory\napproval. Liquidity is also held in\nnonbank entities, including the parent,\nNB Holdings and other regulated\nentities. The parent company and NB\nHoldings liquidity is typically in the\nform of cash deposited at BANA, which is\nexcluded from the liquidity at bank\nsubsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Liquidity held\nin other regulated entities, comprised\nprimarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nis primarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the parent company or to\nany other subsidiary may be subject to\nprior regulatory approval due to\nregulatory restrictions and minimum\n\nrequirements. Our other regulated\nentities also hold unencumbered\ninvestment-grade securities and equities\nthat we believe could be used to\ngenerate additional liquidity.

However, HQLA for purposes\nof calculating LCR is not reported at\nmarket value, but at a lower value that\nincorporates regulatory deductions and\nthe exclusion of excess liquidity held\nat certain subsidiaries. The LCR is\ncalculated as the amount of a financial\ninstitution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative\nto the estimated net cash outflows the\ninstitution could encounter over a\n30-day period of significant liquidity\nstress, expressed as a percentage. Our\naverage consolidated HQLA, on a net\nbasis, was $616 billion and $617 billion\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. For the same\nperiods, the average consolidated LCR\nwas 116 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR\nfluctuates due to normal business flows\nfrom customer activity. Liquidity Stress\nAnalysis We utilize liquidity stress\nanalysis to assist us in determining the\nappropriate amounts of liquidity to\nmaintain at the parent company and our\nsubsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range\nof scenarios. For more information on\nliquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 Liquidity Stress Analysis in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Net Stable Funding\nRatio The Net Stable Funding Ratio\n(NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for\nlarge banks to maintain a minimum level\nof stable funding over a one-year\nperiod. The requirement is intended to\nsupport the ability of banks to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses in both normal\nand adverse economic conditions and is\ncomplementary to the LCR, which focuses\non short-term liquidity risks. The U.S.\nNSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. At March 31,\n2022, the Corporation and its insured\ndepository institutions were in\ncompliance with this requirement.\nDiversified Funding Sources We fund our\nassets primarily with a mix of deposits,\nand secured and unsecured liabilities\nthrough a centralized, globally\ncoordinated funding approach diversified\nacross products, programs, markets,\ncurrencies and investor groups.

For more\ninformation on our TLAC eligible and\ncallable outstanding notes, see\nLiquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified Funding\nSources in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $1.4\nbillion to $278.7 billion during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to debt valuation\nadjustments, maturities and redemptions,\npartially offset by debt issuances. We\nmay, from time to time, purchase\noutstanding debt instruments in various\ntransactions, depending on market\nconditions, liquidity and other factors.\nOur other regulated entities may also\nmake markets in our debt instruments to\nprovide liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2022, we issued $2.7 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change\n\nin our credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage\nthe duration, interest rate and currency\nrisks of our borrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, net charge-offs\ndecreased $353 million to $340 million\nprimarily driven by lower credit card\nlosses, as loss rates remained near\nhistoric lows. During the three months\nended March 31, 2022, nonperforming\nloans increased primarily due to loans\nwith expired payment deferrals that were\nmodified as troubled debt restructurings\n(TDRs) during the quarter.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $318 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2022 to $6.7 billion.

have not yet demonstrated a\nsustained period of payment performance\nfollowing a TDR.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\nincreased $138 million during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 primarily\ndue to loans with expired payment\ndeferrals that were modified as TDRs\nduring the quarter. Of the nonperforming\nresidential mortgage loans at March 31,\n2022, $1.4 billion, or 59 percent, were\ncurrent on contractual payments. Loans\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ndecreased $154 million.\n\nNet recoveries of $10 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022\nremained relatively unchanged compared\nto the same period in 2021.\n\nOf the $213.6 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat March 31, 2022, 27 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period was $4.5\nbillion, or eight percent, at March 31,\n2022. Residential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization period\ngenerally experienced a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At March 31, 2022, $37 million,\nor one percent, of outstanding interest-\nonly residential mortgages that had\nentered the amortization period\n\nwere accruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $712 million or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2022, $264 million, or six\npercent, of outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $98 million were\ncontractually current. Loans that have\nyet to enter the amortization period in\nour interest-only residential mortgage\nportfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three to ten years.\nApproximately 93 percent of these loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n\nTable 19 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nand 15 percent of outstandings at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In the\nNew York area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island MSA made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n                                                           T\u2026                     \n  T\u2026                                                       M\u2026                     \n  19    R\u2026       Ou\u2026                No\u2026                    E\u2026                     \n  (\u2026    M\u2026       Ma\u2026       D\u2026       Ma\u2026       D\u2026           M\u2026                     \n  in    S\u2026        31       31        31       31           31       Net           \n  m\u2026    C\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026       Ch\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026          $  79\u2026    $  7\u2026    $  735    $  6\u2026                 $   -3    $  -2  \n  N\u2026             25\u2026       2\u2026       381       3\u2026                      \u2014        2  \n  Y\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026             14\u2026       1\u2026       165       1\u2026                     -1       -2  \n  T\u2026             9,\u2026       9\u2026        92       86                      \u2014        \u2014  \n  N\u2026             8,\u2026       8\u2026       121       1\u2026                      \u2014        \u2014  \n  J\u2026                                                                              \n  O\u2026             76\u2026       7\u2026       928       8\u2026                     -6       -2  \n  R\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026          $  21\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  2\u2026                 $  -10    $  -4  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026                                                                              \n  l\u2026             12\u2026       1\u2026                                                     \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n  T\u2026                                                                              \n  r\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026          $  22\u2026    $  2\u2026                                                     \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2022, the home equity\nportfolio made up six percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years, and after the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans\ngenerally convert to 15- or 20-year\namortizing loans.

In addition, $228 million, or\n37 percent of nonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more past due and\nhad been written down to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, less costs\nto sell.

The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At March 31,\n\n2022, $71 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2022, $455 million, or seven\npercent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, 18 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 21 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve a\nreduction in the customer\u2019s interest\nrate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other\nconsumer loans are made through programs\nutilizing direct customer contact, but\nmay also utilize external programs. At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nour credit card and other consumer TDR\nportfolio was $646 million and $672\nmillion, of which $572 million and $599\nmillion were current or less than 30\ndays past due under the modified terms.\n                                                                                  \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                    \n                                                                                  \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 30, 33 and 36 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For more information\non our industry concentrations, see\nTable 33\n\nand Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations on\npage 34.\n\nFor more information on our accounting\npolicies regarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status, net charge-offs\nand TDRs for the commercial portfolio,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Commercial Credit Portfolio                                                     \n                                                                                  \nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2022, commercial credit quality improved\nas charge-offs, nonperforming commercial\nloans and reservable criticized utilized\nexposure declined during this period.\nDue to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine\nconflict, all of the $759 million of\ndirect exposure to Russian\ncounterparties has been downgraded and\nreported as reservable criticized\nexposure, and expected credit losses\nhave been incorporated into our estimate\nof the allowance for credit losses.\nOutstanding commercial loans and leases\nincreased $10.9 billion during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 due to\ngrowth in commercial and industrial,\nprimarily in Global Banking . This\nincrease was partially offset by lower\nU.S. small business commercial loans due\nto repayments of PPP loans by the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) under the\nterms of the program. For more\ninformation on PPP loans, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America30                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCredit quality of commercial real estate\nborrowers continued to stabilize in many\nsectors as economies have continued to\nreopen and pandemic-impacted sectors\ncontinue to recover. However, many real\nestate markets, while improving, are\nstill experiencing some disruptions in\ndemand, supply chain challenges and\ntenant difficulties. Demand for office\nspace is uncertain as companies evaluate\nspace needs with employment models that\nutilize a mix of remote and conventional\noffice use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses remained relatively flat at\n$5.4 billion, as asset quality\nimprovements were offset by a reserve\nbuild related to Russian exposure and\nloan growth. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 37.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $20.5 billion during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022 to\n\n$674.0 billion primarily driven by\nderivative assets and higher loans and\nleases.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in\nour credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $3.4 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $9 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022 compared to net losses of $36 million for same\nperiod in 2021.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing\n\nactivities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of\nbusiness through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than\nthrough country risk governance.

Net country exposure\nfor these 20 countries increased $36.9\nbillion during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 primarily driven by\nincreases in the United Kingdom, Japan\nand Germany, partially

Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 39 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and\n\nless liquid trading positions) portfolio\nand the fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 39 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 39 presents period-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022,\nDecember 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021\nusing a 99 percent confidence level. The\namounts disclosed in Table 39 and Table\n40 align to the view of covered\npositions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and\ncommodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, regardless\nof trading or banking treatment for the\ntrade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe average of total covered positions\nand less liquid trading positions\nportfolio VaR increased for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 compared to\nthe prior quarter primarily due to\ndecreased diversification benefit across\nEquities and FICC and increased FX\nexposures through market making\nactivities.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                               $      $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                               $                  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading\ndays than the high and low for the components.

Periodically, we evaluate the\nscenarios presented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of the current\nrate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates\nare floored at zero. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, the overall\ndecrease in asset sensitivity of our\nbalance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate\nscenarios was primarily due to an\nincrease in long-end rates. We continue\nto be asset sensitive to a parallel\nupward move in interest rates with the\nmajority of that impact coming from the\nshort end of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates\nnegatively impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities classified as available\nfor sale and adversely affect\naccumulated other comprehensive income\nand thus capital levels under the Basel\n3 capital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital would\nbe reduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net interest income\ngenerated from the banking book\nactivities.

As part of our ALM activities,\nwe use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our\ndeposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 42 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size\nor mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate\nscenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding\nwould reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative\ncontracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange\nrisks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in\ncash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange\nbasis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts\ninclude cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts,\nforeign currency forward contracts and options. The derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily\nused to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate\nRisk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities\npresented in Table 42. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in\naccounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our\nforeign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant.\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks\nrelated to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and\neliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the\nCorporation\u2019s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments.\nThese foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures\nsuch as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on\nthe accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and\nservice mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate\nrisks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or\nheld for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by\nselling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in interest\nrates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related\nresidential first\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as\nwell as the value of the MSRs. Because\nthe interest rate risks of these hedged\nitems offset, we combine them into one\noverall hedged item with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio consisting of\nderivative contracts and securities. For\nmore information on IRLCs and the\nrelated residential mortgage LHFS, see\nMortgage Banking Risk Management in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021, we recorded gains of $14\nmillion and $13 million related to the\nchange in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and\nLHFS, net of gains and losses on the\nhedge portfolio. For more information on\nMSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, which may entail extensive\npolicy, legal, technology and market\nchanges, and (2) risks related to the\nphysical impacts of climate change,\ndriven by extreme weather events, such\nas hurricanes and floods, as well as\nchronic longer-term shifts, such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels. These changes and events can\nhave broad impacts on operations, supply\nchains, distribution networks, customers\nand markets and are otherwise referred\nto, respectively, as transition risk and\nphysical risk. These risks can impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. The impacts of transition risk\ncan lead to and amplify credit risk or\nmarket risk by reducing our customers\u2019\noperating income or the value of their\nassets as well as expose us to\nreputational and/or litigation risk due\nto increased regulatory scrutiny or\nnegative public sentiment. Physical risk\ncan lead to increased credit risk by\ndiminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or impacting the value of\ncollateral. In addition, it could pose\nincreased operational risk to our\nfacilities and people.\n\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our goal\nto achieve net zero greenhouse gas\nemissions in our financing activities,\noperations and supply chain before 2050\n(Net Zero Goal). We also committed to\nset emission reduction targets for 2030.\nIn connection with this commitment, on\nApril 13, 2022, we published our first\ntargets to reduce emissions by 2030\nassociated with our financing activities\nin the auto manufacturing, energy and\npower generation sectors (2030 Targets).\nThese reduction targets are intended to\nalign with the goal to limit warming to\n1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nWe plan to disclose our 2019 financed\nemissions baseline for our auto\nmanufacturing, energy and power\ngeneration sectors along with 2020 data\nin our 2022 Task Force for Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nReport that we expect to publish in the\nFall of 2022.

holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and\n\ndisclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates\nand assumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the Corporation\u2019s\nbusiness is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a full year.\nIn the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Certain prior-\nperiod amounts have been reclassified to\nconform to current period presentation.\nAccounting Standards Issued and Not Yet\nAdopted Hedge Accounting The FASB issued\na new accounting standard effective on\nJanuary 1, 2023, with early adoption\npermitted, that makes targeted\nimprovements to the application of the\nfair value hedge accounting guidance for\nclosed portfolios of financial assets.\nUpon adoption, the application of these\nhedge strategies would be applied\nprospectively.

The Corporation also uses these\ntypes of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and\nliabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation\nhedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have\nfunctional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts\nand cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt\n(net investment hedges).

At both March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 4.8billion of non-U.S.\ngovernment-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received\ngross cash proceeds of $ 4.8billion at\nthe transfer dates. At both March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of the transferred securities was\n$ 5.0billion. Sales and Trading Revenue\nThe Corporation enters into trading\nderivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk\nexposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.

These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation held\ncash and securities collateral of $\n98.9billion and $ 91.4billion and posted\ncash and securities collateral of $\n83.0billion and $ 79.3billion in the\nnormal course of business under\nderivative agreements, excluding cross-\nproduct margining agreements where\nclients are permitted to margin on a net\nbasis for both derivative and secured\nfinancing arrangements. In connection\nwith certain OTC derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the\nCorporation can be required to provide\nadditional collateral or to terminate\ntransactions with certain counterparties\nin the event of a downgrade of the\nsenior debt ratings of the Corporation\nor certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends\non the contract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more\ninformation on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. At March 31, 2022, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the\nterms of the contracts, that the\nCorporation and certain subsidiaries\ncould be required to post to\ncounterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.0billion,\nincluding $ 1.5billion for Bank of\nAmerica, National Association. Some\ncounterparties are currently able to\nunilaterally terminate certain\ncontracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take\nother action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee.

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 residential mortgage includes $\n468million and $ 444million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing\ninterest, although principal was still insured, and $ 106million and $ 190million\nof loans on which interest was still accruing.\n\n(2) Primarily relates to loans for which the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less any costs to sell is greater than the amortized cost of\nthe loans as of the reporting date.\n\nn/a = not applicable\nCredit Quality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality within its\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate,\nCredit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of\nfinancing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at March 31,\n2022, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional\ncredit decision after origination or through a TDR.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America62                                                               \n

Concessions may\ninclude reductions in interest rates,\ncapitalization of past due amounts,\nprincipal and/or interest forbearance,\npayment extensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or combinations\nthereof. Prior to permanently modifying\na loan, the Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with certain\nborrowers under both government and\nproprietary programs. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a\nthree- to four-month period during which\nthe borrower makes monthly payments\nunder the anticipated modified payment\nterms. Upon successful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation and the\nborrower enter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n280million that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by\nthe borrower were\n\nincluded in TDRs at March 31, 2022, of\nwhich $ 78million were classified as\nnonperforming and $ 49million were loans\nfully insured.

Consumer real estate\nforeclosed properties totaled $\n118million and $ 101million at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. The carrying\nvalue of consumer real estate loans,\nincluding fully-insured loans, for which\nformal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess at March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021 was $ 1.0billion and $\n1.1billion. During the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nCorporation reclassified $ 56million and\n$ 10million of consumer real estate\nloans to foreclosed properties or, for\nproperties acquired upon foreclosure of\ncertain government-guaranteed loans\n(principally FHA-insured loans), to\nother assets.

Credit card and other consumer loan\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the\ncustomer\u2019s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The\nCorporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by\nthe Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan\nmodifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nprovide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external\nprograms). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral\nvalue and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 10percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 17percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing the\nborrower with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique and reflects the\nindividual circumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that result in a\nTDR may include extensions of maturity\nat a concessionary (below market) rate\nof interest,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America68                                                               \n                                                                                  \npayment forbearances or other actions\ndesigned to benefit the borrower while\nmitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk\nexposure. Reductions in interest rates\nare rare. Instead, the interest rates\nare typically increased, although the\nincreased rate may not represent a\nmarket rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal\nforgiveness in connection with\nforeclosure, short sale or other\nsettlement agreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the loan. At the\ntime of restructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash flows resulting\nfrom the modified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded at the time\nof restructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already been\nrecorded in a previous period such that\nno charge-off is required at the time of\nmodification. During the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the\ncarrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommercial loans that were modified as\nTDRs was $ 848million and $ 680million.\nAt March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe Corporation had commitments to lend\n$ 386million and $ 283million to\ncommercial borrowers whose loans were\nclassified as TDRs. The balance of\ncommercial TDRs in payment default was $\n258million and $ 262million at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. Loans Held-\nfor-sale The Corporation had LHFS of $\n10.3billion and $ 15.6billion at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Cash and\nnon-cash proceeds from sales and\npaydowns of loans originally classified\nas LHFS were $ 13.3billion and $\n9.9billion for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021. Cash used for\noriginations and purchases of LHFS\ntotaled $ 6.8billion and $ 8.3billion\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021. Also included were non-\ncash net transfers into LHFS of $\n1.5billion for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, primarily driven by the\ntransfer of a $ 1.6billion affinity card\nloan portfolio to held for sale in\nanticipation of its sale later in 2022,\nand $ 481million for the three months\nended March 31, 2021. Accrued Interest\nReceivable Accrued interest receivable\nfor loans and leases and loans held-for-\nsale at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021 was $ 2.3billion and $ 2.2billion\nand is reported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation\nreversed $ 131million and $ 158million\nof interest and fee income against the\nincome statement line item in which it\nwas originally recorded upon charge-off\nof the principal balance of the loan .\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022 and\n2021, interest and fee income reversed\nat the time the loans were classified as\nnonperforming was not significant. For\nmore information on the Corporation's\nnonperforming loan policies, see Note 1\n\u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the\nquantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The March 31, 2022 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic outlooks that included\na baseline scenario, which is derived\nfrom consensus estimates, a downside\nscenario that assumed a significantly\nlonger period until full economic\nrecovery, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing, and a scenario to\naccount for inflationary risk and higher\ninterest rates at levels above what is\nalready factored into the Corporation\u2019s\nbaseline and other downside scenarios.\nThe Corporation\u2019s upside scenario was\nremoved as of March 31, 2022 given that\nthe recent geopolitical environment may\nlimit an upside outlook. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes that the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate will be\n5.0percent by the fourth quarter of 2022\nand thereafter will slowly decline to\njust above 4.5percent by the fourth\nquarter of 2023. Additionally, in this\neconomic outlook, U.S. gross domestic\nproduct is forecasted to grow at\n1.4percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2022 and 2023. While asset\nquality continues to point to economic\nrecovery and there have been signs of\nrelief from the COVID-19 pandemic (the\npandemic), uncertainty remains about the\ntiming and strength of the economy\u2019s\nrecovery, which could be hampered by\nbroader economic impacts as a result of\nthe current geopolitical situation,\nsupply chain disruptions and\ninflationary pressures, and could lead\nto adverse impacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods. As such, the\nCorporation has factored the\naforementioned uncertainties into its\nallowance for credit losses. The\nallowance for credit losses at March 31,\n2022 was $ 13.5billion, a decrease of $\n360million compared to December 31,\n2021. The decrease in the allowance for\ncredit losses was primarily driven by\ncredit quality improvements, offset by a\nreserve build related to Russian\nexposure and loan growth. The change in\nthe allowance for credit losses was\ncomprised of a net decrease of $\n283million in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a $ 77million decrease\nin the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The decrease in the\nallowance for credit losses was\nattributed to $ 89million in the\nconsumer real estate portfolio, $\n234million in the credit card and other\nconsumer portfolio, and $ 37million in\nthe commercial portfolio. The provision\nfor credit losses was $ 30million during\n                                                                                  \n  69Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nthree months ended March 31, 2022, as asset quality improvements were offset by a\nreserve build related to Russian exposure and loan growth. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $ 1.9billion compared to the same period in 2021,\nprimarily due to the impact of the improved macroeconomic outlook in the prior-\nyear period. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the\nfair value option increased $ 14.7billion during the three months ended March 31,\n2022 driven by commercial loans, which increased $ 12.7billion excluding small\nbusiness, primarily driven by Global Banking . Consumer loans increased $\n3.2billion primarily driven by new originations in Residential Mortgage.

The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) from the sale\nor securitization of consumer real estate loans.

                        \n(1) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes\noutstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n\n(2) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans and leases in the consolidated\ncredit card trust included $ 3.8billion and $ 4.3billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s\ninterest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables\nand cash reserve accounts. No new senior debt securities were issued to third-\nparty investors from the credit card securitization trust during the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and 2021. At both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization\ntrust with a notional principal amount of $ 6.5billion. These securities serve as\na form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated\ninterest rate of zeropercent. No subordinate securities were issued by the credit\ncard securitization trust during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.\nResecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into\nresecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities\nwith specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing\nactivities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the\nunilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $\n9.5billion and $ 1.0billion of securities during the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar\nactivities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale\nwas recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n699million and $ 178million, of which substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets for both periods. Trading account securities\ncarried at fair value were largely categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts\nthat hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain\nfinancing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or\nother short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity\ncommitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the\nCorporation was transferor, totaled $ 4.1billion at both March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts\nat March 31, 2022 was 6.2years. There were no significant write-downs or\ndowngrades of assets or issuers during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and\n2021.\n

commodity-\nlinked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically\ncreated on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a\nspecific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n1.1billion and $ 2.9billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, including the\nnotional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of\nlosses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation\nreceives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-\nincome securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by\nissuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally\nmanaged by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers\nassets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative\ncounterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated\nand unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 205million and $ 235million at March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. Investment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or\nprovides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a\nvariety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other\nfinancial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile\nto investors or the Corporation. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $ 652million and $\n1.0billion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with\ntotal assets of $ 7.7billion and $ 7.1billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated\nand unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 1.7billion and $ 2.0billion at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less\nnon-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.5billion at both March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars,\npower generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The\nnet investment represents the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. Tax\nCredit VIEs The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities\nof the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other\nVIEs table was $ 26.3billion and $ 25.7billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring\nthat the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its\ninvestment.\n                                                                                  \n  73Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s investments in\naffordable housing partnerships, which\nare reported in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $\n12.9billion and $ 12.6billion, including\nunfunded commitments to provide capital\ncontributions of $ 5.9billion and $\n5.8billion, at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The unfunded\ncommitments are expected to be paid over\nthe next five years. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,\nthe Corporation recognized tax credits\nand other tax benefits from investments\nin affordable housing partnerships of $\n373million and $ 393million and reported\npretax losses in other income of $\n313million and $ 276million. These tax\ncredits are recognized as part of the\nCorporation\u2019s annual effective tax rate\nused to determine tax expense in a given\nquarter. The Corporation may be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant.

held on\ndeposit with central banks to meet\nreserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. For more\ninformation on commitments and\ncontingencies, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Credit Extension Commitments The\nCorporation enters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\n\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 11.0billion and $ 10.7billion at\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncredit extension commitments at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nexcluding commitments accounted for\nunder the fair value option, was $\n1.4billion and $ 1.5billion, which\npredominantly related to the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these commitments is\nclassified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Legally binding commitments to\nextend credit generally have specified\nrates and maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 4.0billion and $\n4.8billion at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 that are accounted for\nunder the fair value option. However,\nthe table excludes the cumulative net\nfair value for these commitments of $\n136million and $ 97million at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, which is\nclassified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 487million and $ 512million\nat March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 987million and $ 181million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 984million and $ 518million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation\nhad commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $\n1.4billion and $ 949million, which upon settlement will be included in trading\naccount assets. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had\ncommitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing\nagreements of $ 101.2billion and $ 92.0billion, and commitments to enter into\nforward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 54.4billion and $\n32.6billion. These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months. At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had a commitment to\noriginate or purchase up to $ 3.9billion and $ 4.0billion on a rolling 12-month\nbasis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends\nthrough November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior notice. At March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment\ncommitments of $ 397million and $ 395million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life\nInsurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book\nvalue protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nnotional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 4.4billion and $ 6.3billion. At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related\nto these guarantees totaled $ 654million and $ 928million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable\nfor any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to,\namong other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed\nafter a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The\nability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was $ 475.1billion, is an estimate of the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of March 31, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s\nrisk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has\npurchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this\nrisk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of\ncollateral from certain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent\nlosses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were\nnot significant. The Corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area\ndue to the potential economic impacts of the pandemic. Representations and\nWarranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 12 \u2013\n                                                                                  \n  77Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nCommitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K . The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 1.2billion at both\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and\nis included in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, and the related provision\nis included in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions, and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 39.5billion and $ 42.0billion at\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities issued by certain\nstatutory trust companies that are\n100percent owned finance subsidiaries of\nthe Corporation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure).\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and for the matters disclosed\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, whether a loss\nin excess of any accrued liability is\nreasonably possible in future periods.\nOnce the loss contingency is deemed to\nbe both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued\nliability and record a corresponding\namount of litigation-related expense.\nThe Corporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation-related expense of\n$ 106million and $ 34million was\nrecognized for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021. For any matter\ndisclosed in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure for which a\nloss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n1.0billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of March 31, 2022.\nThe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are based upon\ncurrently available information and\nsubject to significant judgment, a\nvariety of assumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The matters\nunderlying the accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual.

The Corporation\ndetermines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable\naccounting standards and conducts a\nreview of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if\nthe significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent marketplace. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, there were\nno changes to valuation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are expected to\nhave, a material impact on the\nCorporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations. For\nmore information regarding the fair\nvalue hierarchy, how the Corporation\nmeasures fair value and valuation\ntechniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2021 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.
