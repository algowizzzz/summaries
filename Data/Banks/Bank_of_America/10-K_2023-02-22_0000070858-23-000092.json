We value our employees and seek to establish and maintain human\nresource policies that are consistent with our core values and help to realize the\npower of our people. Our Board and its Compensation and Human Capital Committee\nprovide oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs and\npractices. The Corporation\u2019s senior management provides regular briefings on human\ncapital matters to the Board and its Committees to facilitate the Board\u2019s\noversight. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation employed approximately\n217,000 and 208,000 employees, of which 79 percent and 80 percent were located in\nthe U.S. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining\nagreement. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021, the Corporation\u2019s compensation and\nbenefits expense was $36.4 billion and $36.1 billion, or 59 percent and 61\npercent, of total noninterest expense. Diversity and Inclusion The Corporation\u2019s\ncommitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with oversight from our\nBoard and CEO. The Corporation\u2019s senior management sets the diversity and\ninclusion goals, and the Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity &\nInclusion Officer partner with our CEO and senior management to drive our\ndiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies. The Global\nDiversity and Inclusion Council, which consists of senior executives from every\nline of business and region, is chaired by our CEO and has been in place for over\n20 years. The Council sponsors and supports business, operating unit and regional\ndiversity and inclusion councils to align with enterprise diversity strategies and\ngoals. Our practices and policies have resulted in strong representation across\nthe Corporation where our broad employee population mirrors the clients and\ncommunities we serve. We have a Board and senior management team that are 53\npercent and 55 percent racially, ethnically and gender diverse. The following\ntable presents diversity metrics for our global employees who self-identified as\nwomen and our U.S.-based employees who self-identified as people of color,\nincluding those who self-identified as Asian, Black/African American and\nHispanic/Latino.

Further, we partner with various\nexternal organizations, which focus on\nadvancing diverse talent. We also have\npractices in place for attracting and\nretaining diverse talent, including\ncampus recruitment. For example, in\n2022, 44 percent of our global campus\nhires were women and, in the U.S., 59\npercent were people of color. Employee\nEngagement and Talent Retention As part\nof our ongoing efforts to make the\nCorporation a great place to work, we\nhave conducted a confidential annual\nEmployee Engagement Survey (Survey) for\nnearly two decades. The Survey results\nare reviewed by the Board and senior\nmanagement and used to assist in\nreviewing the Corporation\u2019s human\ncapital strategies, programs and\npractices. In 2022, 85 percent of the\nCorporation\u2019s employees participated in\nthe Survey, and our Employee Engagement\nIndex, an overall measure of employee\nsatisfaction with the Corporation, was\n85 percent. Our turnover among employees\nwas 13 percent in 2022 and 12 percent in\n2021. Additionally, the Corporation\nprovides a variety of resources to help\nemployees grow in their current roles\nand build new skills, including\nresources to help employees find new\nopportunities, re-skill and seek\nleadership positions. The learning and\ndevelopment strategy is grounded in the\ndevelopment of horizontal skills\ndelivered throughout the organization.\nSenior leaders, managers and teammates\nare onboarded and build horizontal\nskills, as well as role-specific skills,\nto help drive high performance. This\napproach also helps facilitate internal\nmobility and promotion of talent to\nbuild a bench of qualified managers and\nleaders. In 2022, more than 30,000\nemployees found new roles within the\nCorporation, and we delivered more than\n11 million hours of training and\ndevelopment to our teammates through\nBank of America Academy. Additionally,\nour Board oversees CEO and senior\nmanagement succession planning, which is\nformally reviewed at least annually.\n                                                                                  \n  3Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Fair and Equitable Compensation                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation is committed to racial\nand gender pay equity by striving to\ncompensate all of our employees fairly\nand equitably. We maintain robust\npolicies and practices that reinforce\nour commitment, including reviews\nconducted by a third-party consultant\nwith oversight from our Board and senior\nmanagement. In 2022, our review covered\nour regional hubs (U.S., U.K., France,\nIreland, Hong Kong and Singapore) and\nIndia and showed that compensation\nreceived by women, on average, was\ngreater than 99 percent of that received\nby men in comparable positions. In the\nU.S., compensation received by people of\ncolor was, on average, greater than 99\npercent of that received by teammates\nwho are not people of color in\ncomparable positions.\n\nWe also strive to pay our employees\nfairly based on market rates for their\nroles, experience and how they perform.\nWe regularly benchmark against other\ncompanies both within and outside our\nindustry to help confirm our pay is\ncompetitive. In 2021, the Corporation\nannounced it would increase its minimum\nhourly wage for U.S. employees to $25\nper hour by 2025. In June 2022, as a\nnext step, the Corporation increased its\nhourly minimum wage for U.S. employees\nto $22 per hour. In addition, in January\n2023, for the sixth year since 2017, we\nannounced that we recognized our\nteammates with Sharing Success\ncompensation awards for their efforts\nduring 2022. Approximately 96 percent of\nemployees globally will receive an award\nin the first quarter of 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Health and Wellness \u2013 2022 Focus                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation is also committed to\nsupporting employees\u2019 physical,\nemotional and financial wellness by\noffering flexible and competitive\nbenefits, including comprehensive health\nand insurance benefits and wellness\nresources. During 2022, we continued\nefforts to support our employees through\nthe ongoing health crisis resulting from\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We\nprovided no-cost COVID-19 testing and\nteammates with incentives for getting\nthe vaccine and booster. We also held\non-site flu and COVID-19 vaccine and\nbooster clinics.\n\nWe continued our efforts around\nproviding affordable access to\nhealthcare, including offering no-cost,\n24/7 access to virtual general medical\nand behavioral health resources to help\nour enrolled U.S. teammates stay\nhealthy, both physically and\nemotionally. We kept U.S. health\ninsurance premiums unchanged for\nteammates earning less than $50,000 for\nthe tenth year in a row, and had nominal\npremium increases for teammates earning\nfrom $50,000 up to $100,000 for the\nsixth year in a row. We provided in-\nnetwork generic prescription medications\nat no cost for teammates enrolled in a\nU.S. bank medical PPO or Consumer Direct\nplan, along with continuing preventative\ncare medications at no cost for all U.S.\nmedical plans.\n\nWe offer an extensive benefit package\nand support work-life balance for our\nteammates, which includes in the U.S.,\n16 weeks of paid parental leave for both\nprimary and secondary\n\ncaregivers and backup dependent care (50\ndays of child and adult backup care per\nyear). We doubled the number of no-cost\nconfidential counseling sessions from\nsix to 12 for all employees and family\nmembers and now offer 12 globally.\n\nFor more information about our human\ncapital management, see the\nCorporation\u2019s website and 2022 Annual\nReport to shareholders that will be\navailable on the Investor Relations\nportion of our website in March 2023\n(the content of which is not\nincorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K).\n                                                                                  \n  Government Supervision and Regulation                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe following discussion describes,\namong other things, elements of an\nextensive regulatory framework\napplicable to BHCs, financial holding\ncompanies, banks and broker-dealers,\nincluding specific information about\nBank of America.\n\nWe are subject to an extensive\nregulatory framework applicable to BHCs,\nfinancial holding companies and banks\nand other financial services entities.\nU.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs\nand financial holding companies is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and the Deposit Insurance\nFund (DIF) rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and\ncreditors.\n\nAs a registered financial holding\ncompany and BHC, the Corporation is\nsubject to the supervision of, and\nregular inspection by, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries (the Banks), organized as\nnational banking associations, are\nsubject to regulation, supervision and\nexamination by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC have adopted guidelines that\nestablish minimum standards for the\ndesign, implementation and board\noversight of BHCs\u2019 and national banks\u2019\nrisk governance frameworks. U.S.\nfinancial holding companies, and the\ncompanies under their control, are\npermitted to engage in activities\nconsidered \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d as\ndefined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nand related Federal Reserve\ninterpretations. The Corporation's\nstatus as a financial holding company is\nconditioned upon maintaining certain\neligibility requirements for both the\nCorporation and its U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiaries, including\nminimum capital ratios, supervisory\nratings and, in the case of the\ndepository institutions, at least\nsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act\nratings. Failure to be an eligible\nfinancial holding company could result\nin the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of\nAmerica's activities, including\npotential acquisitions. Additionally, we\nare subject to a significant number of\nlaws, rules and regulations that govern\nour businesses in the U.S. and in the\nother jurisdictions in which we operate,\nincluding permissible activities,\nminimum levels of capital and liquidity,\ncompliance risk management, consumer\nproducts and sales practices, anti-money\nlaundering and anti-corruption,\ngovernment sanctions, privacy, data\nprotection and executive compensation,\namong others.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America4                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe scope of the laws and regulations\nand the intensity of the supervision to\nwhich we are subject have increased over\nthe past several years, beginning with\nthe response to the 2008 financial\ncrisis, as well as other factors such as\ntechnological and market changes. In\naddition, the banking and financial\nservices sector is subject to\nsubstantial regulatory enforcement and\nfines. Many of these changes have\noccurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the Financial Reform\nAct). We cannot assess whether there\nwill be any additional major changes in\nthe regulatory environment and expect\nthat our business will remain subject to\ncontinuing and extensive regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nWe are also subject to various other\nlaws and regulations, as well as\nsupervision and examination by other\nregulatory agencies, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly affect our\nentities, management and ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. For\ninstance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to both U.S. and\ninternational regulation, including\nsupervision by the SEC, Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority and New\nYork Stock Exchange, among others; our\nfutures commission merchant subsidiaries\nsupporting commodities and derivatives\nbusinesses in the U.S. are subject to\nregulation by and supervision of the\nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC), National Futures\nAssociation, the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange, and in the case of the Banks,\ncertain banking regulators; our\ninsurance activities are subject to\nlicensing and regulation by state\ninsurance regulatory agencies; and our\nconsumer financial products and services\nare regulated by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by various\nnon-U.S. regulators, including\ngovernments, securities exchanges,\nprudential regulators, central banks and\nother regulatory bodies, in the\njurisdictions in which those businesses\noperate. For example, our financial\nservices entities in the United Kingdom\n(U.K.), Ireland and France are subject\nto regulation by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority and Financial\nConduct Authority (FCA), the European\nCentral Bank and Central Bank of\nIreland, and the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le\nPrudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and Autorit\u00e9\ndes March\u00e9s Financiers, respectively.\n                                                                                  \n  Source of Strength                                                              \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Financial Reform Act and\nFederal Reserve policy, BHCs are\nexpected to act as a source of financial\nstrength to each subsidiary bank and to\ncommit resources to support each such\nsubsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-\nguarantee provisions of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the\nevent of a loss suffered or anticipated\nby the FDIC, either as a result of\ndefault of a bank subsidiary or related\nto FDIC assistance provided to such a\nsubsidiary in danger of default, the\naffiliate banks of such a subsidiary may\nbe assessed for the FDIC\u2019s loss, subject\nto certain exceptions.\n                                                                                  \n  Transactions with Affiliates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act, as implemented by\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the\nBanks are subject to restrictions that\nlimit certain types of transactions\nbetween the Banks and their nonbank\naffiliates. In general, U.S.\n\nbanks are subject to quantitative and\nqualitative limits on extensions of\ncredit, purchases of assets and certain\nother transactions involving their\nnonbank affiliates. Additionally,\ntransactions between U.S. banks and\ntheir nonbank affiliates are required to\nbe on arm\u2019s length terms and must be\nconsistent with standards of safety and\nsoundness.\n                                                                                  \n  Deposit Insurance                                                               \n                                                                                  \nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks\nare insured by the FDIC, subject to\nlimits and conditions of applicable law\nand the FDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant to\nthe Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance\ncoverage limits are $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank for each\naccount ownership category. All insured\ndepository institutions are required to\npay assessments to the FDIC in order to\nfund the DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain a\nstatutory minimum ratio of the DIF to\ninsured deposits in the U.S. of at least\n1.35 percent and has established a long-\nterm goal of a two percent DIF ratio. As\nof the date of this report, the DIF is\nbelow the statutory minimum ratio and\nthe FDIC\u2019s long-term goal. In October\n2022, the FDIC adopted a restoration\nplan that includes an increase in\ndeposit insurance assessments across the\nindustry of two basis points (bps). The\nFDIC has indicated that it intends to\nmaintain such assessment rates for the\nforeseeable future. Deposit insurance\nassessment rates are subject to change\nby the FDIC and will be impacted by the\noverall economy and the stability of the\nbanking industry as a whole.

These rules are\ncomplex and are evolving as U.S. and\ninternational regulatory authorities\npropose and enact amendments to these\nrules. The Corporation seeks to manage\nits capital position to maintain\nsufficient capital to satisfy these\nregulatory rules and to support our\nbusiness activities. These continually\nevolving rules are likely to influence\nour planning processes and may require\nadditional regulatory capital and\nliquidity, as well as impose additional\noperational and compliance costs on the\nCorporation.\n\nFor more information on regulatory\ncapital rules, capital composition and\npending or proposed regulatory capital\nchanges, see Capital Management on page\n49, and Note 16 \u2013 Regulatory\nRequirements and Restrictions to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, which\nare incorporated by reference in this\nItem 1.\n                                                                                  \n  Distributions                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to various regulatory\npolicies and requirements relating to\ncapital actions, including payment of\ndividends and common stock repurchases.\nFor instance, Federal Reserve\nregulations require major U.S. BHCs to\nsubmit a capital plan as part of an\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR).\n                                                                                  \n  5Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nOur ability to pay dividends and make\ncommon stock repurchases depends in part\non our ability to maintain regulatory\ncapital levels above minimum\nrequirements plus buffers and non-\ncapital standards established under the\nFDICIA. To the extent that the Federal\nReserve increases our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB), global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge or\ncountercyclical capital buffer, our\nreturns of capital to shareholders,\nincluding dividends and common stock\nrepurchases, could decrease. As part of\nits CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts\nstress testing on parts of our business\nusing hypothetical economic scenarios\nprepared by the Federal Reserve. Those\nscenarios may affect our CCAR stress\ntest results, which may impact the level\nof our SCB. For example, based on the\nresults of our 2022 CCAR stress test,\nthe Corporation\u2019s SCB increased to 3.4\npercent, and the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve could\nimpose limitations or prohibitions on\ntaking capital actions such as paying or\nincreasing dividends or repurchasing\ncommon stock. For example, as a result\nof the economic uncertainty resulting\nfrom the pandemic, in the second half of\n2020, the Federal Reserve introduced\ncertain limitations to capital\ndistributions for all large banks,\nincluding the Corporation, which were\nremoved effective July 1, 2021.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of\nour Banks are not \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or\n\u201cwell-managed,\u201d we would be required to\nenter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve to comply with all applicable\ncapital and management requirements,\nwhich may contain additional limitations\nor conditions relating to our\nactivities. Additionally, the applicable\nfederal regulatory authority is\nauthorized to determine, under certain\ncircumstances relating to the financial\ncondition of a bank or BHC, that the\npayment of dividends would be an unsafe\nor unsound practice and to prohibit\npayment thereof.\n\nFor more information regarding the\nrequirements relating to the payment of\ndividends, including the minimum capital\nrequirements, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity and Note 16 \u2013\nRegulatory Requirements and Restrictions\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. The\nrights of the Corporation, our\nshareholders and our creditors to\nparticipate in any distribution of the\nassets or earnings of our subsidiaries\nare further subject to the prior claims\nof creditors of the respective\nsubsidiaries.\n                                                                                  \n  Resolution Planning                                                             \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion\nof assets, the Corporation is required\nby the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to\nperiodically submit a plan for a rapid\nand orderly resolution in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure.\n\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a\ndetailed roadmap for the orderly\nresolution of the BHC, including the\ncontinued operations or solvent wind\ndown of its material entities, pursuant\nto the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or\nmore hypothetical scenarios assuming no\nextraordinary government assistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\ndetermine that the BHC\u2019s plan is not\ncredible, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC may jointly impose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on growth,\nactivities or operations. A summary of\nour plan is available on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of\na resolution plan for Bank of America,\nNational Association, which must\ndescribe how the insured depository\ninstitution would be resolved under the\nbank resolution provisions of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. A\ndescription of this plan is available on\nthe FDIC\u2019s website.\n\nWe continue to make substantial progress\nto enhance our resolvability, which\nincludes continued improvements to our\npreparedness capabilities to implement\nour resolution plan, both from a\nfinancial and operational standpoint.\n\nAcross international jurisdictions,\nresolution planning is the\nresponsibility of national resolution\nauthorities (RA). Among those, the\njurisdictions with the greatest impact\nto the Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries are\nthe U.K., Ireland and France, where\nrules have been issued requiring the\nsubmission of significant information\nabout locally incorporated subsidiaries\nas well as the Corporation\u2019s banking\nbranches located in those jurisdictions\nthat are deemed to be material for\nresolution planning purposes. As a\nresult of the RA's review of the\nsubmitted information, we could be\nrequired to take certain actions over\nthe next several years that could\nincrease operating costs and potentially\nresult in the restructuring of certain\nbusinesses and subsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Liquidity on page 9.\n                                                                                  \n  Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority                                \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nthe FDIC may be appointed receiver of an\ninsured depository institution if it is\ninsolvent or in certain other\ncircumstances. In addition, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nsystemically important financial\ninstitution (SIFI) such as the\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such institution. In the\nevent of such appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things, invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, instead\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury makes certain\nfinancial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. The orderly liquidation\nauthority is modeled in part on the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, but also\nadopts certain concepts from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nThe orderly liquidation authority\ncontains certain differences from the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in\ncertain circumstances, the FDIC could\npermit payment of obligations it\ndetermines to be systemically\nsignificant (e.g., short-term creditors\nor operating creditors) in lieu of\npaying other obligations (e.g., long-\nterm creditors) without the need to\nobtain creditors\u2019 consent or prior court\nreview. The insolvency and resolution\nprocess could also lead to a large\nreduction or total elimination of the\nvalue of a BHC\u2019s outstanding equity, as\nwell as impairment or elimination of\ncertain debt.\n\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC\ncould replace a distressed BHC with a\nbridge holding company, which could\ncontinue operations and result in an\norderly resolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity is held solely\nfor the benefit of creditors of the\noriginal BHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve\nrequires that BHCs maintain minimum\nlevels of long-term debt required to\nprovide adequate loss absorbing capacity\nin the event of a resolution.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution, see Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013\nLiquidity on page 9.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America6                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Limitations on Acquisitions                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits\na BHC to acquire banks located in states\nother than its home state without regard\nto state law, subject to certain\nconditions, including the condition that\nthe BHC, after and as a result of the\nacquisition, controls no more than 10\npercent of the total amount of deposits\nof insured depository institutions in\nthe U.S. and no more than 30 percent or\nsuch lesser or greater amount set by\nstate law of such deposits in that\nstate. At June 30, 2022, we held greater\nthan 10 percent of the total amount of\ndeposits of insured depository\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act\nrestricts acquisitions by a financial\ninstitution if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial institution would exceed\n10 percent of the total liabilities of\nall financial institutions in the U.S.\nAt June 30, 2022, our liabilities did\nnot exceed 10 percent of the total\nliabilities of all financial\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n                                                                                  \n  The Volcker Rule                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured\ndepository institutions and companies\naffiliated with insured depository\ninstitutions (collectively, banking\nentities) from engaging in short-term\nproprietary trading of certain\nsecurities, derivatives, commodity\nfutures and options for their own\naccount. The Volcker Rule also imposes\nlimits on banking entities\u2019 investments\nin, and other relationships with, hedge\nfunds and private equity funds. The\nVolcker Rule provides exemptions for\ncertain activities, including market\nmaking, underwriting, hedging, trading\nin government obligations, insurance\ncompany activities and organizing and\noffering hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies\nthat certain activities are not\nprohibited, including acting as agent,\nbroker or custodian. A banking entity\nwith significant trading operations,\nsuch as the Corporation, is required to\nmaintain a detailed compliance program\nto comply with the restrictions of the\nVolcker Rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivatives                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nOur derivatives operations are subject\nto extensive regulation globally. These\noperations are subject to regulation\nunder the Financial Reform Act, the\nEuropean Union (EU) Markets in Financial\nInstruments Directive and Regulation,\nthe European Market Infrastructure\nRegulation, analogous U.K. regulatory\nregimes and similar regulatory regimes\nin other jurisdictions that regulate or\nwill regulate the derivatives markets in\nwhich we operate by, among other things:\nrequiring clearing and exchange trading\nof certain derivatives; enforcing\nexisting or imposing new capital,\nmargin, reporting, registration and\nbusiness conduct requirements for\ncertain market participants; imposing\nposition limits on certain derivatives;\nand imposing derivatives trading\ntransparency requirements. These\nregulations are already in effect in\nmany markets in which we operate.\n\nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions,\nincluding the U.S., U.K., and Japan,\nhave adopted resolution stay regulations\nto address concerns that the close-out\nof derivatives and other financial\ncontracts in resolution could impede\norderly resolution of G-SIBs, and\nadditional jurisdictions are expected to\nfollow suit. In addition, the EU has\nimplemented EU-wide resolution stay\nrequirements. Generally, these\nresolution stay regulations require\namendment of certain financial contracts\nto provide for contractual recognition\nof stays of termination rights under\n\nvarious statutory resolution regimes and\na stay on the exercise of cross-default\nrights based on an affiliate\u2019s entry\ninto insolvency proceedings. Resolution\nregulations may also require contractual\nrecognition by the counterparty that\namounts owed may be written down or\nconverted into equity as part of a bail\nin. As resolution stay regulations of a\nparticular jurisdiction applicable to us\ngo into effect, we amend impacted\nfinancial contracts in compliance with\nsuch regulations either as a regulated\nentity or as a counterparty facing a\nregulated entity in such jurisdiction.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Regulations                                                            \n                                                                                  \nOur consumer businesses are subject to\nextensive regulation and oversight by\nfederal and state regulators.

The Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act requires us to\nperiodically disclose Bank of America\u2019s\nprivacy policies and practices relating\nto sharing such information and enables\nretail customers to opt out of our\nability to share information with\nunaffiliated third parties, under\ncertain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act and other laws also require\nus to implement a comprehensive\ninformation security program that\nincludes administrative, technical and\nphysical safeguards to provide the\nsecurity and confidentiality of customer\nrecords and information. Security and\nprivacy policies and procedures for the\nprotection of personal and confidential\ninformation are in effect across all\nbusinesses and geographic locations.\n\nOther laws and regulations, at the\ninternational, federal and state level,\nimpact our ability to share certain\ninformation with affiliates and non-\naffiliates for marketing and/or non-\nmarketing purposes, or contact customers\nwith marketing offers and establish\ncertain rights of consumers in\nconnection with their personal\ninformation. For example, California\u2019s\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as modified\nby the California Privacy Rights Act\n(CPRA), provides consumers with the\nright to know what personal data is\nbeing collected, know whether their\npersonal data is sold or disclosed and\nto whom and opt out of the sale of their\npersonal data, among other rights. In\naddition, in the EU, the General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) replaced\nthe Data Protection Directive and\nrelated implementing national laws in\nits member states. The CCPA's, CPRA's\nand GDPR\u2019s impact on the Corporation was\nassessed and addressed through\ncomprehensive compliance implementation\nprograms. These existing and evolving\nlegal requirements in the U.S. and\nabroad, as well as court proceedings and\nchanging guidance from regulatory bodies\nwith respect to the validity of cross-\nborder data transfer mechanisms from the\nEU, continue to lend uncertainty to\nprivacy compliance globally.\n                                                                                  \n  7Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1A.  Risk FactorsThe discussion below addresses our material risk        \u2502\n\u2502  factors of which we are aware. Any risk factor, either by itself or together  \u2502\n\u2502  with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our            \u2502\n\u2502  businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.     \u2502\n\u2502  References to third parties may include their upstream and downstream         \u2502\n\u2502  service providers who may also contribute to our risks. Other factors not     \u2502\n\u2502  currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also         \u2502\n\u2502  adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or     \u2502\n\u2502  financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be          \u2502\n\u2502  considered all of the potential risks that we may face. For more information  \u2502\n\u2502  on how we manage risks, see Managing Risk in the MD&A on page 46. For more    \u2502\n\u2502  information about the risks contained in the Risk Factors section, see Item   \u2502\n\u2502  1. Business on page 2, MD&A on page 26 and Notes to Consolidated Financial    \u2502\n\u2502  Statements on page 94.MarketWe may be adversely affected by the financial     \u2502\n\u2502  markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic              \u2502\n\u2502  conditions.General economic, political, social and health conditions in the   \u2502\n\u2502  U.S. and abroad affect financial markets and our business. In particular,     \u2502\n\u2502  global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest        \u2502\n\u2502  rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross      \u2502\n\u2502  domestic product (GDP), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation,     \u2502\n\u2502  supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor         \u2502\n\u2502  shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal      \u2502\n\u2502  government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property         \u2502\n\u2502  values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class  \u2502\n\u2502  of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets, fluctuations or   \u2502\n\u2502  other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and         \u2502\n\u2502  currencies, liquidity, the continued transition from InterBank Offered Rates  \u2502\n\u2502  (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the  \u2502\n\u2502  impact of volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the growth of   \u2502\n\u2502  global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of       \u2502\n\u2502  capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy     \u2502\n\u2502  infrastructure, recessionary fears and investor sentiment. Global markets,    \u2502\n\u2502  including energy and commodity markets, may be adversely affected by the      \u2502\n\u2502  current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic         \u2502\n\u2502  extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation    \u2502\n\u2502  of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military         \u2502\n\u2502  conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. Market fluctuations may    \u2502\n\u2502  impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. Any sudden or        \u2502\n\u2502  prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise,     \u2502\n\u2502  could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and   \u2502\n\u2502  adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition,           \u2502\n\u2502  including capital and liquidity levels. High inflation, elevated interest     \u2502\n\u2502  rate levels, supply chain disruptions, and the Russia/Ukraine conflict,       \u2502\n\u2502  including the related energy impact in Europe, have adversely impacted and    \u2502\n\u2502  may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic          \u2502\n\u2502  conditions and could result in additional market volatility and               \u2502\n\u2502  disruptions.Global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies       \u2502\n\u2502  present economic challenges. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve or other    \u2502\n\u2502  central banks, including changes in target rates, balance sheet management    \u2502\n\u2502  and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict,      \u2502\n\u2502  particularly in a high inflation environment. This can affect interest rates  \u2502\n\u2502  and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt         \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  securities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency     \u2502\n\u2502  rates and may also raise government debt levels, adversely affect businesses  \u2502\n\u2502  and household incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy.   \u2502\n\u2502  Monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant        \u2502\n\u2502  increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the    \u2502\n\u2502  yield curve. This has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility    \u2502\n\u2502  of equity and other markets, further volatility of the U.S. dollar, a         \u2502\n\u2502  widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary         \u2502\n\u2502  concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which could impact       \u2502\n\u2502  investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency  \u2502\n\u2502  rates. It is also possible that high inflation may limit the scope of         \u2502\n\u2502  monetary support, including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of   \u2502\n\u2502  an economic downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or  \u2502\n\u2502  inverted yield curve.Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal      \u2502\n\u2502  Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in     \u2502\n\u2502  lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net   \u2502\n\u2502  interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.      \u2502\n\u2502  Additionally, changes to existing U.S. laws and regulatory policies and       \u2502\n\u2502  evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation,         \u2502\n\u2502  taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including       \u2502\n\u2502  efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely  \u2502\n\u2502  impact U.S. or global economic activity and our customers', our               \u2502\n\u2502  counterparties' and our earnings and operations. Globally, many central       \u2502\n\u2502  banks are simultaneously reducing monetary accommodation through interest     \u2502\n\u2502  rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to       \u2502\n\u2502  contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and            \u2502\n\u2502  significant changes to asset values. While higher interest rates have         \u2502\n\u2502  positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have       \u2502\n\u2502  negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact deposits, loan    \u2502\n\u2502  demand and funding costs. If the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling limit is not  \u2502\n\u2502  raised, the ramifications could result in market volatility, ratings          \u2502\n\u2502  downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions.      \u2502\n\u2502  This could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the U.S. and      \u2502\n\u2502  world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest    \u2502\n\u2502  rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to  \u2502\n\u2502  U.S. debt, and a weakened U.S. dollar.Changes to international trade and      \u2502\n\u2502  investment policies by the U.S. could negatively impact financial markets.    \u2502\n\u2502  Escalation of tensions between the U.S. and the People\u2019s Republic of China    \u2502\n\u2502  (China) could lead to further U.S. measures that adversely affect financial   \u2502\n\u2502  markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation,      \u2502\n\u2502  including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the        \u2502\n\u2502  large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Any restrictions on the activities   \u2502\n\u2502  of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets.These           \u2502\n\u2502  developments could adversely affect our businesses, customers, securities     \u2502\n\u2502  and derivatives portfolios, including the risk of lower re-investment rates   \u2502\n\u2502  within those portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit    \u2502\n\u2502  losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels,    \u2502\n\u2502  our liquidity and our results of operations.Increased market volatility and   \u2502\n\u2502  adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our    \u2502\n\u2502  market risk.Our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of         \u2502\n\u2502  operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as       \u2502\n\u2502  changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity,      \u2502\n\u2502  commodity and futures prices, trading volumes and prices of securitized       \u2502\n\u2502  products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and     \u2502\n\u2502  other economic and                                                            \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America8                                                                \n                                                                                  \nbusiness factors. These market risks may\nadversely affect, among other things,\nthe value of our securities, including\nour on- and off-balance sheet\nsecurities, trading assets and other\nfinancial instruments, the cost of debt\ncapital and our access to credit\nmarkets, the value of assets under\nmanagement (AUM), fee income relating to\nAUM, customer allocation of capital\namong investment alternatives, the\nvolume of client activity in our trading\noperations, investment banking,\nunderwriting and other capital market\nfees, which have already been negatively\nimpacted, the general profitability and\nrisk level of the transactions in which\nwe engage and our competitiveness with\nrespect to deposit pricing. The value of\ncertain of our assets is sensitive to\nchanges in market interest rates. If the\nFederal Reserve or a non-U.S. central\nbank changes or signals a change in\nmonetary policy, market interest rates\nor credit spreads could be affected,\nwhich could adversely impact the value\nof such assets. Changes to fiscal\npolicy, including expansion of U.S.\nfederal deficit spending and resultant\ndebt issuance, could also affect market\ninterest rates. If interest rates\ndecrease, our results of operations\ncould be negatively impacted, including\nfuture revenue and earnings growth. The\ncontinued flattening and/or inversion of\nthe yield curve could also negatively\nimpact our results of operations,\nincluding revenue and earnings.\n\nOur models and strategies to assess and\ncontrol our market risk exposures are\nsubject to inherent limitations. In\ntimes of market stress or other\nunforeseen circumstances, previously\nuncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated and vice versa. Such changes\nto the relationship between market\nparameters may limit the effectiveness\nof our hedging strategies and cause us\nto incur significant losses. Changes in\ncorrelation can be exacerbated where\nmarket participants use risk or trading\nmodels with assumptions or algorithms\nsimilar to ours. In these and other\ncases, it may be difficult to reduce our\nrisk positions due to activity of other\nmarket participants or widespread market\ndislocations, including circumstances\nwhere asset values are declining\nsignificantly or no market exists. Where\nwe own securities that do not have an\nestablished liquid trading market or are\notherwise subject to restrictions on\nsale or hedging, or where the degree of\naccessible liquidity declines\nsignificantly, we may not be able to\nreduce our positions and risks\nassociated with such holdings, so we may\nsuffer larger than expected losses when\nadverse price movements take place. This\nrisk can be exacerbated where we hold a\nposition that is large relative to the\navailable liquidity.\n\nIf asset values decline, we may incur\nlosses and negative impacts to capital\nand liquidity requirements.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of financial\ninstruments, including loans and loan\ncommitments, securities financing\nagreements, asset-backed secured\nfinancings, derivative assets and\nliabilities, debt securities, marketable\nequity securities and certain other\nassets and liabilities that we measure\nat fair value and are subject to\nvaluation and impairment assessments. We\ndetermine these values based on\napplicable accounting guidance, which,\nfor financial instruments measured at\nfair value, requires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price and to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs\nin fair value measurements. The fair\nvalues of these financial instruments\ninclude adjustments for market\nliquidity, credit quality, funding\nimpact on certain derivatives and other\ntransaction-specific factors, where\nappropriate.\n\nGains or losses on these instruments can\nhave a direct impact on our results of\noperations, unless we have effectively\nhedged our exposures. Increases in\ninterest rates may result in further\ndecreases in residential mortgage loan\noriginations and could impact the\norigination of corporate debt. In\naddition,\n\nincreases in interest rates or changes\nin spreads may continue to adversely\nimpact the fair value of debt securities\nand, accordingly, for debt securities\nclassified as available for sale, may\ncontinue to adversely affect accumulated\nother comprehensive income and, thus,\ncapital levels. These market moves could\nalso adversely impact our regulatory\nliquidity requirements. Any decreases in\ninterest rates may increase prepayment\nspeeds of certain assets, and,\ntherefore, could adversely affect net\ninterest income. Changes in interest\nrates also may impact the value of\nmortgage service rights retained.\n\nFair values may be impacted by declining\nvalues of the underlying assets or the\nprices at which observable market\ntransactions occur and the continued\navailability of these transactions or\nindices. The financial strength of\ncounterparties, with whom we have\neconomically hedged some of our exposure\nto these assets, also will affect the\nfair value of these assets. Sudden\ndeclines and volatility in the prices of\nassets may curtail or eliminate trading\nactivities in these assets, which may\nmake it difficult to sell, hedge or\nvalue these assets. The inability to\nsell or effectively hedge assets reduces\nour ability to limit losses in such\npositions, and the difficulty in valuing\nassets may increase our risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), which requires us to\nmaintain additional capital and\nincreases our funding costs. Values of\nAUM also impact revenues in our wealth\nmanagement and related advisory\nbusinesses for asset-based management\nand performance fees. Declines in values\nof AUM can result in lower fees earned\nfor managing such assets.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nIf we are unable to access the capital\nmarkets, have prolonged net deposits\noutflows, or our borrowing costs\nincrease, our liquidity and competitive\nposition will be negatively affected.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our\nbusinesses. We fund our assets primarily\nwith globally sourced deposits in our\nbank entities, as well as secured and\nunsecured liabilities transacted in the\ncapital markets. We rely on certain\nsecured funding sources, such as repo\nmarkets, which are typically short-term\nand credit-sensitive. We also engage in\nasset securitization transactions,\nincluding with the government-sponsored\nenterprises (GSEs), to fund consumer\nlending activities. Our liquidity could\nbe adversely affected by any inability\nto access the capital markets,\nilliquidity or volatility in the capital\nmarkets, the decrease in value of\neligible collateral or increased\ncollateral requirements (including as a\nresult of credit concerns for short-term\nborrowing), changes to our relationships\nwith our funding providers based on real\nor perceived changes in our risk\nprofile, prolonged federal government\nshutdowns, or changes in regulations,\nguidance or GSE status that impact our\nfunding. Additionally, our liquidity or\ncost of funds may be negatively impacted\nby the unwillingness or inability of the\nFederal Reserve to act as lender of last\nresort, unexpected simultaneous draws on\nlines of credit, slower customer payment\nrates, restricted access to the assets\nof prime brokerage clients, the\nwithdrawal of or failure to attract\ncustomer deposits or invested funds\n(which could result from attrition\ndriven by customers seeking higher\nyielding deposits or securities\nproducts, customer desire to utilize an\nalternative financial institution\nperceived to be safer, changes in\ncustomer spending behavior due to\ninflation, decline in the economy or\nother drivers resulting in an increased\nneed for cash), increased regulatory\nliquidity, capital and margin\nrequirements for our U.S. or\ninternational banks and their nonbank\nsubsidiaries, which could result in the\ninability to transfer liquidity\ninternally and inefficient funding,\nchanges in patterns of intraday\nliquidity usage resulting from a\ncounterparty or technology failure or\nother idiosyncratic event or failure or\n                                                                                  \n  9Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \ndefault by a significant market\nparticipant or third party (including\nclearing agents, custodians, central\nbanks or central counterparty\nclearinghouses (CCPs)). These factors\nalso have the potential to increase our\nborrowing costs and negatively impact\nour liquidity.\n\nSeveral of these factors may arise due\nto circumstances beyond our control,\nsuch as general market volatility,\ndisruption, shock or stress, the\nemergence or continuation of widespread\nhealth emergencies or pandemics, Federal\nReserve policy decisions (including\nfluctuations in interest rates or\nFederal Reserve balance sheet\ncomposition), negative views or loss of\nconfidence about us or the financial\nservices industry generally or due to a\nspecific news event, changes in the\nregulatory environment or governmental\nfiscal or monetary policies, actions by\ncredit rating agencies or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties or\nus. The impact of these potentially\nsudden events, whether within our\ncontrol or not, could include an\ninability to sell assets or redeem\ninvestments, unforeseen outflows of\ncash, the need to draw on liquidity\nfacilities, the reduction of financing\nbalances and the loss of equity secured\nfunding, debt repurchases to support the\nsecondary market or meet client\nrequests, the need for additional\nfunding for commitments and\ncontingencies and unexpected collateral\ncalls, among other things, the result of\nwhich could be increased costs, a\nliquidity shortfall and/or impact on our\nliquidity coverage ratio.\n\nOur liquidity and cost of obtaining\nfunding may be directly related to\ninvestor behavior, debt market\ndisruption, firm specific concerns or\nprevailing market conditions, including\nchanges in interest and currency\nexchange rates, significant fluctuations\nin equity and futures prices, lower\ntrading volumes and prices of\nsecuritized products and our credit\nspreads. Increases in interest rates and\nour credit spreads can increase the cost\nof our funding and result in mark-to-\nmarket or credit valuation adjustment\nexposures. Changes in our credit spreads\nare market driven and may be influenced\nby market perceptions of our\ncreditworthiness, including changes in\nour credit ratings or changes in broader\nfinancial market and macroeconomic\nconditions. Changes to interest rates\nand our credit spreads occur\ncontinuously and may be unpredictable\nand highly volatile. We may also\nexperience net interest margin\ncompression as a result of offering\nhigher than expected deposit rates in\norder to attract and maintain deposits.\nConcentrations within our funding\nprofile, such as maturities, currencies\nor counterparties, can reduce our\nfunding efficiency.\n\nReduction in our credit ratings could\nlimit our access to funding or the\ncapital markets, increase borrowing\ncosts or trigger additional collateral\nor funding requirements.\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise\nfunds are directly impacted by our\ncredit ratings. Credit ratings may also\nbe important to investors, customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and seek to engage in\ncertain transactions, including over-\nthe-counter (OTC) derivatives. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by rating agencies, which\nconsider a number of financial and non-\nfinancial factors, including our\nfranchise, financial strength,\nperformance and prospects, management,\ngovernance, risk management practices,\ncapital adequacy, asset quality and\noperations, among other criteria, as\nwell as factors not under our control,\nsuch as regulatory developments, the\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment and changes to the\nmethodologies used to determine our\nratings, or ratings generally.\n\nRating agencies could make adjustments\nto our credit ratings at any time and\nthere can be no assurance as to whether\nor when any downgrades could occur. A\nreduction in our\n\ncredit ratings could result in a wider\ncredit spread and negatively affect our\nliquidity, access to credit markets, the\nrelated cost of funds, our businesses\nand certain trading revenues,\nparticularly in those businesses where\ncounterparty creditworthiness is\ncritical. If the short-term credit\nratings of our parent company, or bank\nor broker-dealer subsidiaries, were\ndowngraded by one or more levels, we may\nexperience loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing,\nand/or incur increased cost of funds and\nincreased collateral requirements. Under\nthe terms of certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements,\nif our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings are downgraded, the\ncounterparties may require additional\ncollateral or terminate these contracts\nor agreements.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nconsequences of a credit rating\ndowngrade are inherently uncertain and\ndepend upon numerous dynamic, complex\nand inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including the relationship\nbetween long-term and short-term credit\nratings and the behaviors of customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.\n\nBank of America Corporation is a holding\ncompany, is dependent on its\nsubsidiaries for liquidity and may be\nrestricted from transferring funds from\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America Corporation, as the\nparent company, is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and\nmanage liquidity on a legal entity\nbasis. Legal entity liquidity is an\nimportant consideration as there are\nlegal, regulatory, contractual and other\nlimitations on our ability to utilize\nliquidity from one legal entity to\nsatisfy the liquidity requirements of\nanother, including the parent company,\nwhich could result in adverse liquidity\nevents. The parent company depends on\ndividends, distributions, loans and\nother payments from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries to fund dividend payments\non our preferred stock and common stock\nand to fund all payments on our other\nobligations, including debt obligations.\nAny inability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds, pay dividends or make\npayments to us may adversely affect our\ncash flow and financial condition.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. Our bank\nand broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to restrictions on their ability\nto lend or transact with affiliates,\nminimum regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements and restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited with them\nin bank or brokerage accounts to fund\ntheir businesses. Intercompany\narrangements we entered into in\nconnection with our resolution planning\nsubmissions could restrict the amount of\nfunding available to the parent company\nfrom our subsidiaries under certain\nadverse conditions.\n\nAdditional restrictions on related party\ntransactions, increased capital and\nliquidity requirements and additional\nlimitations on the use of funds on\ndeposit in bank or brokerage accounts,\nas well as lower earnings, can reduce\nthe amount of funds available to meet\nthe obligations of the parent company\nand even require the parent company to\nprovide additional funding to such\nsubsidiaries. Also, regulatory action\nthat requires additional liquidity at\neach of our subsidiaries could impede\naccess to funds we need to pay our\nobligations or pay dividends. In\naddition, our right to participate in a\ndistribution of assets upon a\nsubsidiary\u2019s liquidation or\nreorganization is subject to prior\nclaims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America10                                                               \n                                                                                  \nBank of America Corporation\u2019s liquidity\nand financial condition, and the ability\nto pay dividends and obligations, could\nbe adversely affected in the event of a\nresolution.\n\nBank of America Corporation, our parent\nholding company, is required to\nperiodically submit a plan to the FDIC\nand Federal Reserve describing its\nresolution strategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. Bank of\nAmerica Corporation\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy is a \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy, whereby only the\nparent holding company would file for\nbankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. Certain key operating subsidiaries\nwould be provided with sufficient\ncapital and liquidity to operate through\nsevere stress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue operating or be\nwound down in a solvent manner following\na bankruptcy of the parent holding\ncompany. Bank of America Corporation has\nentered into intercompany arrangements\nresulting in the contribution of most of\nits capital and liquidity to key\nsubsidiaries. Pursuant to these\narrangements, if Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nbecomes imminent, it will no longer be\nable to draw liquidity from its key\nsubsidiaries and will be required to\ncontribute its remaining financial\nassets to a wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary. This could adversely affect\nour liquidity and financial condition,\nincluding the ability to meet our\npayment obligations and the ability to\nreturn capital to shareholders,\nincluding through the payment of\ndividends and repurchase of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock.\n\nIf the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly\ndetermine that Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s resolution plan is not\ncredible, they could impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or operations. We\ncould also be required to take certain\nactions that could impose operating\ncosts and result in the divestiture of\nassets or restructuring of businesses\nand subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a G-SIB such as Bank of America\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver to conduct an orderly\nliquidation, and could, among other\nthings, invoke the orderly liquidation\nauthority, instead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the\nTreasury makes certain financial\ndistress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. Additionally, the FDIC\ncould replace Bank of America\nCorporation with a bridge holding\ncompany, which could continue operations\nand result in an orderly resolution of\nthe underlying bank, but whose equity\nwould be held solely for the benefit of\nour creditors. The FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy may result in our\nsecurity holders suffering greater\nlosses than would have been the case\nunder a bankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution strategy.\n\nIf the Corporation is resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or the FDIC\u2019s\norderly liquidation authority, third-\nparty creditors of the Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries may receive significant or\nfull recoveries on their claims while\nsecurity holders of Bank of America\nCorporation could face significant or\ncomplete losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nEconomic or market disruptions and\ninsufficient credit loss reserves may\nresult in a higher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nA number of our products expose us to\ncredit risk, including loans, letters of\ncredit, derivatives, debt securities,\ntrading account assets and assets held-\nfor-sale. Deterioration in the financial\ncondition of our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nOur credit portfolios may be impacted by\nU.S. and global macroeconomic and market\nconditions, events and disruptions,\n\nincluding declines in GDP, consumer\nspending or property values, asset price\ncorrections, increasing consumer and\ncorporate leverage, increases in\ncorporate bond spreads, government\nshutdowns, tax changes, rising or\nelevated unemployment levels, inflation,\nfluctuations in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates, as well as the emergence\nor continuation of widespread health\nemergencies or pandemics, extreme\nweather events and the impacts of\nclimate change, including acute and/or\nchronic extreme weather events and\nefforts to transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Significant economic or market\nstresses and disruptions typically have\na negative impact on the business\nenvironment and financial markets, which\ncould impact the underlying credit\nquality of our borrowers, counterparties\nand assets. Property value declines or\nasset price corrections could increase\nthe risk of borrowers or counterparties\ndefaulting or becoming delinquent in\ntheir obligations to us, and could\ndecrease the value of the collateral we\nhold, which could increase credit\nlosses. Credit risk could also be\nmagnified by lending to leveraged\nborrowers or declining asset prices,\nincluding property or collateral values,\nunrelated to macroeconomic stress.\nSimultaneous drawdowns on lines of\ncredit and/or an increase in a\nborrower\u2019s leverage in a weakening\neconomic environment, or otherwise,\ncould result in deterioration in our\ncredit portfolio, should borrowers be\nunable to fulfill competing financial\nobligations. Increased delinquency and\ndefault rates could adversely affect our\ncredit portfolios, including consumer\ncredit card, home equity and residential\nmortgage portfolios through increased\ncharge-offs and provisions for credit\nlosses.\n\nA recessionary environment and/or a rise\nin unemployment could adversely impact\nthe ability of our consumer and/or\ncommercial borrowers or counterparties\nto meet their financial obligations and\nnegatively impact our credit portfolio.\nConsumers have been and may continue to\nbe negatively impacted by inflation,\nresulting in drawdowns of savings or\nincreases in household debt. Higher\ninterest rates, which have increased\ndebt servicing costs for some businesses\nand households, may adversely impact\ncredit quality, particularly in a\nrecessionary environment. Certain\nsectors also remain at risk (e.g.,\ncommercial real estate office exposure,\nconsumer discretionary industries) as a\nresult of shifts in demand from the\npandemic. Globally, conditions of slow\ngrowth or recession could further\ncontribute to weaker credit conditions.\nIf the macroeconomic environment\nworsens, our credit portfolio and\nallowance for credit losses could be\nadversely impacted.\n\nWe establish an allowance for credit\nlosses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments, based\non management's best estimate of\nlifetime expected credit losses (ECL)\ninherent in our relevant financial\nassets. The process to determine the\nallowance for credit losses uses models\nand assumptions that require us to make\ndifficult and complex judgments that are\noften interrelated, including\nforecasting how borrowers or\ncounterparties may perform in changing\neconomic conditions. The ability of our\nborrowers or counterparties to repay\ntheir obligations may be impacted by\nchanges in future economic conditions,\nwhich in turn could impact the accuracy\nof our loss forecasts and allowance\nestimates. There is also the possibility\nthat we have failed or will fail to\naccurately identify the appropriate\neconomic indicators or accurately\nestimate their impacts to our borrowers\nor counterparties, which could impact\nthe accuracy of our loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates.\n\nIf the models, estimates and assumptions\nwe use to establish reserves or the\njudgments we make in extending credit to\nour borrowers or counterparties, which\nare more sensitive\n                                                                                  \n  11Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndue to the current uncertain\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment, prove inaccurate in\npredicting future events, we may suffer\nlosses in excess of our ECL. In\naddition, changes to external factors\ncan negatively impact our recognition of\ncredit losses in our portfolios and\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is our\nbest estimate of ECL; however, there is\nno guarantee that it will be sufficient\nto address credit losses, particularly\nif the economic outlook deteriorates\nsignificantly and quickly, or\nunexpectedly. As circumstances change,\nwe may increase our allowance, which\nwould reduce our earnings. If economic\nconditions worsen, impacting our\nconsumer and commercial borrowers,\ncounterparties or underlying collateral,\nand credit losses are worse than\nexpected, we may increase our provision\nfor credit losses, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nOur concentrations of credit risk could\nadversely affect our credit losses,\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nWe may be subject to concentrations of\ncredit risk because of a common\ncharacteristic or common sensitivity to\neconomic, financial, public health or\nbusiness developments. Concentrations of\ncredit risk may reside in a particular\nindustry, geography, product, asset\nclass, counterparty or within any pool\nof exposures with a common risk\ncharacteristic. A deterioration in the\nfinancial condition or prospects of a\nparticular industry, geographic\nlocation, product or asset class, or a\nfailure or downgrade of, or default by,\nany particular entity or group of\nentities could negatively affect our\nbusinesses, and it is possible our\nlimits and credit monitoring exposure\ncontrols will not function as\nanticipated.\n\nWe execute a high volume of transactions\nand have significant credit\nconcentrations with respect to the\nfinancial services industry,\npredominantly comprised of broker-\ndealers, commercial banks, investment\nbanks, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds, hedge funds, CCPs and other\ninstitutional clients. Financial\nservices institutions and other\ncounterparties are inter-related because\nof trading, funding, clearing or other\nrelationships. Defaults by one or more\ncounterparties, or market uncertainty\nabout the financial stability of one or\nmore financial services institutions, or\nthe financial services industry\ngenerally, could lead to market-wide\nliquidity disruptions, losses, defaults\nand related disputes and litigation.\n\nOur credit risk may also be heightened\nby market risk when the collateral held\nby us cannot be liquidated or is\nliquidated at prices not sufficient to\nrecover the full amount of the loan or\nderivatives exposure due to us, which\nmay occur as a result of events that\nimpact the value of the collateral, such\nas an asset price correction or fraud.\nDisputes with obligors as to the\nvaluation of collateral could increase\nin times of significant market stress,\nvolatility or illiquidity, and we could\nsuffer losses during such periods if we\nare unable to realize the fair value of\nthe collateral or manage declines in the\nvalue of collateral.\n\nWe have concentrations of credit risk\nwith respect to our consumer real estate\nand consumer credit card, and our\ncommercial real estate and asset\nmanagers and funds portfolios, which\nrepresent a significant percentage of\nour overall credit portfolio. Declining\nhome price valuations and demand where\nwe have large concentrations could\nresult in increased servicing advances\nand expenses, defaults, delinquencies or\ncredit losses. The impacts of\nearthquakes, as well as climate change,\nsuch as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and the\nincreasing frequency and severity of\nextreme weather events and natural\ndisasters, including droughts, floods,\nwildfires and hurricanes, could\nnegatively impact collateral, the\nvaluations of home or\n\ncommercial real estate or our customers\u2019\nability and/or willingness to pay fees,\noutstanding loans or afford new\nproducts. This could also cause\ninsurability risk and/or increased\ninsurance costs to customers.\n\nEconomic weaknesses, sustained elevated\ninflation, adverse business conditions,\nmarket disruptions, adverse economic or\nmarket events, rising interest or\ncapitalization rates, declining asset\nprices, greater volatility in areas\nwhere we have concentrated credit risk\nor deterioration in real estate values\nor household incomes may cause us to\nexperience a decrease in cash flow and\nhigher credit losses in our portfolios\nor cause us to write down the value of\ncertain assets. We could also experience\ncontinued and long-term negative impacts\nto our commercial credit exposure and an\nincrease in credit losses within those\nindustries that may be permanently\nimpacted by a change in consumer\npreferences resulting from COVID-19\n(e.g., commercial real estate exposure)\nor other industry disruptions.\n\nWe also enter into transactions with\nsovereign nations, U.S. states and\nmunicipalities. Unfavorable economic or\npolitical conditions (such as those\narising from the Russia/Ukraine\nconflict), disruptions to capital\nmarkets, currency fluctuations, changes\nin oil prices, social instability and\nchanges in government or monetary\npolicies could adversely impact the\noperating budgets or credit ratings of\nthese government entities and expose us\nto credit and liquidity risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may result in our inability to\nsell, syndicate or realize the value of\nour positions, increasing\nconcentrations, which could increase RWA\nand the credit and market risk\nassociated with our positions.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by\nweaknesses in the U.S. housing market.\n\nU.S. home prices declined and housing\ndemand slowed in the second half of\n2022, including in certain markets where\nwe have large concentrations of loans,\ndriven in part by higher mortgage rates,\nincluding 30-year fixed-rate mortgages\nthat more than doubled from 2021. This\nhas negatively impacted the demand in\nsome cases and underlying collateral for\nmany of our products. Additionally, our\nmortgage loan production volume is\ngenerally influenced by the rate of\ngrowth in residential mortgage debt\noutstanding and the size of the\nresidential mortgage market, both of\nwhich have slowed due to rising interest\nrates and reduced affordability. A\ndeeper downturn in the condition of the\nU.S. housing market could result in both\nsignificant write-downs of asset values\nin several asset classes, notably\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS). If the\nU.S. housing market were to further\nweaken, the value of real estate could\ndecline, which could result in increased\ncredit losses and delinquent servicing\nexpenses, negatively affect our\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nOur derivatives businesses may expose us\nto unexpected risks and potential\nlosses.\n\nWe are party to a large number of\nderivatives transactions that may expose\nus to unexpected market, credit and\noperational risks that could cause us to\nsuffer unexpected losses. Severe\ndeclines in asset values or an\nunanticipated credit event, including\nunforeseen circumstances that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to\nbecome correlated and vice versa, may\ncreate losses resulting from risks not\nappropriately taken into account or\nanticipated in the development,\nstructuring or pricing of a derivative\ninstrument. Certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements\nprovide that upon the occurrence of\ncertain specified events, such as a\nchange to our or our affiliates\u2019 credit\nratings, we may be required to provide\nadditional collateral or take other\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America12                                                               \n                                                                                  \nremedial actions, and we could\nexperience increased difficulty\nobtaining funding or hedging risks. In\nsome cases our counterparties may have\nthe right to terminate or otherwise\ndiminish our rights under these\ncontracts or agreements.\n\nWe are also a member of various CCPs,\nwhich potentially increases our credit\nrisk exposures to those CCPs. In the\nevent that one or more members of a CCP\ndefault on their obligations, we may be\nrequired to pay a portion of any losses\nincurred by the CCP as a result of that\ndefault. A CCP may also, at its\ndiscretion, modify the margin we are\nrequired to post, which could mean\nunexpected and increased funding costs\nand exposure to that CCP. As a clearing\nmember, we are exposed to the risk of\nnon-performance by our clients for which\nwe clear transactions, which may not be\ncovered by available collateral.\nAdditionally, default by a significant\nmarket participant may result in further\nrisk and potential losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Geopolitical                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to numerous political,\neconomic, market, reputational,\noperational, compliance, legal,\nregulatory and other risks in the\njurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe do business throughout the world,\nincluding in emerging markets. Economic\nor geopolitical stress in one or more\ncountries could have a negative impact\nregionally or globally, resulting in,\namong other things, market volatility,\nreduced market value and economic\noutput. Our liquidity and credit risk\ncould be adversely impacted by, and our\nbusinesses and revenues derived from\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to,\nrisk of loss from financial, social or\njudicial instability, economic\nsanctions, changes in government\nleadership, including as a result of\nelectoral outcomes or otherwise, changes\nin governmental policies or policies of\ncentral banks, expropriation,\nnationalization and/or confiscation of\nassets, price controls, high inflation,\nnatural disasters, the emergence or\ncontinuation of widespread health\nemergencies or pandemics, capital\ncontrols, currency re-denomination risk\nfrom a country exiting the EU or\notherwise, currency fluctuations,\nforeign exchange controls or movements\n(caused by devaluation or de-pegging),\nunfavorable political and diplomatic\ndevelopments, oil price fluctuations and\nchanges in legislation. These risks are\nespecially elevated in emerging markets.\n\nContinued tensions between the U.S. and\nimportant trading partners, particularly\nChina, may result in sanctions, further\ntariff increases or other restrictive\nactions on cross-border trade,\ninvestment, and transfer of information\ntechnology that weigh on trade volumes,\nraise costs for producers, and adversely\naffect our businesses and revenues, as\nwell as our customers and\ncounterparties, including their credit\nquality.\n\nSlowing growth, recessionary conditions,\nmarket volatility and/or political or\ncivil unrest, global supply chain\ndisruptions, labor shortages, wage\npressures and elevated inflation in many\ncountries pose additional challenges,\nincluding in the form of volatility in\nfinancial markets. Foreign exchange\nrates against the U.S. dollar remain an\narea of uncertainty and potential\nvolatility as the Federal Reserve and\nother central banks raise interest\nrates, and depreciation could increase\nour financial risks with clients that\ndeal in non-U.S. currencies but have\nU.S. dollar-denominated debt.\n\nWe invest or trade in the securities of\ncorporations and governments located in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions, including\nemerging markets. Revenues from the\ntrading of non-U.S. securities may be\nsubject to negative fluctuations as a\nresult of the above factors.\nFurthermore, the impact of these\nfluctuations could be magnified because\nnon-U.S. trading markets, particularly\nin emerging markets, are generally\nsmaller, less\n\nliquid and more volatile than U.S.\ntrading markets. Risks in one nation can\nlimit our opportunities for portfolio\ngrowth and negatively affect our\noperations in other nations, including\nour U.S. operations. Market and economic\ndisruptions may affect consumer\nconfidence levels and spending,\ncorporate investment and job creation,\nbankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence\nand default on consumer and corporate\ndebt, economic growth rates and asset\nvalues, among other factors.\n\nElevated government debt levels raise\nthe risk of volatility, significant\nvaluation changes, political tensions\namong EU members regarding fiscal policy\nor defaults on or devaluation of\nsovereign debt, which could expose us to\nsubstantial losses. Financial markets\nhave been and may continue to be\nsensitive to government plans to lower\ntaxes or increase spending.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by governments,\nsecurities exchanges and regulators,\ncentral banks and other regulatory\nbodies. In many countries, the laws and\nregulations applicable to the financial\nservices and securities industries are\nless predictable, prone to change and\nuncertainty and evolving, and it may be\ndifficult to determine the requirements\nof local laws in every market or manage\nour relationships with multiple\nregulators in various jurisdictions.\nSignificant resources are spent on\nunderstanding and monitoring foreign\nlaws, rules and regulations. Our\ninability to remain in compliance with\nlocal laws and manage our relationships\nwith regulators could result in\nincreased expenses, changes to our\norganizational structure and adversely\naffect our businesses, reputation and\nresults of operations in that market.\n\nWe are also subject to complex and\nextensive U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules\nand regulations, which subject us to\ncosts and risks relating to bribery and\ncorruption, anti-money laundering,\nembargo programs and economic sanctions,\nwhich can vary by jurisdiction and\nrequire implementation of complex\noperational capabilities and compliance\nprograms. Non-compliance and/or\nviolations could result in an increase\nin operational and compliance costs, and\nenforcement actions and civil and\ncriminal penalties against us and\nindividual employees. The increasing\nspeed and novel ways in which funds\ncirculate could make it more challenging\nto track the movement of funds and\nheighten financial crimes risk.\nCompliance with these evolving\nregulatory regimes and legal\nrequirements depends on our ability to\nimprove our processes, controls,\nsurveillance, detection and reporting\nand analytic capabilities.\n\nIn connection with the U.K.\u2019s exit from\nthe EU, we are now subject to different\nlaws and regulations, which are expected\nto diverge further over time, and are\nsubject to the oversight of additional\nregulatory authorities. As political and\nregulatory environments evolve, further\nchanges to the legal and regulatory\nframework under which our subsidiaries\nprovide products and services in the\nU.K. and in the EU may result in\nadditional compliance costs and have\nnegative tax consequences or an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\n\nIn the U.S., the government\u2019s debt\nceiling and budget deficit concerns have\nincreased the possibility of U.S.\ngovernment defaults on its debt and/or\ndowngrades to its credit ratings, and\nprolonged government shutdowns, which\ncould weaken the U.S. dollar, cause\nmarket volatility, negatively impact the\nglobal economy and banking system and\nadversely affect our financial\ncondition, including our liquidity.\nAdditionally, changes in fiscal,\nmonetary or regulatory policy, including\nas a result of labor shortages, wage\npressures, supply chain disruptions and\nhigher inflation, could increase our\ncompliance costs and adversely affect\nour business operations, organizational\nstructure and results of operations.\nMonetary policy has contributed to a\nsignificant depreciation of many foreign\ncurrencies over the past\n                                                                                  \n  13Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nyear. Emerging markets are particularly\nvulnerable to tighter U.S. monetary\npolicy, and many have responded by\ntightening monetary policy and\nintervening in foreign exchange markets.\nFurther monetary tightening by the\nFederal Reserve risks creating\nadditional currency volatility and\nrecessionary conditions in a number of\nnon-U.S. markets.\n\nWe are also subject to geopolitical\nrisks, including economic sanctions,\nacts or threats of international or\ndomestic terrorism, including responses\nby the U.S. or other governments\nthereto, increased risk of state-\nsponsored cyberattacks or campaigns,\ncivil unrest and/or military conflicts,\nincluding the escalation of tensions\nbetween China and Taiwan, which could\nadversely affect business, market trade\nand general economic conditions abroad\nand in the U.S. The Russia/Ukraine\nconflict has magnified such risks and\nresulted in regional instability and\nadversely impacted commodity and other\nfinancial markets, as well as economic\nconditions, especially in Europe where\nthere is significant risk of recession\nin some countries. The disruption of\nenergy supplies and other goods and\nsanctions have contributed to\ninflationary pressures in Europe and\nother regions, which has resulted in\ngreater monetary tightening by\npolicymakers, and could adversely impact\nthe profitability of businesses and our\ncredit risk. Military escalation\nresulting in the involvement of\nneighboring countries and/or North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization member\ncountries or new sanctions could result\nin additional economic disruptions,\nfinancial market volatility, and changes\nto asset valuations, which could disrupt\nour operations and adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Business Operations                                                             \n                                                                                  \nA failure in or breach of our\noperational or security systems or\ninfrastructure, or those of third\nparties or the financial services\nindustry, could cause disruptions,\nadversely impact our results of\noperations and financial condition, and\ncause legal or reputational harm.\n\nOperational risk exposure exists\nthroughout our organization and as a\nresult of our interactions with, and\nreliance on, third parties and the\nfinancial services industry\ninfrastructure. Our operational and\nsecurity systems infrastructure,\nincluding our computer systems, emerging\ntechnologies, data management and\ninternal processes and controls, as well\nas those of third parties, are integral\nto our performance.\n\nOur financial, accounting, data\nprocessing and transmission, storage,\nbackup and other operating or security\nsystems and infrastructure, or those of\nthird parties, may be ineffective or\nfail to operate properly or become\ndisabled or damaged as a result of a\nnumber of factors, including events that\nare wholly or partially beyond our or\nsuch third party\u2019s control, which could\nadversely affect our ability to process\ntransactions or provide services.\nProlonged disruptions to our critical\nbusiness operations and customer\nservices are possible due to computer,\ntelecommunications, network, utility,\nelectronic or physical infrastructure\noutages, including from abuse or failure\nof our electronic trading and\nalgorithmic platforms, significant\nunplanned increases in customer\ntransactions, newly identified\nvulnerabilities in key hardware and\nsoftware, failure of aging\ninfrastructure or manual processes,\nretired or redundant software and/or\nhardware, technology project\nimplementation challenges and supply\nchain disruptions. Operational\ndisruptions and prolonged operational\noutages could also result from events\narising from natural disasters,\nincluding acute and chronic weather\nevents, such as wildfires, tornadoes,\nhurricanes and floods, some of which are\nhappening with more frequency and\nseverity, and earthquakes, as well as\nlocal or larger scale\n\npolitical or social matters, including\ncivil unrest, terrorist acts and\nmilitary conflict.\n\nWe continue to have greater reliance on\nremote access tools and technology and\nemployees\u2019 personal systems (and our\nthird parties\u2019 employees\u2019 personal\nsystems) and increased data utilization\nand are increasingly dependent upon our\ninformation technology infrastructure to\noperate our businesses remotely due to\nthe increased number of employees who\nwork from home and evolving customer\npreferences, including increased\nreliance on digital banking and other\ndigital services provided by our\nbusinesses. Effective management of our\nbusiness continuity increasingly depends\non the security, reliability and\nadequacy of such systems.\n\nWe also rely on our employees,\nrepresentatives and third parties in our\nday-to-day operations, who may, due to\nillness, unavailability, human error,\nmisconduct (including errors in\njudgment, malice, fraudulent or illegal\nactivity), malfeasance or a failure or\nbreach of systems or infrastructure\ncause disruptions to our organization\nand expose us to operational losses,\nregulatory risk and reputational harm.\nOur and our third parties\u2019 inability to\nproperly introduce, deploy and manage\nchanges to internal financial and\ngovernance processes, existing products,\nservices and technology, and new product\ninnovations and technology could also\nresult in additional operational and\nregulatory risk.\n\nRegardless of the measures we have taken\nto implement training, procedures,\nbackup systems and other safeguards to\nsupport our operations and bolster our\noperational resilience, our ability to\nconduct business may be adversely\naffected by significant disruptions to\nus or to third parties with whom we\ninteract or upon whom we rely, including\nsystemic cyber events that result in\nsystem outages and unavailability of\npart or all of the internet, cloud\nservices and/or the financial services\nindustry infrastructure (including\nelectronic trading platforms and\ncritical banking activities). Our\nability to implement backup systems and\nother safeguards with respect to third-\nparty systems and the financial services\nindustry infrastructure is more limited\nthan with our own systems.\n\nAny backup systems may not process data\nas quickly as our primary systems and\nsome data might not have been backed up.\nWe regularly update the systems we rely\non to support our operations and growth\nand to remain compliant with all\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nglobally. This updating entails\nsignificant costs and creates risks\nassociated with implementing new systems\nand integrating them with existing ones,\nincluding business interruptions.\n\nA failure or breach of our operational\nor security systems or infrastructure\nresulting in disruption to our critical\nbusiness operations and customer\nservices and/or failure to identify,\neffectively respond to operational risks\nin a timely manner, and continue to\ndeliver our services through an\noperational disruption could expose us\nto a number of risks, including market\nabuse, regulatory, market, privacy and\nliquidity risk, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition, and cause legal or\nreputational harm.\n\nA cyberattack, information or security\nbreach, or a technology failure of ours\nor of a third party could adversely\naffect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness, result in the misuse or\ndisclosure of information, result in\nadditional costs, damage to our\nreputation, increase our regulatory and\nlegal risks and cause financial losses.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the\nsecurity, controls and efficacy of our\ninfrastructure, computer and data\nmanagement systems, and those of our\ncustomers, suppliers, counterparties and\nother third parties, the financial\nservices\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America14                                                               \n                                                                                  \nindustry and financial data aggregators,\nwith whom we interact, on whom we rely\nor who have access to our customers'\npersonal or account information. We rely\non effective access management and the\nsecure collection, processing,\ntransmission, storage and retrieval of\nconfidential, proprietary, personally\nidentifiable and other information in\nour and our third parties\u2019 computer and\ndata management systems and networks.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk and exposure\nremains heightened because of, among\nother things, our prominent size and\nscale, high-profile brand, geographic\nfootprint and international presence and\nrole in the financial services industry\nand the broader economy. The\nproliferation of third-party financial\ndata aggregators and emerging\ntechnologies, including our use of\nautomation, artificial intelligence (AI)\nand robotics, increase our cybersecurity\nrisks and exposure.\n\nWe, our employees, customers, regulators\nand third parties are regularly the\ntarget of an increasing number of cyber\nthreats and attacks. Cyber threats and\ntechniques used in cyberattacks are\npervasive, sophisticated and difficult\nto prevent, including computer viruses,\nmalicious or destructive code (such as\nransomware), social engineering\n(including phishing, vishing and\nsmishing), denial of service or\ninformation or other security breach\ntactics that could result in disruptions\nto our businesses and operations, the\nloss of our funds and/or our clients\u2019\nand the unauthorized disclosure,\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, misuse,\nloss or destruction or theft of\nconfidential, proprietary and other\ninformation, including intellectual\nproperty, of ours, our employees, our\ncustomers or of third parties.\nCyberattacks may be carried out on a\nworldwide scale and by a growing number\nof cyber actors, including organized\ncrime groups, hackers, terrorist\norganizations, extremist parties,\nhostile foreign governments, state-\nsponsored actors, activists, disgruntled\nemployees and other third parties,\nincluding those involved in corporate\nespionage.\n\nCyber threats and the techniques used in\ncyberattacks change, develop and evolve\nrapidly, including from emerging\ntechnologies, such as advanced forms of\nAI and quantum computing. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to protect the\nintegrity and resilience of our systems\nand implement controls, processes,\npolicies, employee training and other\nprotective measures, we may not be able\nto anticipate or detect cyberattacks or\ninformation or security breaches and/or\ndevelop or implement effective\npreventive or defensive measures to\naddress or mitigate such attacks or\nbreaches. Internal access management\nfailures could result in the compromise\nor unauthorized exposure of confidential\ndata. Additionally, the failure of our\nemployees to exercise sound judgment and\nvigilance when targeted with social\nengineering cyberattacks may increase\nour vulnerability.\n\nOur risk and exposure to cyberattacks\nand security breaches continue to\nincrease due to the acceptance and use\nof digital banking products and\nservices, including mobile banking\nproducts, and reliance on remote access\ntools and technology, which have\nincreased our reliance on\nvirtual/digital interactions and a\nlarger number of access points to our\nnetworks that must be secured. This\nincreased risk of unauthorized access to\nour networks results in greater amounts\nof information being available for\naccess. Employees working remotely away\nfrom the office (whether on personal or\nour devices) also represent inherently\ngreater risk than employees working in\nour offices. Greater demand on our\ninformation technology infrastructure\nand security tools and processes will\nlikely continue.\n\nWe also face indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and operational risks\nrelating to the customers, clients and\nother\n\nthird parties with whom we do business\nand the financial services industry,\nupon whom we rely to facilitate or\nenable our business activities or upon\nwhom our customers rely. Other indirect\nrisks relate to providers of products\nand/or services, financial\ncounterparties, financial data\naggregators, financial intermediaries,\nsuch as clearing agents, exchanges and\nclearing houses, regulators, providers\nof critical infrastructure, such as\ninternet access and electrical power,\nand retailers for whom we process\ntransactions. We are also at additional\nrisk resulting from critical third-party\ninformation security and open-source\nsoftware vulnerabilities.\n\nWe have exposure to cyber threats due to\nour continuous transmission of sensitive\ninformation to, and storage of such\ninformation by, third parties, including\nproviders of products and/or services,\nand regulators, the outsourcing of some\nof our business operations, and system\nand customer account updates and\nconversions. Further, any such event may\nnot be disclosed to us in a timely\nmanner. Any failure, cyberattack or\nother information or security breach\nthat significantly degrades, deletes or\ncompromises our systems or data could\nadversely impact third parties,\ncounterparties and the critical\ninfrastructure of the financial services\nindustry.\n\nDue to increasing consolidation,\ninterdependence and complexity of\nfinancial entities and technology\nsystems, a technology failure,\ncyberattack or other information or\nsecurity vulnerability, failure or\nbreach that significantly exposes,\ndegrades, deletes or compromises the\nsystems or data of one or more financial\nentities or third parties could\nadversely impact us and increase the\nrisk of operational failure, as\ndisparate systems need to be integrated,\noften on an accelerated basis.\n\nCyberattacks or security breaches could\npersist for an extended period of time\nbefore being detected and take\nadditional time to determine the scope,\nextent, amount, and type of information\ncompromised, following which the impact\nand measures to recover and restore to a\nbusiness-as-usual state may be difficult\nto assess. We continue to expend\nsignificant additional money and\nresources to modify or enhance our\nprotective measures, investigate and\nremediate any information security,\nsoftware or network vulnerabilities or\nincidents whether specific to us, a\nthird party, the industry or businesses\nin general, and develop our capabilities\nto respond and recover.\n\nWhile we have experienced cyberattacks\nand security breaches, and expect to\ncontinue to, we have not experienced any\nmaterial losses or other material\nconsequences relating to technology\nfailure, cyberattacks or other\ninformation or security breaches,\nwhether directed at us or third parties.\nThere can be no assurance that our\ncontrols and procedures in place to\nmonitor and mitigate the risks of cyber\nthreats, including the remediation of\ncritical information security and\nsoftware vulnerabilities, will be\nsufficient and/or timely and that we\nwill not suffer material losses or\nconsequences in the future. Successful\npenetration or circumvention of system\nsecurity could result in negative\nconsequences, including loss of\ncustomers and business opportunities,\nthe withdrawal of customer deposits,\nmisappropriation or destruction of our\nintellectual property, proprietary\ninformation or confidential information\nand/or the confidential, proprietary or\npersonally identifiable information of\ncertain parties, such as our employees,\ncustomers, providers of products and\nservices, counterparties and other third\nparties, or damage to their computers or\nsystems. Any future technology failure,\ncyberattack or breach could adversely\naffect our ability to conduct day-to-day\nbusiness activities, effect\ntransactions, service our clients,\nmanage our exposure to risk or expand\nour\n                                                                                  \n  15Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nbusinesses, result in fraudulent or\nunauthorized transactions or cause\nprolonged computer and network outages\nresulting in material disruptions to our\nor our customers\u2019 or other third\nparties\u2019 network access or critical\nbusiness operations and customer\nservices, in the U.S. and/or globally.\n\nAny cyberattack or breach, whether\ndirected at us or third parties, may\nresult in significant lost revenue, give\nrise to losses and claims brought by\nthird parties, litigation exposure,\nregulatory sanctions, enforcement\nactions, government fines, penalties or\nintervention and other negative\nconsequences. The actual or perceived\nsuccess of a cyberattack on our systems\nmay damage our reputation with customers\nand third parties with whom we do\nbusiness and/or result in the loss of\nconfidence in our security measures.\nAdditionally, our failure to disclose or\ncommunicate cyber incidents\nappropriately to relevant parties could\nresult in regulatory, privacy,\noperational and reputational risk.\nAlthough we maintain cyber insurance,\nthere can be no assurance that\nliabilities or losses we may incur will\nbe covered under such policies or that\nthe amount of insurance will be\nadequate. Cyberattacks or other\ninformation or security breaches could\nalso result in a violation of applicable\nprivacy and other laws, reimbursement or\nother compensatory costs, additional\ncompliance costs, and our internal\ncontrols or disclosure controls being\nrendered ineffective. The occurrence of\nany of these events could adversely\nimpact our businesses, results of\noperations, liquidity and financial\ncondition.\n\nFailure to satisfy our obligations as\nservicer for residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, loans owned by other\nentities and other related losses could\nadversely impact our reputation,\nservicing costs or results of\noperations.\n\nWe and our legacy companies service\nmortgage loans on behalf of third-party\nsecuritization vehicles and other\ninvestors. If we commit a material\nbreach of our obligations as servicer or\nmaster servicer, we may be subject to\ntermination if the breach is not cured\nwithin a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which could cause us\nto lose servicing income. We may also\nhave liability for any failure by us, as\na servicer or master servicer, for any\nact or omission on our part that\ninvolves willful misfeasance, bad faith,\ngross negligence or reckless disregard\nof our duties. If any such breach was\nfound to have occurred, it may harm our\nreputation, increase our servicing costs\nor losses due to potential\nindemnification obligations, result in\nlitigation or regulatory action or\nadversely impact our results of\noperations. Additionally, foreclosures\nmay result in costs, litigation or\nlosses due to irregularities in the\nunderlying documentation, or if the\nvalidity of a foreclosure action is\nchallenged by a borrower or overturned\nby a court because of errors or\ndeficiencies in the foreclosure process.\nWe may also incur costs or losses\nrelating to delays or alleged\ndeficiencies in processing documents\nnecessary to comply with state law\ngoverning foreclosure.\n\nChanges in the structure of and\nrelationship among the GSEs could\nadversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely on the GSEs to guarantee or\npurchase mortgage loans that meet their\nconforming loan requirements. During\n2022, we sold approximately $4.1 billion\nof loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac\n(FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are\ncurrently in conservatorship, with the\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\nacting as conservator. In 2019, the\nTreasury Department published a proposal\nto recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and\nremove them from conservatorship and\nreduce their role in the marketplace. In\nJanuary 2021, the Treasury Department\nfurther amended the agreement that\n\ngoverns the conservatorship of FHLMC and\nFNMA and delineated the continued\nobjective to remove the GSEs from\nconservatorship. However, we cannot\npredict the future prospects of the\nGSEs, timing of the recapitalization or\nrelease from conservatorship, or content\nof legislative or rulemaking proposals\nregarding the future status of the GSEs\nin the housing market. If the GSEs take\na reduced role in the marketplace,\nincluding by limiting the mortgage\nproducts they offer, we could be\nrequired to seek alternative funding\nsources, retain additional loans on our\nbalance sheet, secure funding through\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank system, or\nsecuritize the loans through Private\nLabel Securitization, which could\nincrease our cost of funds related to\nthe origination of new mortgage loans,\nincrease credit risk and/or impact our\ncapacity to originate new mortgage\nloans. Uncertainty regarding their\nfuture and the MBS they guarantee\ncontinues to exist for the foreseeable\nfuture. These developments could\nadversely affect our securities\nportfolios, capital levels, liquidity\nand results of operations.\n\nOur risk management framework may not be\neffective in mitigating risk and\nreducing the potential for losses.\n\nOur risk management framework is\ndesigned to minimize risk and loss to\nus. We seek to effectively and\nconsistently identify, measure, monitor,\nreport and control the key types of risk\nto which we are subject, including\nstrategic, credit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and reputational\nrisks. Additionally, risks may span\nacross multiple key risk types,\nincluding climate risk and legal risk.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified\nset of controls and risk mitigation\ntechniques, including modeling and\nforecasting, hedging strategies and\ntechniques that seek to balance our\nability to profit from trading positions\nwith our exposure to potential losses,\nour ability to control and mitigate\nrisks that result in losses is\ninherently limited by our ability to\nidentify and measure all risks,\nincluding emerging and unknown risks,\nanticipate the timing and impact of\nrisks, apply effective hedging\nstrategies, make correct assumptions,\nmanage and aggregate data correctly and\nefficiently, identify changes in markets\nor client behaviors not yet inherent in\nhistorical data and develop risk\nmanagement models and forecasts to\nassess and control risk.\n\nOur ability to manage risk is dependent\non our ability to consistently execute\nall elements of our risk management\nprogram and develop and maintain a\nculture of managing risk well throughout\nthe Corporation and manage risks\nassociated with third parties, including\nproviders of products and/or services,\nenable effective risk management and\nhelp confirm that risks are\nappropriately considered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely manner.\nUncertain economic and geopolitical\nconditions, heightened legislative and\nregulatory scrutiny of and change within\nthe financial services industry, the\npace of technological changes,\naccounting and market developments, the\nfailure of employees, representatives\nand third parties to comply with our\npolicies and Risk Framework and the\noverall complexity of our operations,\namong other developments, have in the\npast and may in the future result in a\nheightened level of risk. For example,\nwe have experienced increased\noperational, reputational and compliance\nrisk as a result of the prior need to\nrapidly deploy and implement multiple\nand varying pandemic relief programs,\nincluding the processing of unemployment\nbenefits for California and certain\nother states, which have resulted in and\nwill continue to result in losses. Our\nfailure to manage evolving risks or\nproperly anticipate, manage, control or\nmitigate risks could result in\nadditional losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to evolving government\nlegislation and regulations and certain\nsettlements, orders and agreements with\ngovernment authorities from time to\ntime.\n\nWe are subject to evolving and\ncomprehensive regulation under federal\nand state laws in the U.S. and the laws\nof the various jurisdictions in which we\noperate, including increasing and\ncomplex regulatory sanctions regimes.\nThese laws and regulations significantly\naffect and have the potential to\nrestrict the scope of our existing\nbusinesses, limit our ability to pursue\ncertain business opportunities,\nincluding the products and services we\noffer, reduce certain fees and rates or\nmake our products and services more\nexpensive for our clients. We are also\nrequired to file various financial and\nnon-financial regulatory reports to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations\nin the jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\n\nWe continue to adjust our business and\noperations, legal entity structure,\ndisclosure and policies, processes,\nprocedures and controls, including with\nregard to capital and liquidity\nmanagement, risk management and data\nmanagement, to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations, as well as guidance and\ninterpretation by regulatory\nauthorities, including the Department of\nTreasury (including the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS)), Federal Reserve, OCC,\nCFPB, Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil, FDIC, Department of Labor, SEC\nand CFTC in the U.S., foreign\nregulators, other government authorities\nand self-regulatory organizations.\nFurther, we could become subject to\nfuture laws, rules and regulations\nbeyond those currently proposed, adopted\nor contemplated in the U.S. or abroad,\nincluding policies and rulemaking\nrelated to emerging technologies,\ncybersecurity and data, and climate risk\nmanagement and ESG governance and\nreporting, including emissions and\nsustainability disclosure. The\ncumulative effect of all of the current\nand possible future legislation and\nregulations on our litigation and\nregulatory exposure, businesses,\noperations and profitability remains\nuncertain and necessitates that we make\ncertain assumptions with respect to the\nscope and requirements of prospective\nand proposed laws, rules and regulations\nin our business planning. If these\nassumptions prove incorrect, we could be\nsubject to increased regulatory, legal\nand compliance risks and costs as well\nas potential reputational harm. Also,\nU.S. and regulatory initiatives abroad\nmay overlap, and non-U.S. regulation and\ninitiatives may be inconsistent or may\nconflict with current or proposed U.S.\nregulations, which could lead to\ncompliance risks and increased costs.\n\nOur regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad\npower and discretion to direct our\nactions, and they have assumed an active\noversight, inspection and investigatory\nrole across the financial services\nindustry. Regulatory focus is not\nlimited to laws, rules and regulations\napplicable to the financial services\nindustry, but includes other significant\nlaws, rules and regulations that apply\nacross industries and jurisdictions,\nincluding those related to anti-money\nlaundering, anti-bribery, anti-\ncorruption and regulatory sanctions.\n\nWe are also subject to laws, rules and\nregulations in the U.S. and abroad,\nincluding the GDPR and CCPA as modified\nby the CPRA, and a number of additional\njurisdictions enacting or considering\nsimilar laws, regarding privacy and the\ndisclosure, collection, use, sharing and\nsafeguarding of personally identifiable\ninformation, including our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, counterparties and\nother third parties, the violation of\nwhich could result in litigation,\nregulatory fines, enforcement actions\nand operational loss. The complexity and\nrisk of\n\ncompliance has been magnified by the\ncollection of employee health and/or\nother information in response to the\npandemic. Additionally, we will likely\nbe subject to new and evolving data\nprivacy laws in the U.S. and abroad,\nwhich could result in additional costs\nof compliance, litigation, regulatory\nfines and enforcement actions. There\nremains complexity and uncertainty,\nincluding potential suspension or\nprohibition, regarding data transfer\nbecause of concerns over compliance with\nlaws, rules and regulations for cross-\nborder flows and transfers of personal\ndata from the European Economic Area\n(EEA) to the U.S. and other\njurisdictions outside of the EEA,\nresulting from judicial and regulatory\nguidance. To the extent that a new\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework leads to\na relaxation of applicable legislation\nand regulations, regardless of transfer\nmechanism, challenges are expected from\nconsumer advocacy groups. Other\njurisdictions, including China, Russia\nand India, have commenced consultation\nefforts or enacted new legislation or\nregulations to establish standards for\npersonal data transfers. If cross-border\npersonal data transfers are suspended or\nrestricted or we are required to\nimplement distinct processes for each\njurisdiction\u2019s standards, this could\nresult in operational disruptions to our\nbusinesses, additional costs, increased\nenforcement activity, new contract\nnegotiations with third parties, and/or\nmodification of such data management.\n\nAs part of their enforcement authority,\nour regulators and other government\nauthorities have the authority to, among\nother things, conduct investigations and\nassess significant civil or criminal\nmonetary fines, penalties or\nrestitution, issue cease and desist\norders, initiate injunctive action,\napply regulatory sanctions or enter into\nconsent orders. The amounts paid by us\nand other financial institutions to\nsettle proceedings or investigations\nhave, in some instances, been\nsubstantial and may increase. In some\ncases, governmental authorities have\nrequired criminal pleas or other\nextraordinary terms as part of such\nresolutions, which could have\nsignificant consequences, including\nreputational harm, loss of customers,\nrestrictions on the ability to access\ncapital markets, and the inability to\noperate certain businesses or offer\ncertain products. Our response to\nregulators and other government\nauthorities may be time-consuming, be\nexpensive and divert management\nattention from our business. The outcome\nof any matter, which may last years, may\nbe difficult to predict or estimate.\n\nAdditionally, the terms of settlements,\norders and agreements that we have\nentered into with government entities\nand regulatory authorities have imposed,\nor could impose, significant operational\nand compliance costs on us with respect\nto enhancements to our procedures and\ncontrols, losses with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated\nagainst our customers, expansion of our\nrisk and control functions within our\nlines of business, investment in\ntechnology and the hiring of significant\nnumbers of additional risk, control and\ncompliance personnel. If we fail to meet\nthe requirements of the regulatory\nsettlements, orders or agreements to\nwhich we are subject, or, more\ngenerally, fail to maintain risk and\ncontrol procedures and processes that\nmeet the heightened standards\nestablished by our regulators and other\ngovernment authorities, we could be\nrequired to enter into further\nsettlements, orders or agreements and\npay additional fines, penalties or\njudgments, or accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on our businesses.\n\nImproper actions, behaviors or practices\nby us, our employees or representatives\nthat are illegal, unethical or contrary\nto our core values could harm us, our\nshareholders or customers or damage the\nintegrity of the financial markets, and\nare subject to regulatory scrutiny\nacross jurisdictions. The complexity of\nthe regulatory and enforcement regimes\nin the\n                                                                                  \n  17Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nU.S., coupled with the global scope of\nour operations and the regulatory\nenvironment worldwide, also means that a\nsingle event or practice or a series of\nrelated events or practices may give\nrise to a significant number of\noverlapping investigations and\nregulatory proceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state agencies in\nthe U.S. or by multiple regulators and\nother governmental entities in different\njurisdictions. Actions by other members\nof the financial services industry\nrelated to business activities in which\nwe participate may result in\ninvestigations by regulators or other\ngovernment authorities.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adopted\nappropriate risk management and\ncompliance programs, compliance risks\nwill continue to exist, particularly as\nwe anticipate and adapt to new and\nevolving laws, rules and regulations. We\nalso rely upon third parties who may\nexpose us to compliance and legal risk.\nFuture legislative or regulatory\nactions, and any required changes to our\nbusiness or operations, or those of\nthird parties upon whom we rely,\nresulting from such developments and\nactions could result in a significant\nloss of revenue, impose additional\ncompliance and other costs or otherwise\nreduce our profitability, limit the\nproducts and services that we offer or\nour ability to pursue certain business\nopportunities, require us to dispose of\ncertain businesses or assets, require us\nto curtail certain businesses, affect\nthe value of assets that we hold,\nrequire us to increase our prices and\ntherefore reduce demand for our\nproducts, or otherwise adversely affect\nour businesses.\n\nWe are subject to risks from potential\nliability arising from lawsuits and\nregulatory and government action.\n\nWe face significant legal risks in our\nbusiness, with a high volume of claims\nagainst us and other financial\ninstitutions. The amount of damages,\npenalties and fines that litigants and\nregulators seek from us and other\nfinancial institutions continues to be\nsignificant. This includes disputes with\nconsumers, customers and other\ncounterparties.\n\nFinancial institutions, including us,\ncontinue to be the subject of claims\nalleging anti-competitive conduct with\nrespect to various products and markets,\nincluding U.S. antitrust class actions\nclaiming joint and several liability for\ntreble damages. As disclosed in Note 12\n\u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, we\nalso face contractual indemnification\nand loan-repurchase claims arising from\nalleged breaches of representations and\nwarranties in the sale of residential\nmortgages by legacy companies, which may\nresult in a requirement that we\nrepurchase the mortgage loans, or make\nwhole or provide other remedies to\ncounterparties.\n\nU.S. regulators and government agencies\nregularly pursue enforcement claims\nagainst financial institutions including\nthe Corporation for alleged violations\nof law and customer harm under the\nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery,\nand Enforcement Act, the federal\nsecurities laws, the False Claims Act,\nfair lending laws and regulations\n(including the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct and the Fair Housing Act), antitrust\nlaws, and consumer protection laws and\nregulations related to products and\nservices such as overdraft and sales\npractices, including prohibitions on\nunfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts\nand practices under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Act and the Federal\nTrade Commission Act. Such claims may\ncarry significant penalties, restitution\nand, in certain cases, treble damages,\nand the ultimate resolution of\nregulatory inquiries, investigations and\nother proceedings to which we are\nsubject from time-to-time is difficult\nto predict.\n\nT here is also an increased focus on\ncompliance with U.S. and global laws,\nrules and regulations related to the\ncollection, use, sharing and\nsafeguarding of personally identifiable\ninformation and corporate data, as well\nas the implementation,\n\nuse and management of emerging\ntechnologies, including AI and machine\nlearning. Additionally, misconduct by\nour employees and representatives,\nincluding unethical, fraudulent,\nimproper or illegal conduct, unfair,\ndeceptive, abusive or discriminatory\nbusiness practices, or violations of\npolicies, procedures, laws, rules or\nregulations, including conduct that\naffects compliance with books and\nrecords requirements, can result in\nlitigation and/or government\ninvestigations and enforcement actions,\nand cause significant reputational harm.\nWe are also subject to litigation and\nregulatory and government actions\nregarding fraud perpetrated against our\ncustomers in connection with the use of\nour products and services and increased\nscrutiny of sustainability-related\npolicies, goals, targets and disclosure,\nwhich could result in litigation,\nregulatory investigations and actions\nand reputational harm.\n\nThe global environment of extensive\ninvestigations, regulation, regulatory\ncompliance burdens, litigation and\nregulatory enforcement, combined with\nuncertainty related to the continually\nevolving regulatory environment, have\naffected and will likely continue to\naffect operational and compliance costs\nand risks, including the limitation or\ncessation of our ability or feasibility\nto continue providing certain products\nand services. Lawsuits and regulatory\nactions have resulted in and will likely\ncontinue to result in judgments, orders,\nsettlements, penalties and fines adverse\nto us. Further, we entered into orders\nwith government authorities regarding\nour participation in implementing\ngovernment relief measures related to\nthe pandemic and other federal and state\ngovernment assistance programs,\nincluding the processing of unemployment\nbenefits for California and certain\nother states, and continue to be\ninvolved in related litigation which may\nresult in judgments and/or settlements.\nLitigation and investigation costs,\nsubstantial legal liability or\nsignificant regulatory or government\naction against us could have material\nadverse effects on our business,\nfinancial condition, including\nliquidity, and results of operations,\nand/or cause significant reputational\nharm.\n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may\nrequire us to increase our regulatory\ncapital, total loss-absorbing capacity\n(TLAC), long-term debt or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. regulatory\ncapital and liquidity rules. These\nrules, among other things, establish\nminimum requirements to qualify as a\nwell-capitalized institution. If any of\nour subsidiary insured depository\ninstitutions fail to maintain their\nstatus as well capitalized under the\napplicable regulatory capital rules, the\nFederal Reserve will require us to agree\nto bring the insured depository\ninstitution back to well-capitalized\nstatus. For the duration of such an\nagreement, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose restrictions on our activities.\nIf we were to fail to enter into or\ncomply with such an agreement, the\nFederal Reserve may impose more severe\nrestrictions on our activities,\nincluding requiring us to cease and\ndesist activities permitted under the\nBank Holding Company Act of 1956.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements are\nfrequently introduced and amended. It is\npossible that regulators may increase\nregulatory capital requirements\nincluding TLAC and long-term debt\nrequirements, change how regulatory\ncapital or RWA is calculated or increase\nliquidity requirements. Our ability to\nreturn capital to our shareholders\ndepends in part on our ability to\nmaintain regulatory capital levels above\nminimum requirements plus buffers. To\nthe extent that increases occur in our\nSCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical\ncapital buffer, our returns of capital\nto shareholders, including common stock\ndividends and common stock repurchases,\ncould decrease. For example, our G-SIB\nsurcharge is expected to increase by 50\nbps to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024.\nThe Federal Reserve could\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18                                                               \n                                                                                  \nalso limit or prohibit capital actions,\nsuch as paying or increasing dividends\nor repurchasing common stock, as a\nresult of economic disruptions or\nevents.\n\nAs part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve\nconducts stress testing on parts of our\nbusiness using hypothetical economic\nscenarios prepared by the Federal\nReserve. Those scenarios may affect our\nCCAR stress test results, which may\nimpact the level of our SCB, requiring\nus to hold additional capital. For\nexample, based on CCAR 2022 stress test\nresults, our SCB increased 90 bps to 3.4\npercent on October 1, 2022.\n\nA significant component of regulatory\ncapital ratios is calculating our RWA\nand our leverage exposure, which may\nincrease. The Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision has also revised several key\nmethodologies for measuring RWA that\nhave not yet been implemented in the\nU.S., including a standardized approach\nfor operational risk, revised market\nrisk requirements and constraints on the\nuse of internal models, as well as a\ncapital floor based on the revised\nstandardized approaches. It is expected\nin 2023 that U.S. banking regulators\nwill propose updates to the U.S. capital\nframework to incorporate the Basel\nCommittee revisions. Economic\ndisruptions or events may also cause an\nincrease in our balance sheet, RWA or\nleverage exposures, increasing required\nregulatory capital and liquidity\namounts.\n\nChanges to and compliance with the\nregulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements may impact our operations\nby requiring us to liquidate assets,\nincrease borrowings, issue additional\nequity or other securities, reduce the\namount of common stock repurchases or\ndividends, cease or alter certain\noperations and business activities or\nhold highly liquid assets, which may\nadversely affect our results of\noperations.\n\nChanges in accounting standards or\nassumptions in applying accounting\npolicies could adversely affect us.\n\nAccounting policies and methods are\nfundamental to how we record and report\nour financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies\nrequire use of estimates and assumptions\nthat may affect the reported value of\nour assets or liabilities and results of\noperations and are critical because they\nrequire management to make difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments about\nmatters that are inherently uncertain.\nIf assumptions, estimates or judgments\nwere erroneously applied, we could be\nrequired to correct and restate prior-\nperiod financial statements. Accounting\nstandard-setters and those who interpret\nthe accounting standards, including the\nSEC, banking regulators and our\nindependent registered public accounting\nfirm may also amend or even reverse\ntheir previous interpretations or\npositions on how various standards\nshould be applied. These changes may be\ndifficult to predict and could impact\nthe preparation and reporting of our\nfinancial statements, including the\napplication of new or revised standards\nretrospectively, resulting in revisions\nto prior-period financial statements.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by changes\nin U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and\nregulations.\n\nIt is possible that governmental\nauthorities in the U.S. and/or other\ncountries could further change tax laws\nin a way that would materially adversely\naffect us, including changes to the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022. New guidelines\nissued by the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development could\nadversely impact how the global profits\nof multinational enterprises are taxed.\nAny change in tax laws and regulations\nor interpretations of current or future\ntax laws and regulations could\nmaterially adversely affect our\neffective tax rate, tax liabilities and\nresults of operations. U.S. and foreign\ntax laws are complex and our judgments,\n\ninterpretations or applications of such\ntax laws could differ from that of the\nrelevant governmental authority. This\ncould result in additional tax\nliabilities and interest, penalties, the\nreduction of certain tax benefits and/or\nthe requirement to make adjustments to\namounts recorded, which could be\nmaterial.\n\nAdditionally, we have U.K. net deferred\ntax assets (DTA) which consist primarily\nof net operating losses that are\nexpected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Adverse developments with respect\nto tax laws or to other material\nfactors, such as prolonged worsening of\nEurope\u2019s capital markets or changes in\nthe ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to\nconduct business in the EU, could lead\nour management to reassess and/or change\nits current conclusion that no valuation\nallowance is necessary with respect to\nour U.K. net DTA.\n                                                                                  \n  Reputation                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nDamage to our reputation could harm our\nbusinesses, including our competitive\nposition and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain\ncustomers, clients, investors and\nemployees is impacted by our reputation.\nHarm to our reputation can arise from\nvarious sources, including actual or\nperceived activities of our officers,\ndirectors, employees, contractors, third\nparties, clients, counterparties and\nother representatives, such as fraud,\nmisconduct and unethical behavior (such\nas employees\u2019 sales practices), adequacy\nof our responsiveness to fraud claims\nperpetrated against our customers,\neffectiveness of our internal controls,\nlitigation or regulatory matters and\ntheir outcomes, compensation practices,\nlending practices, suitability or\nreasonableness of particular trading or\ninvestment strategies, including the\nreliability of our research and models,\nand prohibiting clients from engaging in\ncertain transactions.\n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by\nactual or perceived failure to deliver\nthe products and standards of service\nand quality expected by our customers,\nclients and the community, including the\noverstatement or mislabeling of the\nenvironmental benefits of our products,\nservices or transactions, failure to\nrecognize and address customer\ncomplaints, compliance failures,\ninability to implement or manage\nemerging technologies, including quantum\ncomputing, AI, machine learning and\ntechnology change, failure to maintain\neffective data management, security\nbreaches, cyber incidents, prolonged or\nrepeated system outages, unintended\ndisclosure of personal, proprietary or\nconfidential information, breach of\nfiduciary obligations and handling of\nthe emergence or continuation of health\nemergencies or pandemics. For example,\nwe entered into orders with certain\ngovernment agencies regarding our\nprocessing of unemployment benefits for\nCalifornia and certain other states, and\ncontinue to be involved in related\nlitigation, which may result in\njudgments and/or settlements. Our\nreputation may also be negatively\nimpacted by our ESG practices and\ndisclosures, and those of our customers\nand third parties.\n\nActions by the financial services\nindustry generally or by certain members\nor individuals in the industry also can\nadversely affect our reputation. Also,\nadverse publicity or negative\ninformation posted on social media by\nemployees, the media or otherwise,\nwhether or not factually correct, may\nadversely impact our business prospects\nor financial results.\n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving\nlaws and regulations regarding fair\nlending activity, UDAAP, electronic\nfunds transfers, know-your-customer\nrequirements, data protection and\nprivacy, including the GDPR, CCPA as\nmodified by the CPRA, cross-border data\nmovement, cybersecurity and other\nmatters, as well as evolving and\nexpansive interpretations of these laws\nand\n                                                                                  \n  19Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nregulations. Principles concerning the\nappropriate scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy vary considerably in\ndifferent jurisdictions, and regulatory\nand public expectations regarding the\ndefinition and scope of consumer and\ncommercial privacy may remain fluid.\nThese laws may be interpreted and\napplied by various jurisdictions in a\nmanner inconsistent with our current or\nfuture practices, or with one another.\nIf personal, confidential or proprietary\ninformation of customers in our\npossession, or in the possession of\nthird parties or financial data\naggregators, is mishandled, misused or\nmismanaged, or if we do not timely or\nadequately address such information, we\nmay face regulatory, legal and\noperational risks, which could adversely\naffect our reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\nWe could suffer reputational harm if we\nfail to properly identify and manage\npotential conflicts of interest.\nManagement of potential conflicts of\ninterest has become increasingly complex\nas we expand our business activities\nthrough more numerous transactions,\nobligations and interests with and among\nour clients. The actual or perceived\nfailure to adequately address conflicts\nof interest could affect the willingness\nof clients to use our products and\nservices, or result in litigation or\nenforcement actions, which could\nadversely affect our business.\n\nOur actual or perceived failure to\naddress these and other issues, such as\noperational risks, gives rise to\nreputational risk that could harm us and\nour business prospects. Failure to\nappropriately address any of these\nissues could also give rise to\nadditional regulatory restrictions,\nlegal risks and reputational harm, which\ncould, among other consequences,\nincrease the size and number of\nlitigation claims and damages asserted\nor subject us to enforcement actions,\nfines and penalties, and cause us to\nincur related costs and expenses.\n                                                                                  \n  Other                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe impacts of the pandemic have\nadversely affected and may in the future\nadversely affect us.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has directly and\nindirectly negatively impacted the\nglobal economy, disrupted global supply\nchains, adversely affected equity market\nvaluations, created significant\nvolatility and disruption in financial\nand capital markets, resulted in\nchallenging labor market conditions, and\nadversely impacted our financial results\nto varying degrees and in various\nrespects. The future direct and indirect\neffects of the pandemic on global health\nand economic conditions and activity\nremain uncertain, continue to evolve by\nregion, country and state and depend on\nfuture developments that cannot be\npredicted, including impacts from the\nexpiration of the federal COVID-19\nPublic Health Emergency, surges of\nCOVID-19 cases and the spread of more\ndangerous variants of COVID-19, the\navailability, usage and acceptance of\neffective medical treatments and\nvaccines, changing client preferences\nand behavior and future public response\nand government actions, including travel\nbans and restrictions, and limitations\non business. Such evolving impacts of\nthe pandemic could disrupt the U.S. and\nglobal economy, including changes in\nfinancial and capital markets, and\nadversely affect our businesses and\noperations, liquidity, results of\noperations and financial condition,\nincluding from increased allowance for\ncredit losses and noninterest expenses,\nwhich are dependent on the pandemic\u2019s\nduration and severity.\n\nReforms to and replacement of IBORs and\ncertain other rates or indices may\nadversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nThough significant progress has been\nmade in the global financial markets to\nreplace products and contracts\nreferencing London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) or other IBORs (IBOR\nProducts), the aggregate notional amount\nof these IBOR\n\nProducts remains material to our\nbusiness. Risks and challenges\nassociated with the transition from\nIBORs remain and may result in\nconsequences that cannot be fully\nanticipated, which expose us to various\nfinancial, operational, supervisory,\nconduct and legal risk.\n\nWhile there has been significant\nprogress in market and client adoption\nof ARRs, usage of ARRs may vary across\nor within categories of contracts,\nproducts and services, potentially\nresulting in market fragmentation,\ndecreased trading volumes and liquidity,\nincreased complexity and modeling and\noperational risks. ARRs have\ncompositions and characteristics that\ndiffer from the benchmarks they replace,\nin some cases they have limited\nliquidity, and may demonstrate less\npredictable performance over time than\nthe benchmarks they replace. For\nexample, certain ARRs are calculated on\na compounded or weighted-average basis\nand, unlike IBORs, do not reflect bank\ncredit risk and therefore typically\nrequire a spread adjustment. There are\nimportant differences between the\nfallbacks, triggers and calculation\nmethodologies being implemented in cash\nand derivatives markets. Any mismatch\nbetween the adoption of ARRs in loans,\nsecurities and derivatives markets may\nimpact hedging or other financial\narrangements we have implemented, and we\nmay experience unanticipated market\nexposures. Changes resulting from\ntransition to successor or alternative\nrates may adversely affect the yield on\nloans or securities held by us, amounts\npaid on securities we have issued,\namounts received and paid on derivatives\nwe have entered into, the value of such\nloans, securities or derivative\ninstruments, the trading market for such\nproducts and contracts, and our ability\nto effectively use hedging instruments\nto manage risk. There can be no\nassurance that existing assets and\nliabilities based on or linked to IBORs\nthat have not already transitioned to\nARRs will transition without delay or\npotential disputes.\n\nAlthough a significant majority of the\naggregate notional amount of our\nremaining IBOR Products maturing after\n2022 include or have been amended to\ninclude fallbacks to ARRs, the\ntransitioning of certain IBOR Products\nthat do not include fallback provisions\nor adequate fallback mechanisms require\nadditional efforts to modify their\nterms. Some outstanding IBOR Products\nare particularly challenging to modify\ndue to the requirement that all impacted\nparties consent to such modification. To\naddress outstanding IBOR Products that\nare difficult to modify, legislation has\nbeen adopted in the U.S. and in other\njurisdictions. Litigation, disputes or\nother action may occur as a result of\nthe interpretation or application of\nlegislation or regulations, including if\nthere is an overlap between laws or\nregulations in different jurisdictions\nor from interactions with any FCA-\ncompelled \u201csynthetic\u201d LIBOR settings.\n\nSome of our IBOR Products may contain\nlanguage giving the calculation agent\n(which may be us) discretion to\ndetermine the successor rate (including\nthe applicable spread adjustment) to the\nexisting benchmark. We may face a risk\nof litigation, disputes or other actions\nfrom clients, counterparties, customers,\ninvestors or others based on various\nclaims, for example, that we incorrectly\ninterpreted or enforced IBOR-based\ncontract provisions, failed to\nappropriately communicate the effect\nthat the transition to ARRs will have on\nexisting and future products, treated\naffected parties unfairly or made\ninappropriate product recommendations to\nor investments on behalf of its clients,\nor engaged in anti-competitive behavior\nor unlawfully manipulated markets or\nbenchmarks.\n\nARR-based products that we develop,\nlaunch and/or support, including\nproducts using credit sensitive rates,\nmay perform differently to IBOR Products\nduring times of economic stress,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America20                                                               \n                                                                                  \nadverse or volatile market conditions\nand across the credit and economic\ncycle, which may impact the value,\nreturn on and profitability of our ARR-\nbased assets. New financial products\nlinked to ARRs may have additional\nlegal, financial, tax, operational,\nmarket, compliance, reputational,\ncompetitive or other risks to us, our\nclients and other market participants.\nBanking regulators in the U.S. and\nglobally have maintained heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and intensified\nsupervisory focus on financial\ninstitution LIBOR transition plans,\npreparations and readiness, including\nour use of credit-sensitive rates like\nthe Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield\nIndex and ARR-based term rates, which\ncould result in regulatory action,\nlitigation and/or the need to change the\nproducts offered by our businesses.\nFailure to meet industry-wide IBOR\ntransition milestones and to cease\nissuance of IBOR Products by relevant\ncessation dates may, subject to certain\nregulatory exceptions, result in\nsupervisory enforcement by applicable\nregulators, increase our cost of, and\naccess to, capital or lead to other\nconsequences.\n\nThe ongoing market transition has\naltered, and additional developments may\nfurther alter, some aspects of our risk\nprofile and risk management strategies,\nincluding derivatives and hedging\nstrategies, modeling and analytics,\nvaluation tools, product design and\nsystems, controls, procedures and\noperational infrastructure. Further\nchanges may increase costs and expose us\nto potential risks related to regulatory\ncompliance, requirements or inquiries.\nAmong other risks, various IBOR Products\ntransition to ARRs at different times or\nin different manners, with the result\nthat we may face unexpected interest\nrate, pricing or other exposures across\nbusiness or product lines, and we may\nface operational risks related to\nplanned processes at certain CCPs to\nconvert outstanding USD LIBOR-cleared\nderivatives to ARR positions. Continuing\nreforms to market transition and other\nfactors may adversely affect our\nbusiness, including the ability to serve\ncustomers and maintain market share,\nfinancial condition or results of\noperations and could result in\nreputational harm to us.\n\nWe face significant and increasing\ncompetition in the financial services\nindustry.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and experience intense\ncompetition from local and global\nfinancial institutions and new entrants\nin domestic and foreign markets. We\ncompete on the basis of a number of\nfactors, including customer service and\nconvenience, the pricing, quality and\nrange of products and services we offer,\nlending limits, the quality and delivery\nof our technology and our reputation,\nexperience and relationships in relevant\nmarkets. There is increasing pressure to\nprovide products and services on more\nattractive terms, including lower fees\nand higher interest rates on deposits,\nand lower cost investment strategies,\nwhich may impact our ability to\neffectively compete. The changing\nregulatory environment may also create\ncompetitive disadvantages, including\nfrom different regulatory requirements.\n\nEmerging technologies and the growth of\ne-commerce have lowered geographic and\nmonetary barriers of other financial\ninstitutions, made it easier for non-\ndepository institutions to offer\ntraditional banking products and\nservices and allowed non-traditional\nfinancial service providers and\ntechnology companies to compete with\ntraditional financial service companies\nin providing electronic and internet-\nbased financial solutions and services,\nincluding electronic securities trading\nwith low or no fees and commissions,\nmarketplace lending, financial data\naggregation and payment processing\nservices, including real-time payment\nplatforms. Further, clients may choose\nto conduct business with other market\nparticipants who engage in business or\noffer products in areas we deem\nspeculative or risky as an\n\nalternative to traditional banking\nproducts. Increased competition may\nreduce our net interest margin and\nrevenues from our fee-based products and\nservices and negatively affect our\nearnings, including by pressuring us to\nlower pricing or credit standards,\nrequiring additional investment to\nimprove the quality and delivery of our\ntechnology, reducing our market share\nand/or affecting the willingness of our\nclients to do business with us.\n\nOur inability to adapt our business\nstrategies, products and services could\nharm our business.\n\nWe rely on a diversified mix of\nbusinesses that deliver a broad range of\nfinancial products and services through\nmultiple distribution channels. Our\nsuccess depends on our and our third-\nparty providers\u2019 of products and\nservices abilities to adapt our business\nstrategies, products and services and\ntheir respective features in a timely\nmanner, including available payment\nprocessing services and technology to\nrapidly evolving industry standards and\nconsumer preferences.\n\nThe widespread adoption and rapid\nevolution of emerging technologies,\nincluding analytic capabilities, self-\nservice digital trading platforms and\nautomated trading markets, internet\nservices, and digital assets, such as\ncentral bank digital currencies,\ncryptocurrencies (including\nstablecoins), tokens and other\ncryptoassets that utilize distributed\nledger technology (DLT), as well as DLT\nin payment, clearing and settlement\nprocesses creates additional risks,\ncould negatively impact our ability to\ncompete and require substantial\nexpenditures to the extent we were to\nmodify or adapt our existing products\nand services. As such new technologies\nevolve and mature, our businesses and\nresults of operations could be adversely\nimpacted, including as a result of the\nintroduction of new competitors to the\npayment ecosystem and increased\nvolatility in deposits and/or\nsignificant long-term reduction in\ndeposits (i.e., financial\ndisintermediation). Also, we may not be\nas timely or successful in developing or\nintroducing new products and services,\nintegrating new products or services\ninto our existing offerings, responding,\nmanaging or adapting to changes in\nconsumer behavior, preferences,\nspending, investing and/or saving\nhabits, achieving market acceptance of\nour products and services, reducing\ncosts in response to pressures to\ndeliver products and services at lower\nprices or sufficiently developing and\nmaintaining loyal customers. The\nCorporation\u2019s, or its third-party\nproviders\u2019, inability or resistance to\ntimely innovate or adapt its operations,\nproducts and services to evolving\nindustry standards and consumer\npreferences could result in service\ndisruptions and harm our business and\nadversely affect our results of\noperations and reputation.\n\nWe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial harm if our\nmodels fail to properly anticipate and\nmanage risk.\n\nWe use models extensively to forecast\nlosses, project revenue and expenses,\nassess and control our operations and\nfinancial condition, assist in capital\nplanning and measure, forecast and\nassess capital and liquidity\nrequirements for credit, market,\noperational and strategic risks. Under\nour Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model\nRisk Management is required to perform\nmodel oversight, including independent\nvalidation before initial use, ongoing\nmonitoring reviews through outcomes\nanalysis and benchmarking, and periodic\nrevalidation. However, models are\nsubject to inherent limitations from\nsimplifying assumptions, uncertainty\nregarding economic and financial\noutcomes, and emerging risks from\napplications that rely on AI.\n\nOur models may not be sufficiently\npredictive of future results due to\nlimited historical patterns, extreme or\nunanticipated market movements or\ncustomer behavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe market\ndownturns or stress events (e.g.,\ngeopolitical or pandemic events), which\ncould limit\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ntheir effectiveness and require timely\nrecalibration. The models that we use to\nassess and control our market risk\nexposures also reflect assumptions about\nthe degree of correlation among prices\nof various asset classes or other market\nindicators, which may not be\nrepresentative of the next downturn and\nwould magnify the limitations inherent\nin using historical data to manage risk.\nMarket conditions in recent years have\ninvolved unprecedented dislocations and\nhighlight the limitations inherent in\nusing historical data to manage risk.\nOur models may also be adversely\nimpacted by human error and may not be\neffective if we fail to properly oversee\nand review them at regular intervals and\ndetect their flaws during our review and\nmonitoring processes, they contain\nerroneous data, assumptions, valuations,\nformulas or algorithms or our\napplications running the models do not\nperform as expected. Regardless of the\nsteps we take to help confirm effective\ncontrols, governance, monitoring and\ntesting, and implement new technology\nand automated processes, we could suffer\noperational, reputational and financial\nharm, including funding or liquidity\nshortfalls, if models fail to properly\nanticipate and manage risks.\n\nFailure to properly manage data may\nresult in our inability to manage risk\nand business needs, errors in our\noperations, critical reporting and\nstrategic decision-making, inaccurate\nreporting and non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations.\n\nWe rely on our ability to manage and\nprocess data in an accurate, timely and\ncomplete manner, including capturing,\ntransporting, aggregating, using,\ntransmitting data externally, and\nretaining and protecting data\nappropriately. While we continually\nupdate our policies, programs, processes\nand practices and implement emerging\ntechnologies, such as automation, AI and\nrobotics, our data management processes\nmay not be effective and are subject to\nweaknesses and failures, including human\nerror, data limitations, process delays,\nsystem failure or failed controls.\nFailure to properly manage data\neffectively in an accurate, timely and\ncomplete manner may adversely impact its\nquality and reliability and our ability\nto manage current and emerging risk,\nproduce accurate financial and non-\nfinancial, regulatory and operational\nreporting, detect or surveil potential\nmisconduct or non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations, as well as to\nmanage changing business needs,\nstrategic decision-making, resolution\nstrategy and operations. The failure to\nestablish and maintain effective,\nefficient and controlled data management\ncould adversely impact our ability to\ndevelop our products and relationships\nwith our customers, increase regulatory\nrisk and operational losses, and damage\nour reputation.\n\nOur operations, businesses and customers\ncould be adversely affected by the\nimpacts related to climate change.\n\nClimate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters present short-\nterm and long-term risks to us. The\nphysical risks include an increase in\nthe frequency and severity of extreme\nweather events and natural disasters,\nincluding floods, wildfires, hurricanes\nand tornados, as well as chronic longer-\nterm shifts such as rising average\nglobal temperatures and sea levels. Such\ndisasters could impact our facilities\nand employees and disrupt our operations\nor the operations of customers or third\nparties, and result in market volatility\nor negatively impact our customers\u2019\nability to repay outstanding loans,\nresult in rapid deposit outflows or\ndrawdowns of credit facilities, cause\nsupply chain and/or distribution network\ndisruptions, damage collateral or result\nin the deterioration of the value of\ncollateral or insurance shortfalls.\n\nThere is also increasing risk related to\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\nChanges in consumer preferences, market\npressures, advancements in technology\nand additional\n\nlegislation, regulatory and legal\nrequirements could alter the scope of\nour existing businesses, limit our\nability to pursue certain business\nactivities and offer certain products\nand services, amplify credit and market\nrisks, negatively impact asset values\nand increase expenses, including as a\nresult of legal, compliance and public\ndisclosure costs in the U.S. and\nglobally with potential jurisdictional\ndivergence, strategic planning, required\ncapital expenditures and changes in\ntechnology and markets, including supply\nchain and insurance availability and\ncost. We have devoted and expect to\ncontinue to devote additional resources\nas a result of our response to climate\nchange. Our climate change strategies,\npolicies, and disclosures, our ability\nto achieve our climate-related goals,\ntargets and commitments, and/or the\nenvironmental or climate impacts\nattributable to our products,\ntransactions or services will likely\nresult in heightened legal and\ncompliance risk and could result in\nreputational harm as a result of\nnegative public sentiment, regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation and reduced\ninvestor and stakeholder confidence. Our\nability to meet our climate-related\ngoals, targets and commitments,\nincluding our goal to achieve certain\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets\nby 2030 and net zero GHG emissions in\nour financing activities, operations and\nsupply chain before 2050, is subject to\nrisks and uncertainties, many of which\nare outside of our control, such as\ntechnology advances, clearly defined\nroadmaps for industry sectors, public\npolicies and better emissions data\nreporting, and ongoing engagement with\ncustomers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.\n\nThere are and will continue to be\nchallenges related to capturing,\nverifying, analyzing and disclosing\nclimate-related data, which includes\nnonfinancial data and other information\nthat is subject to measurement\nuncertainties, may not be independently\nverified, and may result in legal or\nreputational harm.\n\nOur ability to attract, develop and\nretain qualified employees is critical\nto our success, business prospects and\ncompetitive position.\n\nOur performance and competitive position\nis heavily dependent on the talents,\ndevelopment and efforts of highly\nskilled individuals. Competition for\nqualified personnel within the financial\nservices industry and from businesses\noutside the financial services industry\nis intense.\n\nOur competitors include global\ninstitutions and institutions subject to\ndifferent compensation and hiring\nregulations than those imposed on U.S.\ninstitutions and financial institutions.\nAlso, our ability to attract, develop\nand retain employees could be impacted\nby changing workforce concerns,\nexpectations, practices and preferences\n(including remote work), and increasing\nlabor shortages and competition for\nlabor, which could increase labor costs.\n\nIn order to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel, we must provide market-level\ncompensation.

At December\n31, 2022 and 2021, our direct net\ncountry exposure to Russia was $443\nmillion and $733 million, primarily\nconsisting of outstanding loans and\nleases totaling $391 million and $686\nmillion, and our net country exposure to\nUkraine was not significant. While the\nCorporation\u2019s direct exposure to Russia\nis limited, the potential duration,\ncourse and impact of the Russia/Ukraine\nconflict remain uncertain and could\nadversely affect macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical conditions, which could\nnegatively impact the Corporation's\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial position.

The remaining USD\nLIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one\nmonth, three month, six month and 12\nmonth) will cease or become non-\nrepresentative immediately after June\n30, 2023, although the Financial Conduct\nAuthority (FCA) has issued a\nconsultation seeking views on whether to\ncompel publication of the one-month,\nthree-month and six-month USD LIBOR\nsettings on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis for a\nshort time after June 30, 2023 (i.e.,\nthrough September 30, 2024). Separately,\nthe Federal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) issued supervisory guidance\nencouraging banks to cease entering into\nnew contracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate by December 31, 2021,\nsubject to certain regulatory-approved\nexceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\n\nAs a result, a major transition has been\nand continues to be in progress in the\nglobal financial markets with respect to\nthe replacement of Interbank Offered\nRates (IBORs). This has been and\ncontinues to be a complex process\nimpacting a variety of our businesses\nand operations. IBORs have historically\nbeen used in many of the Corporation\u2019s\nproducts and contracts, including\nderivatives, consumer and commercial\nloans, mortgages, floating-rate notes\nand other adjustable-rate products and\nfinancial instruments. In response, the\nCorporation established an enterprise-\nwide IBOR transition program, with\nactive involvement of senior management\nand regular reports to the Management\nRisk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk\nCommittee (ERC). The program continues\nto drive the Corporation's industry and\nregulatory engagement, client and\nfinancial contract changes, internal and\nexternal communications, technology and\noperations modifications, including\nupdates to its operational models,\nsystems and processes, introduction of\nnew products, migration of existing\nclients, and program strategy and\ngovernance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation\ntransitioned or otherwise addressed\nIBOR-based products and contracts\nreferencing the rates that ceased or\nbecame non-representative after December\n31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked\ncommercial loans, LIBOR-based\nadjustable-rate consumer mortgages,\nLIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer\ntrading of certain USD LIBOR and other\ninterest rate swaps, and related hedging\narrangements. Additionally, in\naccordance with the USD LIBOR Guidance,\nthe Corporation has ceased entering into\nnew contracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate, subject to limited\nexceptions, including those consistent\nwith supervisory guidance.\n\nThe Corporation launched capabilities\nand services to support the issuance of\nand trading in products indexed to\nvarious alternative reference rates\n(ARRs) and developed employee training\nprograms as well as other internal and\nexternal sources of information on the\nvarious challenges and opportunities\nthat the replacement of IBORs has\npresented and continues to present. The\nCorporation continues to monitor a\nvariety of market scenarios as part of\nits transition efforts, including risks\nassociated with insufficient preparation\nby\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nindividual market participants or the\noverall market ecosystem, ability of\nmarket participants to meet regulatory\nand industry-wide recommended\nmilestones, and access and demand by\nclients and market participants to\nliquidity in certain products, including\nLIBOR products. With respect to the\ntransition of LIBOR products referencing\nUSD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming\nnon-representative as of June 30, 2023,\na significant majority of the\nCorporation\u2019s notional contractual\nexposure to such LIBOR settings, of\nwhich the significant majority is\nderivatives contracts, have been\nremediated (i.e., updated to include\nfallback provisions to ARRs based on\nmarket-driven protocols, regulatory\nguidance and industry-recommended\nfallback provisions and related\nmechanisms), and the Corporation is\ncontinuing to remediate the remaining\nUSD LIBOR exposure. For example, during\nthe first half of 2023, certain central\ncounterparties (CCPs) expect to complete\nprocesses to convert outstanding USD\nLIBOR-cleared derivatives to ARR\npositions. The remaining exposure, a\nmajority of which is made up of\nderivatives and commercial loans and\nwhich represents a small minority of\noutstanding USD LIBOR notional\ncontractual exposure of the Corporation,\nrequires active dialogue with clients to\nmodify the contracts. For any residual\nexposures after June 2023 that continue\nto have no fallback provisions, the\nCorporation continues to assess and\nplans to leverage relevant contractual\nand statutory solutions, including the\nAdjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in\nthe U.S. (as implemented by the Federal\nReserve) and \u201csynthetic\u201d USD LIBOR (if\nthe FCA compels such publication), to\ntransition such exposure. While there\nremain risks to the Corporation\nassociated with the transition from\nIBORs (as discussed under Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Other on page 20), such risks\nhave been monitored and, where\napplicable, managed through the\nCorporation\u2019s efforts and dedicated\noperational resources to date. In the\nCorporation\u2019s view, the potential\nlikelihood and/or impact of transition-\nrelated risks has lessened over time,\nand the Corporation anticipates it has\ndevoted appropriate resources to\nremaining transition efforts and will be\nable to continue to appropriately\nmonitor and manage such risks as the\ntransition process continues. The\nCorporation expects transition-related\nrisks to further diminish as certain\nmarket developments occur prior to June\n30, 2023. The Corporation has\nimplemented regulatory, tax and\naccounting changes and continues to\nmonitor current and potential impacts of\nthe transition, including Internal\nRevenue Service tax regulations and\nguidance and Financial Accounting\nStandards Board guidance. In addition,\nthe Corporation has engaged impacted\nclients in connection with the\ntransition by providing education on\nARRs and the timing of transition\nevents. The Corporation is also working\nactively with global regulators,\nindustry working groups and trade\nassociations.

Net Interest\nIncome Net interest income increased\n$9.5 billion to $52.5 billion in 2022\ncompared to 2021. Net interest yield on\na fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis\nincreased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96\npercent for 2022.

Provision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $7.1 billion to $2.5 billion\nfor 2022 compared to 2021. The provision\nfor credit losses for 2022 was primarily\ndriven by loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset\nby a reserve release for reduced\nCOVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic)\nuncertainties. For the same period in\nthe prior year, the benefit in the\nprovision for credit losses was due to\nan improved macroeconomic outlook.

Also\nincluded in the effective tax rate for\n2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax\nlaw change further discussed in this\nsection. For more information on our\nrecurring tax preference benefits, see\nNote 19 \u2013 Income Taxes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nAbsent environmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) tax credits and\ndiscrete tax benefits, the effective tax\nrates would have been approximately 25\npercent. On August 16, 2022, the U.S.\nenacted the Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022, which contained a number of tax-\nrelated provisions, including the\nextension and expansion of renewable\nenergy tax credit programs. In\nparticular, partnerships are no longer\nsolely limited to an Investment Tax\nCredit, but can now also elect a\nProduction Tax Credit for solar energy\nproduction facilities placed in service\nafter December 31, 2021. Other notable\ntax law changes include the\nestablishment of a new 15 percent AMT on\nadjusted financial statement income for\nlarge corporations and a one percent\nexcise tax on net stock repurchases,\nboth of which were effective for tax\nyears beginning on or after January 1,\n2023. The tax law changes for the new\nAMT permit business credits, including\nthose from ESG investments in renewable\nenergy and affordable housing, to offset\npotential AMT liability. The Corporation\nhas assessed the potential impacts of\nthese two U.S. tax law changes and does\nnot expect the changes to have a\nsignificant effect on its future\neffective tax rate. On June 10, 2021,\nthe U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act,\nwhich increased the U.K. corporation\nincome tax rate to 25 percent from 19\npercent. This change is effective April\n1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income\ntax expense on future U.K. earnings. As\na result, during the three months ended\nJune 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded\na positive income tax adjustment of\napproximately $2.0 billion with a\ncorresponding write-up of U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets, which reflected a\nreversal of previously recorded write-\ndowns of net deferred tax assets for\nprior changes in the U.K. corporation\nincome tax rate.\n

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and return\non average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity\nas key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 85.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

Net\nincome for Consumer Lending decreased\n$1.8 billion to $5.4 billion primarily\ndue to an increase in provision for\ncredit losses.

Merrill Wealth Management\nprovides tailored solutions to meet\nclients\u2019 needs through a full set of\ninvestment management, brokerage,\nbanking and retirement products.\n\nBank of America Private Bank, together\nwith Merrill Wealth Management\u2019s Private\nWealth Management business, provides\ncomprehensive wealth management\nsolutions targeted to high net worth and\nultra high net worth clients, as well as\ncustomized solutions to meet clients\u2019\nwealth structuring, investment\nmanagement, trust and banking needs,\nincluding specialty asset management\nservices.\n\nNet income for GWIM increased $348\nmillion to $4.7 billion driven by higher\nrevenue, partially offset by higher\nprovision for credit losses and\nnoninterest expense. The operating\nmargin remained unchanged at 28 percent\ncompared to a year ago.\n\nNet interest income increased $1.8\nbillion to $7.5 billion due to the\nimpacts of higher interest rates, as\nwell as the benefits of higher loan and\ndeposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily\nincludes investment and brokerage\nservices income, decreased $802 million\nto $14.3 billion primarily due to the\nimpacts of lower market valuations and\ndeclines in AUM pricing, partially\noffset by the impact of positive AUM\nflows.\n\nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $307 million primarily due to\na dampened macroeconomic outlook and\nloan growth in the current-year period,\ncompared to a benefit in the prior-year\nperiod due to an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. Noninterest expense increased\n$232 million to $15.5 billion primarily\ndue to continued investments in the\nbusiness, partially offset by lower\nrevenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 27 percent, up from 26 percent, due\nto higher net income, partially offset\nby an increase in allocated capital. For\nmore information on capital allocated to\nthe business segments, see Business\nSegment Operations on page 37.\n\nAverage loans increased $22.9 billion to\n$219.8 billion primarily due to\nresidential mortgage, securities-based\nlending and custom lending. Average\ndeposits increased $11.2 billion to\n$351.3 billion primarily driven by\ninflows from new and existing accounts.\n\nMerrill Wealth Management revenue of\n$18.1 billion increased four percent\nprimarily driven by the benefits of\nhigher interest rates, as well as higher\ndeposit and loan balances, partially\noffset by the impact of lower market\nvaluations and declines in AUM pricing.\n\nBank of America Private Bank revenue of\n$3.6 billion increased nine percent\nprimarily driven by the benefits of\nhigher interest rates, as well as higher\ndeposit and loan balances, partially\noffset by the impact of lower market\nvaluations.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America40                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                            \n  Key Indicators and Metrics                                                \n  (Dollars in millions)                                                     \n  Revenue by Business                                 2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Merrill Wealth Management                   $     18,135    $     17,448  \n  Bank of America Private Bank                       3,613           3,300  \n  Total revenue, net of interest expense      $     21,748    $     20,748  \n  Client Balances by Business, at year end                                  \n  Merrill Wealth Management                   $  2,822,910    $  3,214,881  \n  Bank of America Private Bank                     563,931         625,453  \n  Total client balances                       $  3,386,841    $  3,840,334  \n  Client Balances by Type, at year end                                      \n  Assets under management                     $  1,401,474    $  1,638,782  \n  Brokerage and other assets                     1,482,025       1,655,021  \n  Deposits                                         323,899         390,143  \n  Loans and leases(1)                              226,973         212,251  \n  Less: Managed deposits in assets under           -47,530         -55,863  \n  management                                                                \n  Total client balances                       $  3,386,841    $  3,840,334  \n  Assets Under Management Rollforward                                       \n  Assets under management, beginning of       $  1,638,782    $  1,408,465  \n  year                                                                      \n  Net client flows                                  20,785          66,250  \n  Market valuation/other                          -258,093         164,067  \n  Total assets under management, end of       $  1,401,474    $  1,638,782  \n  year                                                                      \n  Total wealth advisors, at year end(2)             19,273          18,846  \n                                                                            \n(1) Includes margin receivables which\nare classified in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Includes advisors across all wealth\nmanagement businesses in GWIM and\nConsumer Banking.\n\nClient Balances\n\nClient balances managed under advisory\nand/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and\nare typically held in diversified\nportfolios.

The decrease in\nclient balances was primarily due to the\nimpact of lower market valuations,\npartially offset by positive client\nflows.\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nGlobal Banking\n                                                                                  \n  (Dollars in millions)                  2022             2021       % Change     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Net interest income              $   12,184       $    8,511             43  %  \n  Noninterest income:                                                             \n  Service charges                       3,293            3,523             -7     \n  Investment banking fees               3,004            5,107            -41     \n  All other income                      3,748            3,734                 \u2014  \n  Total noninterest income             10,045           12,364            -19     \n  Total revenue, net of                22,229           20,875              6     \n  interest expense                                                                \n  Provision for credit losses             641           -3,201           -120     \n  Noninterest expense                  10,966           10,632              3     \n  Income before income taxes           10,622           13,444            -21     \n  Income tax expense                    2,815            3,630            -22     \n  Net income                       $    7,807       $    9,814            -20     \n  Effective tax rate                     26.5  %          27.0  %                 \n  Net interest yield                     2.26             1.55                    \n  Return on average allocated              18               23                    \n  capital                                                                         \n  Efficiency ratio                      49.34            50.93                    \n  Balance Sheet                                                                   \n  Average                                                                         \n  Total loans and leases           $  375,271       $  329,655             14  %  \n  Total earning assets                539,032          549,749             -2     \n  Total assets                        603,273          611,304             -1     \n  Total deposits                      511,804          522,790             -2     \n  Allocated capital                    44,500           42,500              5     \n  Year end                                                                        \n  Total loans and leases           $  379,107       $  352,933              7  %  \n  Total earning assets                522,539          574,583             -9     \n  Total assets                        588,466          638,131             -8     \n  Total deposits                      498,661          551,752            -10     \n                                                                                  \nGlobal Banking , which includes Global\nCorporate Banking, Global Commercial\nBanking, Business Banking and Global\nInvestment Banking, provides a wide\nrange of lending-related products and\nservices, integrated working capital\nmanagement and treasury solutions, and\nunderwriting and advisory services\nthrough our network of offices and\nclient relationship teams.

These increases\nwere driven by higher revenue in both\nFICC and Equities.\n\nNoninterest expense decreased $612\nmillion to $12.4 billion primarily\ndriven by the realignment of a\nliquidating business activity from\nGlobal Markets to All Other in the\nfourth quarter of 2021 and an\nacceleration of expenses from incentive\ncompensation award changes in the prior\nyear .\n\nAverage total assets increased $71.6\nbillion to $857.6 billion driven by loan\ngrowth and commodities activity in FICC.\nPeriod-end total assets increased $64.7\nbillion to $812.5 billion\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America44                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndriven by loan growth, an increase in commodities activity, and higher derivative\nbalances due to higher interest rates. The return on average allocated capital was\n10 percent, down from 12 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in\nallocated capital.

Sales and Trading Revenue\nSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on\ntrading and other assets which are included in market making and similar\nactivities, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity\nsecurities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government\ndebt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations,\ncommercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan\nobligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest\nrate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards,\nswaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity\nactivity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading\nrevenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in\nGlobal Banking .

We take a comprehensive\napproach to risk management with a\ndefined Risk Framework and an\narticulated Risk Appetite Statement,\nwhich are approved annually by the ERC\nand the Board.\n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the\nCorporation are strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational.\n\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current\nor projected financial condition arising\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate.\n\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss\narising from the inability or failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its\nobligations.\n\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes\nin market conditions adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nMarket risk is composed of price risk\nand interest rate risk.\n\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to\nmeet expected or unexpected cash flow\nand collateral needs while continuing to\nsupport our businesses and customers\nunder a range of economic conditions.\n\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal\nor regulatory sanctions, material\nfinancial loss or damage to the\nreputation of the Corporation arising\nfrom the failure of the Corporation to\ncomply with the requirements of\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nand our internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems, people or\nexternal events.\n\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations.\n\nThe following sections address in more\ndetail the specific procedures, measures\nand analyses of the major categories of\nrisk. This discussion of managing risk\nfocuses on the current Risk Framework\nthat, as part of its annual review\nprocess, was approved by the ERC and the\nBoard.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a\nculture of managing risk well is\nfundamental to our values and our\npurpose, and how we drive Responsible\nGrowth. It requires us to focus on risk\nin all activities and encourages the\nnecessary mindset and behavior to enable\neffective risk management and promote\nsound risk-taking within our risk\nappetite. Sustaining a culture of\nmanaging risk well throughout the\norganization is critical to the success\nof the Corporation and is a clear\nexpectation of our executive management\nteam and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with\nBoard oversight, the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business. Management\nreviews and approves the strategic and\nfinancial operating plans, as well as\nthe capital plan and Risk Appetite\nStatement, and recommends them annually\nto the Board for approval. Our strategic\nplan takes into consideration return\nobjectives and financial resources,\nwhich must align with risk capacity and\nrisk appetite. Management sets financial\nobjectives for each business by\nallocating capital and setting a target\nfor return on capital for each business.\nCapital allocations and operating limits\nare regularly evaluated as part of our\noverall governance processes as the\nbusinesses and the economic environment\nin which we operate continue to evolve.\nFor more information regarding capital\nallocations, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 37.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite\nindicates the amount of capital,\nearnings or liquidity we are willing to\nput at risk to achieve our strategic\nobjectives and business plans,\nconsistent with applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Our risk appetite provides\na common framework that includes a set\nof measures to assist senior management\nand the Board in assessing the\nCorporation\u2019s risk profile against our\nrisk appetite and risk capacity. Our\nrisk appetite is formally articulated in\nthe Risk Appetite Statement, which\nincludes both qualitative statements and\nquantitative limits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is\nlimited; therefore, we prioritize the\nrisks we take in order to maintain a\nstrong and flexible financial position\nso we can withstand challenging economic\nconditions and take advantage of organic\ngrowth opportunities. Therefore, we set\nobjectives and targets for capital and\nliquidity that are intended to permit us\nto continue to operate in a safe and\nsound manner at all times, including\nduring periods of stress.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk\nlimits that align with the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk appetite. Senior management is\nresponsible for tracking and reporting\nperformance measurements as well as any\nexceptions to risk appetite limits. The\nBoard, and its committees when\nappropriate, oversee financial\nperformance, execution of the strategic\nand financial operating plans, adherence\nto risk appetite limits and the adequacy\nof internal controls.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our\nrisk management activities, see the\ndiscussion below and pages 49 through\n82.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Governance                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework describes delegations\nof authority whereby the Board and its\ncommittees may delegate authority to\nmanagement-level committees or executive\nofficers. Such delegations may authorize\ncertain decision-making and approval\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in\ndocuments such as committee charters,\njob descriptions, meeting minutes and\nresolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the\ninterrelationship among the Board, Board\ncommittees and management committees\nthat have the majority of risk oversight\nresponsibilities for the Corporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Board of Directors and Board Committees                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Board is composed of 15 directors,\nall but one of whom are independent. The\nBoard authorizes management to maintain\nan effective Risk Framework and oversees\ncompliance with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, the Board or its\ncommittees conduct inquiries of, and\nreceive reports from senior management\non, risk-related matters to assess scope\nor resource limitations that could\nimpede the ability of Global Risk\nManagement (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit\nto execute its responsibilities. The\nBoard committees discussed below have\nthe principal responsibility for\nenterprise-wide oversight of our risk\nmanagement activities. Through these\nactivities, the Board and applicable\ncommittees are provided with information\non our risk profile and oversee senior\nmanagement addressing key risks we face.\nOther Board committees, as described\nbelow, provide additional oversight of\nspecific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the\nabove chart regularly reports to the\nBoard on risk-related matters within the\ncommittee\u2019s responsibilities, which is\nintended to collectively provide the\nBoard with integrated insight about our\nmanagement of enterprise-wide risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Audit Committee                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Audit Committee oversees the\nqualifications, performance and\nindependence of the Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, the\nperformance of our corporate audit\nfunction, the integrity of our\nconsolidated financial statements, our\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, and makes inquiries of\nsenior management or the Chief Audit\nExecutive (CAE) to determine whether\nthere are scope or resource limitations\nthat impede the ability of Corporate\nAudit to execute its responsibilities.\nThe Audit Committee is also responsible\nfor overseeing compliance risks pursuant\nto the New York Stock Exchange listing\nstandards.\n                                                                                  \n  Enterprise Risk Committee                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe ERC oversees the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, risk appetite and senior\nmanagement\u2019s responsibilities for the\nidentification, measurement, monitoring\nand control of key risks facing the\nCorporation. The ERC may consult with\nother Board committees on risk-related\nmatters.\n                                                                                  \n  Other Board Committees                                                          \n                                                                                  \nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee oversees our\nBoard\u2019s governance processes, identifies\nand reviews the qualifications of\npotential Board members, leads\n\nBoard and committee succession planning\nand their formal self-evaluation, and\nreviews our ESG activities, shareholder\ninput and shareholder engagement\nprocess.\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee oversees establishing,\nmaintaining and administering our\ncompensation programs and employee\nbenefit plans, including approving and\nrecommending our Chief Executive\nOfficer\u2019s (CEO) compensation to our\nBoard for further approval by all\nindependent directors; reviewing and\napproving our executive officers\u2019\ncompensation, as well as compensation\nfor non-management directors; and\nreviewing certain other human capital\nmanagement topics, including pay equity\nand diversity and inclusion.\n                                                                                  \n   Management Committees                                                          \n                                                                                  \nManagement committees receive their\nauthority from the Board, a Board\ncommittee, or another management\ncommittee. Our primary management risk\ncommittee is the MRC. Subject to Board\noversight, the MRC is responsible for\nmanagement oversight of key risks facing\nthe Corporation, including an integrated\nevaluation of risk, earnings, capital\nand liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  Lines of Defense                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe have clear ownership and\naccountability for managing risk across\nthree lines of defense: Front Line Units\n(FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also\nhave control functions outside of FLUs\nand GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human\nResources). The three lines of defense\nare integrated into our management-level\ngovernance structure. Each of these\nfunctional roles is further described in\nthis section.\n                                                                                  \n  Executive Officers                                                              \n                                                                                  \nExecutive officers lead various\nfunctions representing the functional\nroles. Authority for functional roles\nmay be delegated to executive officers\nfrom the Board, Board committees or\nmanagement-level committees. Executive\nofficers, in turn, may further delegate\nresponsibilities, as appropriate, to\nmanagement-level committees, management\nroutines or individuals. Executive\nofficers review our activities for\nconsistency with our Risk Framework,\nrisk appetite, and applicable strategic,\ncapital and financial operating plans,\nas well as applicable policies and\nstandards. Executive officers and other\nemployees make decisions individually on\na day-to-day basis, consistent with the\nauthority they have been delegated.\nExecutive officers and other employees\nmay also serve on committees and\nparticipate in committee decisions.\n                                                                                  \n  47Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Front Line Units                                                                \n                                                                                  \nFLUs, which include the lines of\nbusiness as well as Global Technology\nand Global Operations, are responsible\nfor appropriately assessing and\neffectively managing all of the risks\nassociated with their activities.\n\nThree organizational units that include\nFLU activities and control function\nactivities, but are not part of GRM are\nfirst, the Chief Financial Officer\nGroup; second, the Chief Administrative\nOfficer Group; and third, Global\nStrategy and Enterprise Platforms.\n                                                                                  \n   Global Risk Management                                                         \n                                                                                  \nGRM is part of our control functions and\noperates as our independent risk\nmanagement function. GRM, led by the\nChief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible\nfor independently assessing and\noverseeing risks within FLUs and other\ncontrol functions. GRM establishes\nwritten enterprise policies and\nprocedures outlining how aggregate risks\nare identified, measured, monitored and\ncontrolled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and\nindependence needed to develop and\nimplement a meaningful risk management\nframework and practices to guide the\nCorporation in managing risk. The CRO\nhas unrestricted access to the Board and\nreports directly to both the ERC and the\nCEO. GRM is organized into horizontal\nrisk teams that cover a specific risk\narea and vertical CRO teams that cover a\nparticular FLU or control function.\nThese teams work collaboratively in\nexecuting their respective duties.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporate Audit                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain\ntheir independence from the FLUs, GRM\nand other control functions by reporting\ndirectly to the Audit Committee. The CAE\nadministratively reports to the CEO.\nCorporate Audit provides independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key processes and controls\nacross the Corporation. Corporate Audit\nincludes Credit Review, which provides\nan independent assessment of credit\nlending decisions and the effectiveness\nof credit processes across the\nCorporation\u2019s credit platform through\nexaminations and monitoring.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Processes                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework requires that strong\nrisk management practices are integrated\nin key strategic, capital and financial\nplanning processes and in day-to-day\nbusiness processes across the\nCorporation, thereby ensuring risks are\nappropriately considered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely manner. We\nemploy an effective risk management\nprocess, referred to as Identify,\nMeasure, Monitor and Control, as part of\nour daily activities.\n\nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively managed,\nrisks must be proactively identified and\nwell understood. Proper risk\nidentification focuses on recognizing\nand understanding key risks inherent in\nour business activities or key risks\nthat may arise from external factors.\nEach employee is expected to identify\nand escalate risks promptly. Risk\nidentification is an ongoing process\nthat incorporates input from FLUs and\ncontrol functions. It is designed to be\nforward-looking and to capture relevant\nrisk factors across all of our lines of\nbusiness.\n\nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it\nmust be prioritized and accurately\nmeasured through a systematic process\nincluding qualitative statements and\nquantitative limits. Risk is measured at\nvarious levels, including, but not\nlimited to, risk type, FLU and legal\nentity, and also on an aggregate basis.\nThis risk measurement process helps to\ncapture changes in our risk profile due\nto changes in strategic direction,\n\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and\nthe overall economic environment. Senior\nmanagement considers how risk exposures\nmight evolve under a variety of stress\nscenarios.\n\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk levels\nregularly to track adherence to risk\nappetite, policies and standards. We\nalso regularly update risk assessments\nand review risk exposures. Through our\nmonitoring, we know our level of risk\nrelative to limits and can take action\nin a timely manner. We also know when\nrisk limits are breached and have\nprocesses to appropriately report and\nescalate exceptions. This includes\ntimely requests for approval to managers\nand alerts to executive management,\nmanagement-level committees or the Board\n(directly or through an appropriate\ncommittee).\n\nControl \u2013 We establish and communicate\nrisk limits and controls through\npolicies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses. The limits and controls can\nbe adjusted by senior management or the\nBoard when conditions or risk tolerances\nwarrant. These limits may be absolute\n(e.g., loan amount, trading volume,\noperational loss) or relative (e.g.,\npercentage of loan book in higher-risk\ncategories). Our FLUs are held\naccountable for performing within the\nestablished limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk\nrepresent a part of our overall risk\nmanagement process. We instill a strong\nand comprehensive culture of managing\nrisk well through communications,\ntraining, policies, procedures and\norganizational roles and\nresponsibilities. Establishing a culture\nreflective of our purpose to help make\nour customers\u2019 financial lives better\nand delivering on Responsible Growth is\nalso critical to effective risk\nmanagement. We are committed to the\nhighest principles of ethical and\nprofessional conduct. Conduct risk is\nthe risk of improper actions, behaviors\nor practices by the Corporation, its\nemployees or representatives that are\nillegal, unethical and/or contrary to\nour core values that could result in\nharm to the Corporation, our\nshareholders or our customers, damage\nthe integrity of the financial markets,\nor negatively impact our reputation. We\nhave established protocols and\nstructures so that conduct risk is\ngoverned and reported across the\nCorporation appropriately. All employees\nare held accountable for adhering to the\nCode of Conduct, operating within our\nrisk appetite and managing risk in their\ndaily business activities. In addition,\nour performance management and\ncompensation practices encourage\nresponsible risk-taking that is\nconsistent with our Risk Framework and\nrisk appetite.\n                                                                                  \n  Corporation-wide Stress Testing                                                 \n                                                                                  \nIntegral to our Capital Planning,\nFinancial Planning and Strategic\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital\nscenario management and stress\nforecasting on a periodic basis to\nbetter understand balance sheet,\nearnings and capital sensitivities to\ncertain economic and business scenarios,\nincluding economic and market conditions\nthat are more severe than anticipated.\nThese stress forecasts provide an\nunderstanding of the potential impacts\nfrom our risk profile on the balance\nsheet, earnings and capital, and serve\nas a key component of our capital and\nrisk management practices. The intent of\nstress testing is to develop a\ncomprehensive understanding of potential\nimpacts of on- and off-balance sheet\nrisks at the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries and how they impact\nfinancial resiliency, which provides\nconfidence to management, regulators and\nour investors.\n                                                                                  \n  Contingency Planning                                                            \n                                                                                  \nWe have developed and maintain\ncontingency plans that are designed to\nprepare us in advance to respond in the\nevent of\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America48                                                               \n                                                                                  \npotential adverse economic, financial or\nmarket stress.

This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate, such as competitor\nactions, changing customer preferences,\nproduct obsolescence and technology\ndevelopments.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk\nthat the Corporation\u2019s capital levels\nare not adequate to meet minimum\nregulatory requirements and support\nexecution of business activities or\nabsorb losses from risks during normal\nor adverse economic and market\nconditions. As such, capital risk is\nmanaged in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe manage strategic risk through the\nStrategic Risk Enterprise Policy and\nintegration into the strategic planning\nprocess, among other activities. Our\nstrategic plan is consistent with our\nrisk appetite, capital plan and\nliquidity requirements, and specifically\naddresses strategic risks impacting each\nbusiness.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews\nand approves the strategic plan, capital\nplan, financial operating plan and Risk\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by\nthe Board, senior management directs the\nlines of business to execute our\nstrategic plan consistent with our core\noperating principles and risk appetite.\nThe executive management team monitors\nbusiness performance throughout the year\nand provides the Board with regular\nprogress reports on whether strategic\nobjectives and timelines are being met,\nincluding reports on strategic risks and\nif additional or alternative actions\nneed to be considered or implemented.\nThe regular executive reviews focus on\nassessing forecasted earnings and\nreturns on capital, the current risk\nprofile, current capital and liquidity\nrequirements, staffing levels and\nchanges required to support the\nstrategic plan, stress testing results,\nand other qualitative factors such as\nmarket growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as\ncapital actions, material acquisitions\nor divestitures, and resolution plans\nare reviewed and approved by the Board.\nAt the business level, processes are in\nplace to discuss the strategic risk\nimplications of new, expanded or\nmodified businesses, products or\nservices and other strategic\ninitiatives, and to provide formal\nreview and approval where required. With\noversight by the Board and the ERC,\nexecutive management performs similar\nanalyses throughout the year, and\nevaluates changes to the financial\nforecast or the risk, capital or\nliquidity positions as deemed\nappropriate to balance and optimize\nachieving the targeted risk appetite,\nshareholder returns and maintaining the\ntargeted financial strength. Proprietary\nmodels are used to measure the capital\nrequirements for credit, country,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks.\nThe allocated capital assigned to each\nbusiness\n\nis based on its unique risk profile.\nWith oversight by the Board, executive\nmanagement assesses the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business in approving\nstrategic and financial operating plans.\nThe businesses use allocated capital to\ndefine business strategies, and price\nproducts and transactions.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning.\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety\nand soundness at all times, even under\nadverse scenarios, take advantage of\norganic growth opportunities, meet\nobligations to creditors and\ncounterparties, maintain ready access to\nfinancial markets, continue to serve as\na credit intermediary, remain a source\nof strength for our subsidiaries, and\nsatisfy current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements. Capital management\nis integrated into our risk and\ngovernance processes, as capital is a\nkey consideration in the development of\nour strategic plan, risk appetite and\nrisk limits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic\nbasis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking\nassessment of our projected capital\nneeds and resources, incorporating\nearnings, balance sheet and risk\nforecasts under baseline and adverse\neconomic and market conditions. We\nutilize periodic stress tests to assess\nthe potential impacts to our balance\nsheet, earnings, regulatory capital and\nliquidity under a variety of stress\nscenarios. We perform qualitative risk\nassessments to identify and assess\nmaterial risks not fully captured in our\nforecasts or stress tests. We assess the\npotential capital impacts of proposed\nchanges to regulatory capital\nrequirements. Management assesses ICAAP\nresults and provides documented\nquarterly assessments of the adequacy of\nour capital guidelines and capital\nposition to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital\nannually during the strategic and\ncapital planning processes.

Based on the\nresults of our 2022 CCAR stress test,\nour stress capital buffer (SCB)\nincreased to 3.4 percent from 2.5\npercent, effective October 1, 2022\nthrough September 30, 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized\nthe Corporation\u2019s $25 billion common\nstock repurchase program. Additionally,\nthe Board authorized common stock\nrepurchases to offset shares awarded\nunder the Corporation\u2019s equity-based\ncompensation plans. Pursuant to the\nBoard\u2019s authorizations, during 2022, we\nrepurchased $5.1 billion of common\nstock, including repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under equity-based\ncompensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  49Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. Basel 3 established\nminimum capital ratios and buffer\nrequirements and outlined two methods of\ncalculating risk-weighted assets (RWA),\nthe Standardized approach and the\nAdvanced approaches. The Standardized\napproach relies primarily on supervisory\nrisk weights based on exposure type, and\nthe Advanced approaches determine risk\nweights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nRWA under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The lower of the\ncapital ratios under Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements are used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the PCA\nframework. As of December 31, 2022, the\ncommon equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital ratios under\nthe Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirement was 9.5\npercent under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. Based on the\nresults of our 2022 CCAR stress test,\nthe Corporation\u2019s SCB increased to 3.4\npercent, resulting in a minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirement of 10.4\npercent under the Standardized approach\nfor the period from October 1, 2022\nthrough September 30, 2023. Our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the\nAdvanced approaches\n\nremains unchanged at 9.5 percent.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent from 2.5 percent on January 1,\n2024, which will increase our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Corporation\u2019s\nCET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent under\nthe Standardized approach exceeded its\ncurrent CET1 capital ratio requirement\nas well as the minimum requirement\nexpected to be in place as of January 1,\n2024 due to an anticipated increase in\nour G-SIB surcharge.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework. The numerator of the SLR\nis quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital.\nThe denominator is total leverage\nexposure based on the daily average of\nthe sum of on-balance sheet exposures\nless permitted deductions, and\napplicable temporary exclusions, as well\nas the simple average of certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, as of the end\nof each month in a quarter.\n

The SLR regulatory minimum\nincludes a leverage buffer of 2.0\npercent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, CET1 capital was\n$180.1 billion, an increase of $8.3\nbillion from December 31, 2021, due to\nearnings, partially offset by dividends,\ncommon stock repurchases and higher net\nunrealized losses on available-for-sale\ndebt securities included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income (OCI). Tier 1\ncapital increased $12.0 billion\nprimarily driven by the same factors as\nCET1 capital as well as non-cumulative\nperpetual preferred stock issuances.\nTotal capital under the Standardized\napproach increased $11.2 billion\nprimarily due to the same factors\ndriving the increase in\n\nTier 1 capital and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital, partially\noffset by a decrease in subordinated\ndebt. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at December 31, 2022,\ndecreased $13.0 billion during 2022 to\n$1,605 billion primarily due to lower\ncounterparty exposures in Global Markets\nand a decrease in debt securities in the\nTreasury portfolio, partially offset by\nloan growth. Supplementary leverage\nexposure at December 31, 2022 decreased\n$80.3 billion primarily due to lower\ndebt securities, driven by lower\ndeposits, partially offset by loan\ngrowth.\n

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge.

The Corporation's\nprincipal European broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are Merrill Lynch\nInternational (MLI) and BofA Securities\nEurope SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its minimum capital\nrequirements as an alternative net\ncapital broker-dealer under Rule\n15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute\ntheir minimum capital requirements in\naccordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are\nalso registered as futures commission\nmerchants and are subject to Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nRegulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also registered with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nDecember 31, 2022, BofAS had tentative\nnet capital of $20.9 billion. BofAS also\nhad regulatory net capital of $17.5\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nrequirement of $4.1 billion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary\nof BofAS and provides clearing and\nsettlement services as well as prime\nbrokerage and arranged financing\nservices for institutional clients. At\nDecember 31, 2022, MLPCC\u2019s regulatory\nnet capital of $7.5 billion exceeded the\nminimum requirement of $1.4 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nDecember 31, 2022, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $6.0 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $137\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are subject\nto requirements from U.S. and non-U.S.\nregulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm,\nis regulated by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority and is\nsubject to certain regulatory capital\nrequirements. At December 31, 2022,\nMLI\u2019s capital resources were $33.4\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nPillar 1 requirement of $11.6 billion.\n\nBofASE is an authorized credit\ninstitution with its head office located\nin France. Previously, BofASE had been\nauthorized as an investment firm, but\nfollowing the European Union\u2019s adoption\nof the harmonized Investment Firm\nDirective and Investment Firm Regulation\nprudential regime, it was required to\napply for reauthorization as a credit\ninstitution. The application was\napproved in November 2022 and became\neffective on December 8, 2022.

At December 31, 2022,\nBofASE's capital resources were $9.0\nbillion, which exceeded the minimum\nPillar 1 requirement of $3.0 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became\nconditionally registered with the SEC as\nsecurity-based swap dealers in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, and maintained\nnet liquid assets at December 31, 2022\nthat exceeded the applicable minimum\nrequirements under the Exchange Act.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity Risk                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management                                           \n                                                                                  \nOur primary liquidity risk management\nobjective is to meet expected or\nunexpected cash flow and collateral\nrequirements, including payments under\nlong-term debt agreements, commitments\nto extend credit and customer deposit\nwithdrawals, while continuing to support\nour businesses and customers under a\nrange of economic conditions. To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nfluctuation from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand macroeconomic environment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line-of-business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \n(including intraday) basis under both\nexpected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity management\nenhances our ability to monitor\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events. The Board approves\nour liquidity risk policy and the\nFinancial Contingency and Recovery Plan.\nThe ERC establishes our liquidity risk\ntolerance levels. The MRC is responsible\nfor overseeing liquidity risks and\ndirecting management to maintain\nexposures within the established\ntolerance levels. The MRC reviews and\nmonitors our liquidity position and\nstress testing results, approves certain\nliquidity risk limits and reviews the\nimpact of strategic decisions on our\nliquidity. For more information, see\nManaging Risk on page 46. Under this\ngovernance framework, we developed\ncertain funding and liquidity risk\nmanagement practices which include:\nmaintaining liquidity at Bank of America\nCorporation (Parent) and selected\nsubsidiaries, including our bank\nsubsidiaries and other regulated\nentities; determining what amounts of\nliquidity are appropriate for these\nentities based on analysis of debt\nmaturities and other potential cash\noutflows, including those that we may\nexperience during stressed market\nconditions; diversifying funding\nsources, considering our asset profile\nand legal entity structure; and\nperforming contingency planning. NB\nHoldings Corporation The Parent, which\nis a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our bank and nonbank subsidiaries,\nhas an intercompany arrangement with our\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).\nWe have transferred, and agreed to\ntransfer, additional Parent assets not\nrequired to satisfy anticipated near-\nterm expenditures to NB Holdings. The\nParent is expected to continue to have\naccess to the same flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts of cash\nnecessary to service its debt, pay\ndividends and perform other obligations\nas it would have had it not entered into\nthese arrangements and transferred any\nassets. These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. In consideration\nfor the transfer of assets, NB Holdings\nissued a subordinated note to the Parent\nin a principal amount equal to the value\nof the transferred assets. The aggregate\nprincipal amount of the note will\nincrease by the amount of any future\nasset transfers. NB Holdings also\nprovided the Parent with a committed\nline of credit that allows the Parent to\ndraw funds necessary to service near-\nterm cash needs. These arrangements\nsupport our preferred single point of\nentry resolution strategy, under which\nonly the Parent would be resolved under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These\narrangements include provisions to\nterminate the line of credit, forgive\nthe subordinated note and require the\nParent to transfer its remaining\nfinancial assets to NB Holdings if our\nprojected liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nof the Parent becomes imminent. Global\nLiquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered\nAssets We maintain liquidity available\nto the Corporation, including the Parent\nand selected subsidiaries, in the form\nof cash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of\n\nassets that are readily available to the\nParent and selected subsidiaries,\nincluding holding company, bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries, even during\nstressed market conditions. Our cash is\nprimarily on deposit with the Federal\nReserve Bank and, to a lesser extent,\ncentral banks outside of the U.S. We\nlimit the composition of high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency MBS and other\ninvestment-grade securities, and a\nselect group of non-U.S. government\nsecurities.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained by borrowing\nagainst this pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was $348\nbillion and $322 billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\nTable 16 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  55Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                        Average Global                                            \n  Table 16              Liquidity                 Three Months Ended              \n  (Dollars in           Sources                          December 31              \n  billions)             Composition                             2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on deposit                             $                  174    $    259  \n  U.S. Treasury                                                  252         278  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-backed                                                                 \n  securities, and                                                427         606  \n  other                                                                           \n  investment-grade                                                                \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                                      15          15  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                            $                  868    $  1,158  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nrules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $605 billion and $617 billion for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the same periods, the average\nconsolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal\nbusiness flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize\nliquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of\nliquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and\nutilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including\npotential credit rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more\nsevere events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on\nour historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial\ninstitutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our\nscenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of\nunsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured\nfinancing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan\ncommitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral\nthat counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral\nand margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity\nrequired to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in\ncertain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades,\ncould negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the\nrelated financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material\nto our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access\nduring each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources\nwith corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress\nmodeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits\nand guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Net Stable Funding Ratio\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to\nmaintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement\nis intended to support\n\nthe ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and\nadverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on\nshort-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a\nconsolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At December 31,\n2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance\nwith this requirement. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily\nwith a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a\ncentralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products,\nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our\ncentralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider\nname recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding\nrequirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other\nbusiness considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other\nsubsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our\nlending activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1\ntrillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Deposits are primarily generated by our\nConsumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified\nby clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are\ninsured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a\nstable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding\nis generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes\nin our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may\nalso be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations\nand securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a\nsecured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these\namounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe\nfunding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient\nand less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing.\nRepurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in\nsecured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market\ncycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the\navailability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured\nfunding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties,\nproviding a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when\nappropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 \u2013\nSecurities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted\nCash to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total long-term debt decreased $4.1\nbillion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities,\nredemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may,\nfrom time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated\nentities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for\ninvestors. During 2022, we issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of\n$44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of\nwhich were TLAC compliant,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America56                                                               \n                                                                                  \n$10.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of\nAmerica, N.A. and $11.8 billion of other\ndebt. During 2021, we issued $76.7\nbillion of long-term debt consisting of\n$56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of\nAmerica Corporation, substantially all\nof which were TLAC compliant, $8 billion\nof notes issued by Bank of America, N.A.\nand $12.5 billion of other debt. During\n2022, we had total long-term debt\nmaturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of\n$19.8 billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of\nAmerica, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other\ndebt. During 2021, we had total long-\nterm debt maturities and redemptions in\nthe aggregate of $46.4 billion\nconsisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of\nAmerica Corporation, $10.4 billion for\nBank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion\nof other debt. At December 31, 2022,\nBank of America Corporation's senior\nnotes of $205.9 billion included $179.1\nbillion of outstanding notes that are\nboth TLAC eligible and callable at least\none year before their stated maturities.\nOf these senior notes, $16.6 billion\nwill be callable and become TLAC\nineligible during 2023, and $21.4\nbillion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion\nand $24.4 billion will do so during each\nof 2024 through 2027, respectively, and\n$79.4 billion thereafter. We issue long-\nterm unsecured debt in a variety of\nmaturities and currencies to achieve\ncost-efficient funding and to maintain\nan appropriate maturity profile. While\nthe cost and availability of unsecured\nfunding may be negatively impacted by\ngeneral market conditions or by matters\nspecific to the financial services\nindustry or the Corporation, we seek to\nmitigate refinancing risk by actively\nmanaging the amount of our borrowings\nthat we anticipate will mature within\nany month or quarter. We may issue\nunsecured debt in the form of structured\nnotes for client purposes, certain of\nwhich qualify as TLAC-eligible debt.\nDuring 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. We typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to pay on these\nliabilities with derivatives and/or\ninvestments in the underlying\ninstruments, so that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured\nnote obligations for cash or other\nsecurities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate. Substantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt obligations\ncontain no provisions that could trigger\na requirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. We use derivative\ntransactions to manage the duration,\ninterest rate and currency risks of our\nborrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Contingency Planning\nWe maintain contingency funding plans\nthat outline our potential responses to\nliquidity stress events at various\nlevels of severity. These policies and\nplans are based on stress scenarios and\ninclude potential funding strategies and\ncommunication and notification\nprocedures that we would implement in\nthe event we experienced stressed\nliquidity conditions. We periodically\nreview and test the contingency funding\nplans to validate efficacy and assess\nreadiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries\ncan access contingency funding through\nthe Federal Reserve Discount Window.\nCertain non-U.S. subsidiaries have\naccess to central bank facilities in the\njurisdictions in which they operate.\nWhile we do not rely on these sources in\nour liquidity modeling, we maintain the\npolicies, procedures and governance\nprocesses that would enable us to access\nthese sources if necessary. Credit\nRatings Our borrowing costs and ability\nto raise funds are impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition, credit\nratings may be important to customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and when we seek to\nengage in certain transactions,\nincluding over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives. Thus, it is our objective\nto maintain high-quality credit ratings,\nand management maintains an active\ndialogue with the major rating agencies.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions\nexpressed by rating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of our\nobligations or securities, including\nlong-term debt, short-term borrowings,\npreferred stock and other securities,\nincluding asset securitizations. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview by the rating agencies, and they\nconsider a number of factors, including\nour own financial strength, performance,\nprospects and operations as well as\nfactors not under our control. The\nrating agencies could make adjustments\nto our ratings at any\n                                                                                  \n  57Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ntime, and they provide no assurances\nthat they will maintain our ratings at\ncurrent levels .\n\nOther factors that influence our credit\nratings include changes to the rating\nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry\nor certain security types; the rating\nagencies\u2019 assessment of the general\noperating environment for financial\nservices companies; our relative\npositions in the markets in which we\ncompete; our various risk exposures and\nrisk management policies and activities;\npending litigation and other\ncontingencies or potential tail risks;\nour reputation; our liquidity position,\ndiversity of funding sources and funding\ncosts; the current and expected level\nand volatility of our earnings; our\ncapital position and capital management\npractices; our corporate governance; the\nsovereign credit ratings of the U.S.\ngovernment; current or future regulatory\nand legislative initiatives; and the\nagencies\u2019 views on whether the U.S.\ngovernment would provide meaningful\nsupport to the Corporation or its\nsubsidiaries in a crisis.\n\nOn September 19, 2022, Fitch Ratings\n(Fitch) affirmed the long-term and\nshort-term senior debt ratings of the\nCorporation. Fitch also affirmed and\nwithdrew the long-term and short-term\nratings on certain subsidiaries, as they\nare no longer considered relevant to the\nagency\u2019s coverage.\n\nOn January 23, 2023, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService (Moody\u2019s) placed the long-term\nrating of the Corporation as well as the\nlong-term rating of its rated\nsubsidiaries, including BANA, on review\nfor upgrade. The agency cited the\nCorporation\u2019s strengthened capital\nratios, improved earnings profile and\ncontinued commitment to maintaining a\nrestrained risk appetite as drivers of\nthe review. A review for upgrade\nindicates that those ratings are under\nconsideration for a change in the near\nterm and typically concludes within 90\ndays. Moody\u2019s concurrently affirmed all\nPrime-1 short-term ratings of the\nCorporation and rated subsidiaries.\n\nThe current ratings and outlooks for the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries from\nStandard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings (S&P)\nwere not the subject of any rating\nactions during 2022 or through February\n22, 2023.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation\u2019s\ncurrent long-term/short-term senior debt\nratings and outlooks expressed by the\nrating agencies.\n                                                                                  \n  Ta\u2026    Se\u2026                                                                      \n  18     De\u2026                                                                      \n         Ra\u2026                                                                      \n                                       St\u2026                                        \n                Moo\u2026                   &                     Fit\u2026                 \n                Inv\u2026                   Po\u2026                   Rat\u2026                 \n                Ser\u2026                   Gl\u2026                                        \n                                       Ra\u2026                                        \n                Lon\u2026    Sh\u2026    Out\u2026    Lo\u2026    Sho\u2026    Ou\u2026    Lon\u2026    Sh\u2026    Out\u2026  \n  Ba\u2026                          Rev\u2026                                               \n  of            A2      P-1    for     A-     A-2     Po\u2026    AA-     F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Am\u2026                          Upg\u2026                                               \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  Ba\u2026                          Rev\u2026                                               \n  of            Aa2     P-1    for     A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Am\u2026                          Upg\u2026                                               \n  N.\u2026                                                                             \n  Ba\u2026                                                                             \n  of                                                                              \n  Am\u2026                                                                             \n  Eu\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  Ac\u2026                                                                             \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  Me\u2026                                                                             \n  Ly\u2026                                                                             \n  Pi\u2026                                                                             \n  Fe\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  &                                                                               \n  Sm\u2026                                                                             \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  Se\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Me\u2026                                                                             \n  Ly\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  Se\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Eu\u2026                                                                             \n  SA                                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNR = not rated\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit\nratings or the ratings of certain asset-\nbacked securitizations may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our\nliquidity, potential loss of access to\ncredit markets, the related cost of\nfunds, our businesses and on certain\nrevenues, particularly in those\nbusinesses where counterparty\ncreditworthiness is critical. In\naddition, under the terms of certain OTC\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements, in the event of downgrades\nof our or our rated subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings, the counterparties to those\nagreements may require us to provide\nadditional collateral, or to terminate\nthese contracts or agreements, which\ncould cause us to sustain losses and/or\nadversely impact our liquidity. If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our Parent,\nbank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were\ndowngraded by one or more levels, the\npotential loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing\nand the effect on our incremental cost\nof funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nscope of the consequences of a credit\nrating downgrade to a financial\ninstitution is inherently uncertain, as\nit depends upon numerous dynamic,\ncomplex and inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including whether any\ndowngrade of a company\u2019s long-term\ncredit ratings precipitates downgrades\nto its short-term credit ratings, and\nassumptions about the potential\nbehaviors of various customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.

If holders of the Guaranteed\nSecurities make claims on their\nGuaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy,\nresolution or similar proceeding, any\nrecoveries on those claims will be\nlimited to those available under the\napplicable guarantee by the Corporation,\nas described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and\ndepends upon its subsidiaries for\nliquidity. Applicable laws and\nregulations and intercompany\narrangements entered into in connection\nwith the Corporation\u2019s resolution plan\ncould restrict the availability of funds\nfrom subsidiaries to the Corporation,\nwhich could adversely affect the\nCorporation\u2019s ability to make payments\nunder its guarantees. In addition, the\nobligations of the Corporation under the\nguarantees of the Guaranteed Securities\nwill be structurally subordinated to all\nexisting and future liabilities of its\nsubsidiaries, and claimants should look\nonly to assets of the Corporation for\npayments. If the Corporation, as\nguarantor of the Guaranteed Notes,\ntransfers all or substantially all of\nits assets to one or more direct or\nindirect majority-owned subsidiaries,\nunder the indenture governing the\nGuaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries will not be required to\nassume the Corporation\u2019s obligations\nunder its guarantee of the Guaranteed\nNotes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may\naffect payments to holders of the\nGuaranteed Securities, see Liquidity\nRisk \u2013 NB Holdings Corporation in this\nsection, Item 1.

Credit risk can also arise\nfrom operational failures that result in\nan erroneous advance, commitment or\ninvestment of funds. We define the\ncredit exposure to a borrower or\ncounterparty as the loss potential\narising from all product classifications\nincluding loans and leases, deposit\noverdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending\ncommitments, which include loan\ncommitments, letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees. Derivative\npositions are recorded at fair value,\nand assets held-for-sale are recorded at\neither fair value or the lower of cost\nor\n\nfair value. Certain loans and unfunded\ncommitments are accounted for under the\nfair value option. Credit risk for\ncategories of assets carried at fair\nvalue is not accounted for as part of\nthe allowance for credit losses but as\npart of the fair value adjustments\nrecorded in earnings. For derivative\npositions, our credit risk is measured\nas the net cost in the event the\ncounterparties with contracts in which\nwe are in a gain position fail to\nperform under the terms of those\ncontracts. We use the current fair value\nto represent credit exposure without\ngiving consideration to future mark-to-\nmarket changes. The credit risk amounts\ntake into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting\nagreements and cash collateral. Our\nconsumer and commercial credit extension\nand review procedures encompass funded\nand unfunded credit exposures. For more\ninformation on derivatives and credit\nextension commitments, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives and Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower or counterparty,\nrepayment sources, the nature of\nunderlying collateral and other support\ngiven current events, conditions and\nexpectations. We classify our portfolios\nas either consumer or commercial and\nmonitor credit risk in each as discussed\nbelow.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit\nrisk management practices as well as\ncredit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses\nand enhance customer support in our\nconsumer businesses, we have in place\ncollection programs and loan\nmodification and customer assistance\ninfrastructures. We utilize a number of\nactions to mitigate losses in the\ncommercial businesses including\nincreasing the frequency and intensity\nof portfolio monitoring, hedging\nactivity and our practice of\ntransferring management of deteriorating\ncommercial exposures to independent\nspecial asset officers as credits enter\ncriticized categories.\n\nDuring 2022, asset quality generally\nimproved compared to 2021. Our 2022 net\ncharge-off ratio remained near historic\nlows, and nonperforming loans and\ncommercial reservable criticized\nutilized exposure decreased compared to\n2021, which was partially offset by an\nincrease in reservable criticized\nexposure associated with our direct\nexposure to Russia as a result of the\nRussia/Ukraine conflict. While\nuncertainty around the pandemic has\ndiminished, uncertainty remains\nregarding broader economic impacts as a\nresult of inflationary pressures, rising\nrates and the current geopolitical\nsituation and could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality metrics in\nfuture periods.\n\nFor information on our credit risk\nmanagement activities, see Consumer\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management below,\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement on page 64, Non-U.S.\nPortfolio on page 70, Allowance for\nCredit Losses on page 73, and Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and\nAllowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.

Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external\n                                                                                  \n  59Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nsources, such as credit bureaus, and/or\ninternal historical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process.

During 2022, net\ncharge-offs were $1.9 billion,\nrelatively unchanged compared to 2021.\nDuring 2022, nonperforming loans\ndeclined primarily due to\n\ndecreases from consumer real estate loan\nsales, partially offset by increases\nfrom loans whose prior-period deferrals\nexpired and were modified in troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs) during the\nfirst quarter of 2022.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses increased $204 million\nduring 2022 to $7.2 billion.

which primarily\nconsist of collateral-dependent TDRs,\nincluding those that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and\nloans that have not yet demonstrated a\nsustained period of payment performance\nfollowing a TDR.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\ndecreased $117 million in 2022 primarily\ndue to decreases from consumer real\nestate loan sales in the second quarter\nof 2022, partially offset by increases\nfrom loans whose prior-period deferrals\nexpired and were modified in TDRs during\nthe first quarter of 2022. Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat December 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or\n63 percent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more decreased $22 million.\n\nNet charge-offs of $72 million for 2022\nincreased $100 million compared to 2021\nprimarily due to loan sales that\noccurred in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nOf the $218.0 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat December 31, 2022, 28 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period was $3.4\nbillion, or six percent, at December 31,\n2022. Residential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization period\ngenerally experience a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At December 31, 2022, $64\nmillion, or two percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only\n\nresidential mortgages that had entered\nthe amortization period were accruing\npast due 30 days or more compared to\n$844 million, or less than one percent,\nfor the entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at December 31,\n2022, $204 million, or six percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered the\namortization period were nonperforming,\nof which $79 million were contractually\ncurrent. Loans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are\nprimarily well-collateralized loans to\nour wealth management clients and have\nan interest-only period of three to ten\nyears. Approximately 96 percent of these\nloans that have yet to enter the\namortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until\n2025 or later.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 14 percent\nand 15 percent of outstandings at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. In the New\nYork area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island MSA made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both December\n31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                  \n         Res\u2026                                                                     \n  Ta\u2026    Mor\u2026                                                                     \n  22     Sta\u2026                                                                     \n         Con\u2026                                                                     \n                    Out\u2026                  Non\u2026                                    \n                    Dec\u2026                                          Net             \n                      31                                         Cha\u2026             \n  (D\u2026               Dec\u2026       Dec\u2026       Dec\u2026       Dece\u2026                        \n  in                  31         31         31          31       2022       2021  \n  mi\u2026               2022       2021       2022        2021                        \n  Ca\u2026            $  80,\u2026    $  77,\u2026    $   656    $    693    $    37    $   -14  \n  New               26,\u2026       24,\u2026        328         358          7          3  \n  Yo\u2026                                                                             \n  Fl\u2026               15,\u2026       13,\u2026        145         158         -2         -8  \n  Te\u2026               9,3\u2026       9,0\u2026         88          86          \u2014          \u2014  \n  New               8,8\u2026       8,7\u2026         96         117          3          \u2014  \n  Je\u2026                                                                             \n  Ot\u2026               77,\u2026       74,\u2026        854         872         27         -9  \n  Re\u2026                                                                             \n  mo\u2026            $  217\u2026    $  209\u2026    $  2,1\u2026    $  2,284    $    72    $   -28  \n  lo\u2026                                                                             \n  Fu\u2026                                                                             \n  lo\u2026               11,\u2026       12,\u2026                                               \n  po\u2026                                                                             \n  To\u2026                                                                             \n  re\u2026                                                                             \n  mo\u2026            $  229\u2026    $  221\u2026                                               \n  lo\u2026                                                                             \n  po\u2026                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt December 31, 2022, the home equity\nportfolio made up six percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10\n\nyears, and after the initial draw period\nends, the loans generally convert to 15-\nor 20-year amortizing loans.

Of\nthe nonperforming home equity loans at\nDecember 31, 2022, $275 million, or 54\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $167 million, or\n33 percent, of nonperforming home equity\nloans were 180 days or more past due and\nhad been written down to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, less costs\nto sell. Accruing loans that were 30\ndays or more past due decreased $61\nmillion in 2022.\n\nNet recoveries decreased $29 million to\n$90 million in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nOf the $26.6 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nDecember 31, 2022, as shown in Table 23,\n13 percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that had reached the end of their\ndraw period and entered the amortization\nperiod was $5.2 billion at December 31,\n2022. The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At December 31, 2022, $53\nmillion, or one percent, of outstanding\nHELOCs that\n\nhad entered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more. In\naddition, at December 31, 2022, $354\nmillion, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During 2022, 10 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 24 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio. In the New York area, the New\nYork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA\nmade up 12 percent and 13 percent of the\noutstanding home equity portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve a\nreduction in the customer\u2019s interest\nrate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other\nconsumer loans are made through programs\nutilizing direct customer contact, but\nmay also utilize external programs. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, our credit\ncard and other consumer TDR portfolio\nwas $624 million and $672 million, of\nwhich $540 million and $599 million were\ncurrent or less than 30 days past due\nunder the modified terms.\n                                                                                  \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                    \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the\ncommercial portfolio begins with an\nassessment of the credit risk profile of\nthe borrower or counterparty based on an\nanalysis of its financial position. As\npart of the overall credit risk\nassessment, our commercial credit\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and\nare subject to approval based on defined\ncredit approval standards. Subsequent to\nloan origination, risk ratings are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis, and if\nnecessary, adjusted to reflect changes\nin the financial condition, cash flow,\nrisk profile or outlook of a borrower or\ncounterparty. In making credit\ndecisions, we consider risk rating,\ncollateral, country, industry and\nsingle-name concentration limits while\nalso balancing these considerations with\nthe total borrower or counterparty\nrelationship. We use a variety of tools\nto continuously monitor the ability of a\nborrower or counterparty to perform\nunder its obligations. We use risk\nrating aggregations\n\nto measure and evaluate concentrations\nwithin portfolios. In addition, risk\nratings are a factor in determining the\nlevel of allocated capital and the\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation\ninitiatives, we attempt to work with\nclients experiencing financial\ndifficulty to modify their loans to\nterms that better align with their\ncurrent ability to pay. In situations\nwhere an economic concession has been\ngranted to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, we identify these\nloans as TDRs. For more information on\nour accounting policies regarding\ndelinquencies, nonperforming status and\nnet charge-offs for the commercial\nportfolio, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement of Commercial Credit Risk\nConcentrations\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For more information\non our industry concentrations, see\nTable 36\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America64                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Industry Concentrations on\npage 68.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate\nloans and loan commitments, including\nissued but unfunded letters of credit\nwhich are considered utilized for credit\nrisk management purposes, that exceed\nour single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair\nvalue option. Lending commitments, both\nfunded and unfunded, are actively\nmanaged and monitored, and as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith our credit view and market\nperspectives determining the size and\ntiming of the hedging activity. In\naddition, we purchase credit protection\nto cover the funded portion as well as\nthe unfunded portion of certain other\ncredit exposures. To lessen the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection\nlevels, credit exposure may be added\nwithin an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. These credit derivatives do\nnot meet the requirements for treatment\nas accounting hedges. They are carried\nat fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and\nother countries. As a member, we may be\nrequired to pay a pro-rata share of the\nlosses incurred by some of these\norganizations as a result of another\nmember default and under other loss\nscenarios.

Outstanding\n\ncommercial loans and leases increased\n$45.9 billion during 2022 due to growth\nin commercial and industrial, primarily\nin Global Banking . This increase was\npartially offset by lower U.S. small\nbusiness commercial loans due to\nrepayments of PPP loans by the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) under the\nterms of the program.\n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate\nborrowers generally improved from 2021\nas pandemic-impacted sectors are\nrecovering. However, many commercial\nreal estate markets, while improving,\nare still experiencing disruptions in\ndemand, supply chain challenges, tenant\ndifficulties and challenging capital\nmarkets. Demand for office space\ncontinues to be uncertain as companies\nevaluate space needs with employment\nmodels that utilize a mix of remote and\nconventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses remained relatively\nunchanged at $5.4 billion at December\n31, 2022, as loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook were offset by\nasset quality improvement and a reserve\nrelease for reduced pandemic\nuncertainties. For more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on page 73.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $51.3 billion during\n2022 to $704.9 billion primarily driven\nby higher loans and leases and\nderivative assets. The utilization rate\nfor loans and leases, standby letters of\ncredit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees,\nand commercial letters of credit, in the\naggregate, was 56 percent at both\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nTable 29 presents commercial credit\nexposure by type for utilized, unfunded\nand total binding committed credit\nexposure. Commercial utilized credit\nexposure includes SBLCs and financial\nguarantees and commercial letters of\ncredit that have been issued and for\nwhich we are legally bound to advance\nfunds under prescribed conditions during\na specified time period, and excludes\nexposure related to trading account\nassets.

To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, net notional credit default\nprotection purchased in our credit\nderivatives portfolio to hedge our\nfunded and unfunded exposures for which\nwe elected the fair value option, as\nwell as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $9.0 billion and $2.6 billion. We\nrecorded net losses of $37 million in\n2022 compared to net losses $91 million\nin 2021.

(2) Ratings are refreshed\non a quarterly basis. (3) Ratings of BBB- or higher are considered to meet the\ndefinition of investment grade. (4) NR is comprised of index positions held and\nany names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default\nprotection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit\nexposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients\nand establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value\nchanges. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market\nwith large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to\na lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are\nexecuted in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject\nto credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the\nterms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk,\nwe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative\nassets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit\nderivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events\nsuch as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of\ncredit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral\nrequired by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional\nprotective measures such as early termination of all\n\ntrades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk\nvaluation adjustments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are\nsubject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from\nunfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in\nplace to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to\nthe direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures\nare managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and\noperational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. Table 39\npresents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2022. These\nexposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both December\n31, 2022 and 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $24.0\nbillion in 2022 primarily driven by increases in Germany, Japan, Ireland, India\nand Switzerland, partially offset by decreases in China, Belgium, Australia and\nSingapore. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and\nincludes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other\ninvestments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Funded loans\nand loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and\nfunds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments\nare the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan\nequivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives,\nincluding the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and\nsecured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at\nfair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with\nthe same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure\nrepresents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased,\nnet of credit default protection sold.\n

largest non-U.S. country exposure at\nDecember 31, 2022 was the United Kingdom\nwith net exposure of $55.3 billion,\nwhich represents an increase of $376\nmillion from December 31, 2021. The\nincrease was primarily driven by net\ncounterparty exposure with financial\ninstitutions, partially offset by a\nreduction in deposits with the central\nbank. Our second largest non-U.S.\ncountry exposure was Germany with net\nexposure of $45.7 billion at December\n31, 2022, an increase of $11.9 billion\nfrom December 31, 2021. The increase was\ndriven by higher deposits with the\ncentral bank and increased exposure with\nfinancial institutions and corporates.\n                                                                                  \n  Loan and Lease Contractual Maturities                                           \n                                                                                  \nTable 40 disaggregates total outstanding\nloans and leases by remaining scheduled\nprincipal due dates and interest rates.\nThe amounts provided do not reflect\nprepayment assumptions or hedging\nactivities related to the loan\nportfolio.

2021\nwere $2.2 billion as credit card losses,\nwhich remained near historic lows, were\npartially offset by higher overdrafts\ncharged off in other consumer due to\npayment activity related to checking\naccounts. The provision for credit\nlosses increased $7.1 billion to an\nexpense of $2.5 billion during 2022\ncompared to 2021. The provision for\ncredit losses in 2022 was primarily\ndriven by loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset\nby a reserve release for reduced\npandemic uncertainties. The provision\nfor credit losses for the consumer\nportfolio, including unfunded lending\ncommitments, increased $3.2 billion to\nan expense of $2.0 billion during 2022\ncompared to 2021. The\n\nprovision for credit losses for the\ncommercial portfolio, including unfunded\nlending commitments, increased $3.9\nbillion to an expense of $495 million\nfor 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nTable 42 presents a rollforward of the\nallowance for credit losses, including\ncertain loan and allowance ratios for\n2022 and 2021.

impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results. For more information, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 79.\n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit\nproducts are non-trading positions and\nare generally reported at amortized cost\nfor assets or the amount owed for\nliabilities (historical cost). However,\nthese positions are still subject to\nchanges in economic value based on\nvarying market conditions, with one of\nthe primary risks being changes in the\nlevels of interest rates. The risk of\nadverse changes in the economic value of\nour non-trading positions arising from\nchanges in interest rates is managed\nthrough our ALM activities. We have\nelected to account for certain assets\nand liabilities under the fair value\noption.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at\nfair value with changes reflected in\nincome. Trading positions are subject to\nvarious changes in market-based risk\nfactors. The majority of this risk is\ngenerated by our activities in the\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, credit,\nequity and commodities markets. In\naddition, the values of assets and\nliabilities could change due to market\nliquidity, correlations across markets\nand expectations of market volatility.\nWe seek to manage these risk exposures\nby using a variety of techniques that\nencompass a broad range of financial\ninstruments. The key risk management\ntechniques are discussed in more detail\nin the Trading Risk Management section.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior\nmanagement with a clear and\ncomprehensive understanding of the\ntrading risks to which we are exposed.\nThese responsibilities include ownership\nof market risk policy, developing and\nmaintaining quantitative risk models,\ncalculating aggregated risk measures,\nestablishing and monitoring position\nlimits consistent with risk appetite,\nconducting daily reviews and analysis of\ntrading inventory, approving material\nrisk exposures and fulfilling regulatory\nrequirements. Market risks that impact\nbusinesses outside of Global Markets are\nmonitored and governed by their\nrespective governance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse\nconsequences from decisions based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and\nreports. Given that models are used\nacross the Corporation, model risk\nimpacts all risk types including credit,\nmarket and operational risks. The\nEnterprise Model Risk Policy defines\nmodel risk standards, consistent with\nour Risk Framework and risk appetite,\nprevailing regulatory guidance and\nindustry best practice. All models,\nincluding risk management, valuation and\nregulatory capital models, must meet\ncertain validation criteria, including\neffective challenge of the conceptual\nsoundness of the model, independent\nmodel testing and ongoing monitoring\nthrough outcomes analysis and\nbenchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk\nCommittee, a subcommittee of the MRC,\noversees that model standards are\nconsistent with model risk requirements\nand monitors the effective challenge in\nthe model validation process across the\nCorporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Interest Rate Risk                                                              \n                                                                                  \nInterest rate risk represents exposures\nto instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest\nrates. These instruments include, but\nare not limited to, loans, debt\n\nsecurities, certain trading-related\nassets and liabilities, deposits,\nborrowings and derivatives. Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate these risks\ninclude derivatives such as options,\nfutures, forwards and swaps.\n                                                                                  \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                                                           \n                                                                                  \nForeign exchange risk represents\nexposures to changes in the values of\ncurrent holdings and future cash flows\ndenominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar.

The values of these\ninstruments are sensitive to prepayment\nrates, mortgage rates, agency debt\nratings, default, market liquidity,\ngovernment participation and interest\nrate volatility. Our exposure to these\ninstruments takes several forms. For\nexample, we trade and engage in market-\nmaking activities in a variety of\nmortgage securities including whole\nloans, pass-through certificates,\ncommercial mortgages and collateralized\nmortgage obligations including\ncollateralized debt obligations using\nmortgages as underlying collateral. In\naddition, we originate a variety of MBS,\nwhich involves the accumulation of\nmortgage-related loans in anticipation\nof eventual securitization, and we may\nhold positions in mortgage securities\nand residential mortgage loans as part\nof the ALM portfolio. We also record\nMSRs as part of our mortgage origination\nactivities. Hedging instruments used to\nmitigate this risk include derivatives\nsuch as options, swaps, futures and\nforwards as well as securities including\nMBS and U.S. Treasury securities.

We\nutilize various risk mitigating\ntechniques as discussed in more detail\nin Trading Risk Management.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. Various\ntechniques and procedures are utilized\nto enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks.\nQuantitative measures of market risk are\nevaluated on a daily basis from a single\nposition to the portfolio of the\nCorporation. These measures include\nsensitivities of positions to various\nmarket risk factors, such as the\npotential impact on revenue from a one\nbasis point change in interest rates,\nand statistical measures utilizing both\nactual and hypothetical market moves,\nsuch as VaR and stress testing. Periods\nof extreme market stress influence the\nreliability of these techniques to\nvarying degrees. Qualitative evaluations\nof market risk utilize the suite of\nquantitative risk measures while\nunderstanding each of their respective\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers\nindependently evaluate the risk of the\nportfolios under the current market\nenvironment and potential future\nenvironments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to\nmeasure market risk as it allows the\naggregation of market risk factors,\nincluding the effects of portfolio\ndiversification. A VaR model simulates\nthe value of a portfolio under a range\nof scenarios in order to generate a\ndistribution of potential gains and\nlosses. VaR represents the loss a\nportfolio is not expected to exceed more\nthan a certain number of times per\nperiod, based on a specified holding\nperiod, confidence level and window of\nhistorical data. We use one VaR model\nconsistently across the trading\nportfolios and it uses a historical\nsimulation approach based on a three-\nyear window of historical data. Our\nprimary VaR statistic is equivalent to a\n99 percent confidence level, which means\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding\nperiod, there should not be losses in\nexcess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100\ntrading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are\nsignificant and numerous assumptions\nthat will differ from company to\ncompany. The accuracy of a VaR model\ndepends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk\nfactors in the portfolio. A VaR model\nmay require additional modeling\nassumptions for new products that do not\nhave the necessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid positions for\nwhich accurate daily prices are not\nconsistently available. For positions\nwith insufficient historical data for\nthe VaR calculation, the process for\nestablishing an appropriate proxy is\nbased on fundamental and\n\nstatistical analysis of the new product\nor less liquid position. This analysis\nidentifies reasonable alternatives that\nreplicate both the expected volatility\nand correlation to other market risk\nfactors that the missing data would be\nexpected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized\nrevenue volatility as changes in market\nconditions or in the composition of the\nportfolio can have a material impact on\nthe results. In particular, the\nhistorical data used for the VaR\ncalculation might indicate higher or\nlower levels of portfolio\ndiversification than will be\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model\nto reflect current market conditions, we\nupdate the historical data underlying\nour VaR model on a weekly basis, or more\nfrequently during periods of market\nstress, and regularly review the\nassumptions underlying the model. A\nminor portion of risks related to our\ntrading positions is not included in\nVaR. These risks are reviewed as part of\nour ICAAP. For more information\nregarding ICAAP, see Capital Management\non page 49.\n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates and\nenhances our VaR model so that it\nreflects the material risks in our\ntrading portfolio. Changes to the VaR\nmodel are reviewed and approved prior to\nimplementation and any material changes\nare reported to management through the\nappropriate management committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk\nmeasures, including VaR, are\nindependently set by Global Markets Risk\nManagement and reviewed on a regular\nbasis so that trading limits remain\nrelevant and within our overall risk\nappetite for market risks. Trading\nlimits are reviewed in the context of\nmarket liquidity, volatility and\nstrategic business priorities. Trading\nlimits are set at both a granular level\nto allow for extensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to\naccount for correlations among risk\nfactors. All trading limits are approved\nat least annually. Approved trading\nlimits are stored and tracked in a\ncentralized limits management system.\nTrading limit excesses are communicated\nto management for review. Certain\nquantitative market risk measures and\ncorresponding limits have been\nidentified as critical in the\nCorporation\u2019s Risk Appetite Statement.\nThese risk appetite limits are reported\non a daily basis and are approved at\nleast annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global\nMarkets senior leadership communicates\ndaily to discuss losses, key risk\npositions and any limit excesses. As a\nresult of this process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 43 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. Covered\npositions are defined by regulatory\nstandards as trading assets and\nliabilities, both on- and off-balance\nsheet, that meet a defined set of\nspecifications. These specifications\nidentify the most liquid trading\npositions which are intended to be held\nfor a short-term horizon and where we\nare able to hedge the material risk\nelements in a two-way market. Positions\nin less liquid markets, or where there\nare restrictions on the ability to trade\nthe positions, typically do not qualify\nas covered positions. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, except for\nstructural foreign currency positions\nthat are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval.\n\nIn addition, Table 43 presents our fair\nvalue option portfolio, which includes\nsubstantially all of the funded and\nunfunded exposures for which we elect\nthe fair value option, and their\ncorresponding hedges. Additionally,\nmarket risk VaR for trading activities\nas presented in Table 43 differs from\nVaR used for regulatory capital\ncalculations due to the holding period\nbeing\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America76                                                               \n                                                                                  \nused. The holding period for VaR used\nfor regulatory capital calculations is\n10 days, while for the market risk VaR\npresented below, it is one day. Both\nmeasures utilize the same process and\nmethodology.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 43 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 43 presents year-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for 2022\nand 2021 using a 99 percent confidence\n\nlevel.

utilizing a one-\nday holding period, against a comparable\nsubset of trading revenue. A backtesting\nexcess occurs when a trading loss\nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding\nday. These excesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and market\nmoves that produced the trading loss\nwith a goal to help confirm that the VaR\nmethodology accurately represents those\nlosses. We expect the frequency of\ntrading losses in excess of VaR to be in\nline with the confidence level of the\nVaR statistic being tested. For example,\nwith a 99 percent confidence level, we\nexpect one trading loss in excess of VaR\nevery 100 days or between two to three\ntrading losses in excess of VaR over the\ncourse of a year. The number of\nbacktesting excesses observed can differ\nfrom the statistically expected number\nof excesses if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially\ndifferent than the level of market\nvolatility that existed during the three\nyears of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting\nis defined by regulatory agencies in\norder to most closely align with the VaR\ncomponent of the regulatory capital\ncalculation. This revenue differs from\ntotal trading-related revenue in that it\nexcludes revenue from trading activities\nthat either do not generate market risk\nor the market risk cannot be included in\nVaR. Some examples of the types of\nrevenue excluded for backtesting are\nfees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income and intra-day trading\nrevenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR\nresults used for regulatory capital\ncalculations as well as the VaR results\nfor key legal entities, regions and risk\nfactors. These results are reported to\nsenior market risk management. Senior\nmanagement regularly reviews and\nevaluates the results of these tests.\n\nDuring 2022, there was one day where\nthis subset of trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our total covered\nportfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day\nholding period.\n                                                                                  \n  Total Trading-related Revenue                                                   \n                                                                                  \nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding\nbrokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding\nvaluation adjustment gains (losses),\nrepresents the total amount earned from\ntrading positions, including market-\nbased net interest income, which are\ntaken in a diverse range of financial\ninstruments and markets. For more\ninformation on fair value, see Note 20 \u2013\nFair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile\nand is largely driven by general market\nconditions and customer demand. Also,\ntrading-related revenue is dependent on\nthe volume and type of transactions, the\nlevel of risk assumed, and the\nvolatility of price and rate movements\nat any given time within the ever-\nchanging market environment. Significant\ndaily revenue by business is monitored\nand the primary drivers of these are\nreviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a graphic\ndepiction of trading volatility and\nillustrates the daily level of trading-\nrelated revenue for 2022 and 2021.\nDuring 2022, positive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for 99 percent of\nthe trading days, of which 90 percent\nwere daily trading gains of over $25\nmillion, and the largest loss was $9\nmillion. This compares to 2021 where\npositive trading-related revenue was\nrecorded for 97 percent of the trading\ndays, of which 80 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25 million, and\nthe largest loss was $45 million.\n                                                                                  \n  Trading Portfolio Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                                  \nBecause the very nature of a VaR model\nsuggests results can exceed our\nestimates and it is dependent on a\nlimited historical window, we also\nstress test our portfolio using scenario\nanalysis. This analysis estimates the\nchange in the value of our trading\nportfolio that may result from abnormal\nmarket movements.\n\nA set of scenarios, categorized as\neither historical or hypothetical, are\ncomputed daily for the overall trading\nportfolio and individual businesses.\nThese scenarios include shocks to\nunderlying market risk factors that may\nbe well beyond the shocks found in the\nhistorical data used to calculate VaR.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during\na period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period\nrepresenting the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical\nscenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from\npotential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in\nresponse to changing positions and new economic or political information. In\naddition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential\nmarket events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are\nreviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress\ntesting and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios\nused for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading\nportfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are\nforecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity\nplanning.

Interest rate risk represents the most\nsignificant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate\nrisk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by\nmovements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending\nand deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast\ntakes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the\nfuture direction of interest rate movements as implied by market-based forward\ncurves. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate\nscenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate\nsensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is\nfrequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on\neconomic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually\nmonitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable\nlevel of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we\nanalyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and\npricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and\ninvestment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest\nrate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely\naffect earnings and capital.

The interest rate scenarios\nalso assume U.S. dollar interest rates\nare floored at zero. Depending on the\nlevel of interest rates, Down-rate\nscenarios may not receive the full\nimpact of the rate shock, particularly\nin low rate environments. The overall\ndecrease in asset sensitivity, as shown\nin the following table, to Up-rate\nscenarios was primarily due to an\nincrease in long-end and short-end\nrates. We continue to be asset sensitive\nto a parallel upward move in interest\nrates with the majority of that impact\ncoming from the short end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher interest\nrates negatively impact the fair value\nof our debt securities classified as\navailable for sale and adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from the\nbanking book activities.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in\nthe baseline forecast and in alternate\ninterest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 46 assumes no change\nin deposit portfolio size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios,\nany customer activity resulting in the\nreplacement of low-cost or noninterest-\nbearing deposits with higher yielding\ndeposits or market-based funding would\nreduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 46.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can\nbe substantial in the mortgage business.\nChanges in interest rates and other\nmarket factors impact the volume of\nmortgage originations. Changes in\n\ninterest rates also impact the value of\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)\nand the related residential first\nmortgage LHFS between the date of the\nIRLC and the date the loans are sold to\nthe secondary market. An increase in\nmortgage interest rates typically leads\nto a decrease in the value of these\ninstruments. Conversely, when there is\nan increase in interest rates, the value\nof the MSRs will increase driven by\nlower prepayment expectations. Because\nthe interest rate risks of these hedged\nitems offset, we combine them into one\noverall hedged item with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio consisting of\nderivative contracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded\ngains of $78 million, $39 million and\n$321 million. For more information on\nMSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Compliance and Operational Risk Management                                     \n                                                                                  \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or\nregulatory sanctions, material financial\nloss or damage to the reputation of the\nCorporation arising from the failure of\nthe Corporation to comply with the\nrequirements of applicable laws, rules,\nregulations and our internal policies\nand procedures (collectively, applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations). We are\nsubject to comprehensive regulation\nunder federal and state laws, rules and\nregulations in the U.S. and the laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which we\noperate, including those related to\nfinancial crimes and anti-money\nlaundering, market conduct, trading\nactivities, fair lending, privacy, data\nprotection and unfair, deceptive or\nabusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\nprocesses or systems, people or external\nevents, and includes legal risk.\nOperational risk may occur anywhere in\nthe Corporation, including third-party\nbusiness processes, and is not limited\nto operations functions. The Corporation\nfaces a number of key operational risks\nincluding third-party risk, model risk,\nconduct risk, technology risk,\ninformation security risk and data risk.\nOperational risk can result in financial\nlosses and reputational impacts and is a\ncomponent in the calculation of total\nRWA used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculation. For more information on\nBasel 3 calculations, see Capital\nManagement on page 49.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and\nforemost responsible for managing all\naspects of their businesses, including\ntheir compliance and operational risk.\nFLUs and control functions are required\nto understand their business processes\nand related risks and controls,\nincluding third-party dependencies and\nthe related regulatory requirements, and\nmonitor and report on the effectiveness\nof the control environment. In order to\nactively monitor and assess the\nperformance of their processes and\ncontrols, they must conduct\ncomprehensive quality assurance\nactivities and identify issues and risks\nto remediate control gaps and\nweaknesses. FLUs and control functions\nmust also adhere to compliance and\noperational risk appetite limits to meet\nstrategic, capital and financial\nplanning objectives. Finally, FLUs and\ncontrol functions are responsible for\nthe proactive identification, management\nand escalation of compliance and\noperational risks across the\nCorporation. Collectively, these efforts\nare important to strengthen their\ncompliance and operational resiliency,\nwhich is the ability to deliver critical\noperations through disruption.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk\nteams independently assess compliance\nand operational risk, monitor business\nactivities and processes and evaluate\nFLUs and control functions for adherence\nto applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, including identifying\nissues and risks, and reporting\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America80                                                               \n                                                                                  \non the state of the control environment.\nCorporate Audit provides an independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key compliance and\noperational risk processes and controls\nacross the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance \u2013\nEnterprise Policy and Operational Risk\nManagement \u2013 Enterprise Policy set the\nrequirements for reporting compliance\nand operational risk information to\nexecutive management as well as the\nBoard or appropriate Board-level\ncommittees and reflect Global Compliance\nand Operational Risk\u2019s responsibilities\nfor conducting independent oversight of\nthe Corporation\u2019s compliance and\noperational risk management activities.\nThe Board provides oversight of\ncompliance risk through its Audit\nCommittee and the ERC, and operational\nrisk through its ERC.\n\nA key operational risk facing the\nCorporation is information security,\nwhich includes cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity risk includes exposure to\nfailures or interruptions of service or\nsecurity breaches resulting from\nmalicious technological attacks that\nimpact the confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of our or third parties'\noperations, systems or data. The\nCorporation seeks to mitigate\ninformation security risk and associated\nreputational and compliance risk by\nemploying a multi-layered and\nintelligence-led Global Information\nSecurity Program focused on preparing\nfor, preventing, detecting, mitigating,\nresponding to and recovering from cyber\nthreats and incidents and effectively\noperating the Corporation\u2019s processes.\nAdditionally, our business continuity\npolicy, standards and procedures are\ndesigned to maintain the availability of\nbusiness functions and enable impacted\nunits within the Corporation and third\nparties to achieve strategic objectives\nin the event of a cybersecurity\nincident.\n\nThe Global Information Security Program\nis supported by three lines of defense.\nThe Global Information Security Team\nwithin the first line of defense is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Global Information\nSecurity Program, which includes\ndefining policies and procedures to\nsafeguard the Corporation\u2019s information\nsystems and data, conducting\nvulnerability and third-party\ninformation security assessments,\ninformation security event management\n(e.g., responding to ransomware and\ndistributed denial of service attacks),\nevaluation of external cyber\nintelligence, supporting industry\ncybersecurity efforts and working with\ngovernmental agencies, and developing\nemployee training to support adherence\nto the Corporation\u2019s policies and\nprocedures. As the second line of\ndefense, Global Compliance and\nOperational Risk independently assesses,\nmonitors and tests information security\nrisk across the Corporation, as well as\nthe effectiveness of the Global\nInformation Security Program. Corporate\nAudit serves as the third line of\ndefense, conducting additional\nindependent review and validation of the\nfirst-line processes and functions. As\npart of our Global Information Security\nProgram, we leverage both internal and\nexternal assessments and partnerships\nwith industry leaders to help approach\ninformation security holistically.\nAdditionally the Corporation maintains a\ncomprehensive enterprise-wide program\nthat defines standards for the planning,\nsourcing, management, and oversight of\nthird-party relationships and third-\nparty access to its system, facilities,\nand/or confidential or proprietary data\nfor a business purpose or supervisory\nfunction.\n\nThrough established governance\nstructures, we have processes to help\nfacilitate appropriate and effective\noversight of information security risk.\nThese routines enable our three lines of\ndefense and management to debate\ninformation security risks and monitor\ncontrol performance to allow for further\nescalation to executive management,\nmanagement and\n\nBoard-level committees or to the Board,\nas appropriate. The Board is actively\nengaged in the oversight of Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s Global Information Security\nProgram and devotes significant time and\nattention to the oversight of\ncybersecurity and information security\nrisk. The Board regularly discusses\ncybersecurity and information security\nrisks with the Chief Technology and\nInformation Officer and the Chief\nInformation Security Officer.\nAdditionally, the ERC receives regular\nreporting, and reviews and approves the\nInformation Security Program and Policy\non an annual basis.\n                                                                                  \n   Reputational Risk Management                                                   \n                                                                                  \nReputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations. Reputational risk may result\nfrom many of the Corporation\u2019s\nactivities, including those related to\nthe management of our strategic,\noperational, compliance and credit\nrisks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational\nrisk through established policies and\ncontrols embedded throughout its\nbusiness and risk management processes.\nWe proactively monitor and identify\npotential reputational risk events and\nhave processes established to mitigate\nreputational risks in a timely manner.\nIf reputational risk events occur, we\nfocus on remediating the underlying\nissue and taking action to minimize\ndamage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Corporation has processes and\nprocedures in place to respond to events\nthat give rise to reputational risk,\nincluding educating individuals and\norganizations that influence public\nopinion, implementing external\ncommunication strategies to mitigate the\nrisk, and informing key stakeholders of\npotential reputational risks. The\nCorporation\u2019s organization and\ngovernance structure provides oversight\nof reputational risks. Reputational risk\nreporting is provided regularly and\ndirectly to senior management and the\nERC, which provides primary oversight of\nreputational risk. In addition, each FLU\nhas a committee, which includes\nrepresentatives from Legal and Risk,\nthat is responsible for the oversight of\nreputational risk, including approval\nfor business activities that present\nelevated levels of reputational risks.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the physical impacts of climate\nchange, driven by extreme weather events\nsuch as hurricanes and floods, as well\nas chronic longer-term shifts such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea levels, and (2) risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\nThese changes and events may have broad\nimpacts on operations, supply chains,\ndistribution networks, customers and\nmarkets and are otherwise referred to,\nrespectively, as physical risk and\ntransition risk. These risks may impact\nboth financial and nonfinancial risk\ntypes. Physical risk may lead to\nincreased credit risk by diminishing\nborrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or\nimpacting the value of collateral.\nPhysical risk may also increase\noperational risk by impacting the\nCorporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\ncustomers or vendors. Transition risks\nmay amplify credit risk through the\nfinancial impacts of changes in policy,\ntechnology or the market on the\nCorporation or its counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk. In addition,\nreputational risk may arise, including\nfrom our climate-related practices and\ndisclosures and if we do not meet our\nclimate-related commitments.\n\nEffective management of climate risk\nrequires coordinated governance, clearly\ndefined roles and responsibilities and\nwell-\n                                                                                  \n  81Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndeveloped processes to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and control risks. As\nclimate risk spans all key risk types,\nwe have developed and continue to\nenhance processes to embed climate risk\nconsiderations into our Risk Framework\nand risk management programs established\nfor strategic, credit, market,\nliquidity, compliance, operational and\nreputational risks. Our Environmental\nand Social Risk Policy Framework aligns\nwith our Risk Framework and provides\nadditional clarity and transparency\nregarding our approach to environmental\nand social risks, inclusive of climate\nrisk.\n\nOur governance framework establishes\noversight of climate risk practices and\nstrategies by the Board, supported by\nits ERC, as well as the MRC and the\nResponsible Growth Committee, both of\nwhich are management-level committees\ncomprised of senior leaders across every\nmajor FLU and control function. The\nResponsible Growth Committee is\nsupported by the ESG Disclosure sub-\ncommittee, which is responsible for\nreviewing and providing oversight of the\nCorporation\u2019s climate and ESG-related\npublic disclosures.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by an executive officer who\nreports to the CRO. The Climate Risk\nCouncil, which consists of leaders\nacross risk, FLU and control functions,\nmeets routinely to discuss our approach\nto managing climate-related risks in\nline with our Risk Framework.\n\nIn 2021, we publicly announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero emissions\nin our financing activities, operations,\nand supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal) and set 2030 emissions targets for\nour operations and supply chain. In\nconnection with our Net Zero Goal, in\n2022, we announced a target to reduce\nemissions by 2030 associated with our\nfinancing activities related to auto\nmanufacturing, energy and power\ngeneration (2030 Targets). In our\nSeptember 2022 Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures Report, we\ndisclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed\nemissions and emissions intensity\nmetrics for these sectors, with 2019\nserving as the baseline for our 2030\nTargets.\n\nWe plan to disclose the financed\nemissions for additional portions of our\nbusiness loan portfolio in 2023, and we\nplan to set financing activity emission\nreduction targets for other key sectors\nby April 2024.\n\nAchieving our climate--related goals and\ntargets, including our Net Zero Goal and\n2030 Targets, may require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, new standards and\npublic policies, including those that\nimprove the cost of capital for the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well\nas ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith customers, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.\n\nGiven the extended period of these and\nother climate-related goals we have\nestablished, our initiatives have not\nresulted in a significant effect on our\nresults of operations or financial\nposition in the relevant periods\npresented herein.\n\nFor more information about climate-\nrelated matters, including how the\nCorporation manages climate risk, and\nthe Corporation\u2019s climate-related goals\nand commitments, including our plans to\nachieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030\nTargets and progress on our sustainable\nfinance goals, see the Corporation\u2019s\nwebsite, including our 2022 Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nReport and the 2022\n\nAnnual Report to shareholders available\non the Investor Relations portion of our\nwebsite in March 2023.

Risk Factors on page 8.\n\nThe foregoing discussion and our\ndiscussion in the 2022 Annual Report to\nshareholders regarding our goals and\ncommitments with respect to climate risk\nmanagement, including environmental\ntransition considerations, include\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These\nstatements are not guarantees of future\nresults or performance and involve\ncertain known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions that are\ndifficult to predict and are often\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control. Actual\noutcomes and results may differ\nmaterially from those expressed in, or\nimplied by, any of these forward-looking\nstatements.\n                                                                                  \n  Complex Accounting Estimates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nOur significant accounting principles,\nas described in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, are\nessential in understanding the MD&A.\nMany of our significant accounting\nprinciples require complex judgments to\nestimate the values of assets and\nliabilities. We have procedures and\nprocesses in place to facilitate making\nthese judgments.\n\nThe more judgmental estimates are\nsummarized in the following discussion.\nWe have identified and described the\ndevelopment of the variables most\nimportant in the estimation processes\nthat involve mathematical models to\nderive the estimates. In many cases,\nthere are numerous alternative judgments\nthat could be used in the process of\ndetermining the inputs to the models.\nWhere alternatives exist, we have used\nthe factors that we believe represent\nthe most reasonable value in developing\nthe inputs. Actual performance that\ndiffers from our estimates of the key\nvariables could materially impact our\nresults of operations. Separate from the\npossible future impact to our results of\noperations from input and model\nvariables, the value of our lending\nportfolio and market-sensitive assets\nand liabilities may change subsequent to\nthe balance sheet date, often\nsignificantly, due to the nature and\nmagnitude of future credit and market\nconditions. Such credit and market\nconditions may change quickly and in\nunforeseen ways and the resulting\nvolatility could have a significant,\nnegative effect on future operating\nresults. These fluctuations would not be\nindicative of deficiencies in our models\nor inputs.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses includes\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nand the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Our process for determining\nthe allowance for credit losses is\ndiscussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe determination of the allowance for\ncredit losses is based on numerous\nestimates and assumptions, which require\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \na high degree of judgment and are often\ninterrelated. A critical judgment in the\nprocess is the weighting of our forward-\nlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are\nincorporated into our quantitative\nmodels. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation\nuses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in\nits ECL calculation, which have included\na baseline scenario derived from\nconsensus estimates, an adverse scenario\nreflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall economic outlook is weighted\n95 percent towards a recessionary\nenvironment in 2023, with continued\ninflationary pressures leading to lower\ngross domestic product (GDP) and higher\nunemployment rate expectations as\ncompared to the prior year. Generally,\nas the consensus estimates improve or\ndeteriorate, the allowance for credit\nlosses will change in a similar\ndirection. There are multiple variables\nthat drive the macroeconomic scenarios\nwith the key variables including, but\nnot limited to, U.S. GDP and\nunemployment rates. As of December 31,\n2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook\nfor the U.S. average unemployment rate\nwas forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7\npercent and 4.3 percent in the fourth\nquarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively, and the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was\nforecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9\npercent and 1.9 percent year-over-year\nin the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and\n2024, respectively. As of December 31,\n2022, the latest consensus estimates for\nthe U.S. average unemployment rate for\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7\npercent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to\ngrow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the\nfourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a\ntighter labor market and depressed\ngrowth expectations compared to our\nmacroeconomic outlook as of December 31,\n2021, and were factored into our\nallowance for credit losses estimate as\nof December 31, 2022. In addition, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nat 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the\nfourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, and\nthe weighted macroeconomic outlook for\nU.S. GDP was forecasted to contract 0.4\npercent and grow 1.2 percent year-over-\nyear in the fourth quarters of 2023 and\n2024.\n\nIn addition to the above judgments and\nestimates, the allowance for credit\nlosses can also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset quality\nof the portfolio, such as increases or\ndecreases in credit and/or internal risk\nratings in our commercial portfolio,\nimprovement or deterioration in borrower\ndelinquencies or credit scores in our\ncredit card portfolio and increases or\ndecreases in home prices, which is a\nprimary driver of LTVs, in our consumer\nreal estate portfolio, all of which have\nsome degree of uncertainty. The\nallowance for credit losses increased to\n$14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to loan\ngrowth and a dampened macroeconomic\noutlook in 2022.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the\nsensitivity of the macroeconomic\nscenarios and other assumptions on the\nestimate of our allowance for credit\nlosses, the Corporation compared the\nDecember 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the\nbaseline scenario and our adverse\nscenario. Relative to the baseline\nscenario, the adverse scenario assumed a\npeak U.S. unemployment rate of nearly\nthree percentage points higher than the\nbaseline scenario, a decline in U.S. GDP\nfollowed by a prolonged recovery and a\nlower home price outlook with a\ndifference of approximately eight\npercent at the trough. This\n\nsensitivity analysis resulted in a\nhypothetical increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses of approximately $4\nbillion.\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be\nuseful to understand how changes in\nmacroeconomic assumptions could impact\nour modeled ECLs, it is not meant to\nforecast how our allowance for credit\nlosses is expected to change in a\ndifferent macroeconomic outlook.\nImportantly, the analysis does not\nincorporate a variety of factors,\nincluding qualitative reserves and the\nweighting of alternate scenarios, which\ncould have offsetting effects on the\nestimate. Considering the variety of\nfactors contemplated when developing and\nweighting macroeconomic outlooks such as\nrecent economic events, leading economic\nindicators, views of internal and third-\nparty economists and industry trends, in\naddition to other qualitative factors,\nthe Corporation believes the allowance\nfor credit losses at December 31, 2022\nis appropriate.\n                                                                                  \n   Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                            \n                                                                                  \nUnder applicable accounting standards,\nwe are required to maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use\nof unobservable inputs in measuring fair\nvalue. We classify fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments\nand MSRs based on the three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy in the accounting\nstandards.\n\nThe fair values of assets and\nliabilities may include adjustments,\nsuch as market liquidity and credit\nquality, where appropriate. Valuations\nof products using models or other\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions\nused for the significant inputs. Where\nmarket data is available, the inputs\nused for valuation reflect that\ninformation as of our valuation date.\nInputs to valuation models are\nconsidered unobservable if they are\nsupported by little or no market\nactivity. In periods of extreme\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in\nilliquid markets, there may be more\nvariability in market pricing or a lack\nof market data to use in the valuation\nprocess. In keeping with the prudent\napplication of estimates and management\njudgment in determining the fair value\nof assets and liabilities, we have in\nplace various processes and controls\nthat include: a model validation policy\nthat requires review and approval of\nquantitative models used for deal\npricing, financial statement fair value\ndetermination and risk quantification; a\ntrading product valuation policy that\nrequires verification of all traded\nproduct valuations; and a periodic\nreview and substantiation of daily\nprofit and loss reporting for all traded\nproducts. Primarily through validation\ncontrols, we utilize both broker and\npricing service inputs which can and do\ninclude both market-observable and\ninternally-modeled values and/or\nvaluation inputs. Our reliance on this\ninformation is affected by our\nunderstanding of how the broker and/or\npricing service develops its data with a\nhigher degree of reliance applied to\nthose that are more directly observable\nand lesser reliance applied to those\ndeveloped through their own internal\nmodeling. For example, broker quotes in\nless active markets may only be\nindicative and therefore less reliable.\nThese processes and controls are\nperformed independently of the business.\nFor more information, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements and Note 21 \u2013 Fair\nValue Option to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities                                                  \n                                                                                  \nFinancial assets and liabilities, and\nMSRs, where values are based on\nvaluation techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement are classified as Level 3\nunder the fair value hierarchy\nestablished in applicable accounting\nstandards. The fair value of these Level\n3 financial assets and liabilities and\n                                                                                  \n  83Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nMSRs is determined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be\nhedged with derivatives classified as\nLevel 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses\nassociated with Level 3 financial\ninstruments may be offset by gains or\nlosses associated with financial\ninstruments classified in other levels\nof the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3\ngains and losses recorded in earnings\ndid not have a significant impact on our\nliquidity or capital.

For more information on\ntransfers into and out of Level 3 during\n2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair\nValue Measurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets                                    \n                                                                                  \nAccrued income taxes, reported as a\ncomponent of either other assets or\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nrepresent the net amount of current\nincome taxes we expect to pay to or\nreceive from various taxing\njurisdictions attributable to our\noperations to date. We currently file\nincome tax returns in more than 100\njurisdictions and consider many factors,\nincluding statutory, judicial and\nregulatory guidance, in estimating the\nappropriate accrued income taxes for\neach jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a\ncomponent of other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent\nthe net decrease in taxes expected to be\npaid in the future because of net\noperating loss (NOL) and tax credit\ncarryforwards and\n\nbecause of future reversals of temporary\ndifferences in the bases of assets and\nliabilities as measured by tax laws and\ntheir bases as reported in the financial\nstatements. NOL and tax credit\ncarryforwards result in reductions to\nfuture tax liabilities, and many of\nthese attributes can expire if not\nutilized within certain periods. We\nconsider the need for valuation\nallowances to reduce net deferred tax\nassets to the amounts that we estimate\nare more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent with the applicable\naccounting guidance, we monitor relevant\ntax authorities and change our estimates\nof accrued income taxes and/or net\ndeferred tax assets due to changes in\nincome tax laws and their interpretation\nby the courts and regulatory\nauthorities. These revisions of our\nestimates, which also may result from\nour income tax planning and from the\nresolution of income tax audit matters,\nmay be material to our operating results\nfor any given period.\n\nSee Note 19 \u2013 Income Taxes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a\ntable of significant tax attributes and\nadditional information.

The\nCorporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the\nCorporation; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the\nCorporation are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the\nCorporation; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Corporation\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements.

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and on the Corporation's\ninternal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect\nto the Corporation in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence\n\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such\nother procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n                                                                                  \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and\nthat (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses -\nCommercial and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,\nexcluding loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nvalue option. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nwas $12.7 billion on total loans and\nleases of $1,040.0 billion, which\nexcludes loans accounted for under the\nfair value option. For commercial and\nconsumer card loans, the expected credit\nloss is typically estimated using\nquantitative methods that consider a\nvariety of factors such as historical\nloss experience, the current credit\nquality of the portfolio as well as an\neconomic outlook over the life of the\nloan. In its loss forecasting framework,\nthe Corporation incorporates forward\nlooking information through the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the\nforecasted life of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include\nvariables that have historically been\nkey drivers of increases and decreases\nin credit losses. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices,\ngross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen and the weighting given\nto each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic\nevents, leading economic indicators,\nviews of internal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends. Also\nincluded in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses are qualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are expected but, in\nthe Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions.\nFactors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal\nand regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation\nconsiders the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built on\nhistorical data.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and\nlease losses for the commercial and\nconsumer card portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndeveloping lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios, related weightings to each\nscenario and certain qualitative\nreserves, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and\nin evaluating audit evidence obtained,\nand (ii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding controls over the evaluation\nand approval of models, forecast\nscenarios and related weightings, and\nqualitative reserves. These procedures\nalso included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the\nallowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the loss forecast\nmodels and methodology, (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of certain\nmacroeconomic variables, (iii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s development, selection and\nweighting of lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios used in the loss forecast\nmodels, (iv) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the\nestimate, and (v) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves made to the model output\nresults to determine the overall\nallowance for loan\n\nand lease losses. The procedures also\nincluded the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in evaluating the\nappropriateness of certain loss forecast\nmodels, the reasonableness of economic\nforecast scenarios and related\nweightings and the reasonableness of\ncertain qualitative reserves.\n\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial\nInstruments\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nCorporation carries certain financial\ninstruments at fair value, which\nincludes $10.7 billion of assets and\n$7.1 billion of liabilities classified\nas Level 3 fair value measurements that\nare valued on a recurring basis and $3.4\nbillion of assets classified as Level 3\nfair value measurements that are valued\non a nonrecurring basis, for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation. The Corporation determines\nthe fair value of Level 3 financial\ninstruments using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. Unobservable inputs, such\nas volatility or implied yield, may be\ndetermined using quantitative-based\nextrapolations, pricing models or other\ninternal methodologies which incorporate\nmanagement estimates and available\nmarket information.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the valuation of certain\nLevel 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment and estimation used\nby management to determine the fair\nvalue of these financial instruments,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and\neffort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained,\nincluding the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe valuation of financial instruments,\nincluding controls related to valuation\nmodels, significant unobservable inputs,\nand data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a\nsample of these certain financial\ninstruments and comparison of\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair\nvalue. Developing the independent\nestimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data\nprovided by management and evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Corporation\u2019s\nauditor since 1958.\n

Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current\nperiod presentation. New Accounting\nStandards Hedge Accounting The FASB\nissued a new accounting standard that\nmakes targeted improvements to the\napplication of the fair value hedge\naccounting guidance for closed\nportfolios of financial assets. The\ntargeted improvements were effective\nJanuary 1, 2023 on a prospective basis.\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\nThe FASB amended the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for expected\ncredit losses (ECL) by removing the\nrecognition and measurement guidance on\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and\nadding disclosures on the financial\neffect and subsequent performance of\ncertain types of modifications made to\nborrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. The effects of these\nchanges on the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated financial position, results\nof operations or disclosures in the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements are not significant. The\namendments were effective on January 1,\n2023, which the Corporation adopted\nusing a modified retrospective approach.\n\nSignificant Accounting Principles Cash\nand Cash Equivalents Cash and cash\nequivalents include cash on hand, cash\nitems in the process of collection, cash\nsegregated under federal and other\nbrokerage regulations, and amounts due\nfrom correspondent banks, the Federal\nReserve Bank and certain non-U.S.\ncentral banks. Certain cash balances are\nrestricted as to withdrawal or usage by\nlegally binding contractual agreements\nor regulatory requirements. Securities\nFinancing Agreements Securities borrowed\nor purchased under agreements to resell\nand securities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase (securities\nfinancing agreements) are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions\nexcept in instances where the\ntransaction is required to be accounted\nfor as individual sale and purchase\ntransactions. Generally, these\nagreements are recorded at acquisition\nor sale price plus accrued interest. In\ninstances where the interest is\nnegative, the Corporation\u2019s policy is to\npresent negative interest on financial\nassets as interest income and negative\ninterest on financial liabilities as\ninterest expense. For securities\nfinancing agreements that are accounted\nfor under the fair value option, the\nchanges in the fair value of these\nsecurities financing agreements are\nrecorded in market making and similar\nactivities in the Consolidated Statement\nof Income. The Corporation\u2019s policy is\nto monitor the market value of the\nprincipal amount loaned under resale\nagreements and obtain collateral from or\nreturn collateral pledged to\ncounterparties when appropriate.\nSecurities financing agreements do not\ncreate material credit risk due to these\ncollateral provisions; therefore, an\nallowance for loan losses is not\nnecessary. In transactions where the\nCorporation acts as the lender in a\nsecurities lending agreement and\nreceives securities that can be pledged\nor sold as collateral, it recognizes an\nasset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nat fair value, representing the\nsecurities received, and a liability,\nrepresenting the obligation to return\nthose securities. Trading Instruments\nFinancial instruments utilized in\ntrading activities are carried at fair\nvalue. Fair value is generally based on\nquoted market prices for the same or\nsimilar assets and liabilities. If these\nmarket prices are not available, fair\nvalues are estimated based on dealer\nquotes, pricing models, discounted cash\nflow methodologies, or similar\ntechniques where the determination of\nfair value may require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation.\nRealized gains and losses are recorded\non a trade-date basis. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses are\nrecognized in market making and similar\nactivities. Derivatives and Hedging\nActivities Derivatives are entered into\non behalf of customers, for trading or\nto support risk management activities.\nDerivatives used in risk management\nactivities include derivatives that are\nboth designated in qualifying accounting\nhedge relationships and derivatives used\nto hedge market risks in relationships\nthat are not designated in qualifying\naccounting hedge relationships (referred\nto as other risk management activities).\nThe Corporation manages interest rate\nand foreign currency exchange rate\nsensitivity predominantly through the\nuse of derivatives. Derivatives utilized\nby the Corporation include swaps,\nfutures and forward settlement\ncontracts, and option contracts.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America94                                                               \n                                                                                  \nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value,\ntaking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting\nagreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions\nand offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For\nexchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active\nor inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters,\nsimilar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair\nvalue may require significant management judgment or estimation. Valuations of\nderivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including\ncounterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation\u2019s\nown credit standing. Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or\nderivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair\nvalue included in market making and similar activities. Derivatives used for other\nrisk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative\nliabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been\ndesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not\nqualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported\nat fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative\ninstrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will\noffset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks\nassociated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by\nthe Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk\nare included in market making and similar activities. Credit derivatives are also\nused by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit\nexposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in\nmarket making and similar activities and other income. Derivatives Used For Hedge\nAccounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation\nformally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and\nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for\nundertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily\nuses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period\nthereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge\ntransaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes\nin the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The\nCorporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative\nis not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then\nreflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of\nthe hedge relationship. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in\nthe fair value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that are attributable\nto interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and\nin the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the\nrelated hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is\nterminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the\ncarrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in\nthe same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or\nliability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such\nadjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective\nasset or liability. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the\nvariability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions\ncaused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Corporation\nalso uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred\ncompensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges\nare recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified\ninto the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in\nthe same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that\nare excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income\nstatement line item as the hedged item. Net investment hedges are used to manage\nthe foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign\noperation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net\ninvestment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated\nOCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge\neffectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities. Securities\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade\ndate. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities\nwere acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation\u2019s trading\nactivities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized\ngains and losses included in market making and similar activities. Substantially\nall other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation\u2019s asset and\nliability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM)\ndebt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-\nsale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in\naccumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported\nin market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities\nthat management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at\namortized cost. The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has\ndeclined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is\nwritten down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the\nCorporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for\nECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S.\ngovernment agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the\nCorporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt\nsecurities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and\nexternal credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt\nsecurity fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis\nis used by the Corporation to\n                                                                                  \n  95Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndetermine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL. The\nCorporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit\nloss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt\nsecurities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses.\nCash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information\navailable such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying\ncollateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that\namount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may\nexceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is\nlimited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the\nasset. The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit\nlosses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the\nremaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to\nestimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are\namortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the\ncontractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of\ndebt securities are determined using the specific identification method. Equity\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading\npurposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in\nother income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values\nare recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable\nprice changes. These securities are reported in other assets. Loans and Leases\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are\nmeasured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances\nnet of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on\noriginated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or\ndiscounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred\nand recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related\nloans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income\nusing a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain\nconsumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported\nin interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar\nactivities or other income. Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting\npurposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and,\nwithin each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable. A portfolio\nsegment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class\nof financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio\nsegments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and\nmethods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2019s threeportfolio segments are Consumer\nReal Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within\nthe Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home\nequity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nare credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within\nthe Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial,\ncommercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business\ncommercial. Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers\nthrough a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type\nleases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the\nestimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is\naccreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate\nthe interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease\ncomponents. Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020, the Corporation\nadopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance\nfor credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and\nthe reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management\u2019s best\nestimate of the ECL in the Corporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans\nand unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Upon\nadoption, a $ 3.3billion, or 32percent, increase in the allowance for credit\nlosses was recorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $\n2.9billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $ 310million increase\nin the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The ECL on funded consumer and\ncommercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\nbinding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to\nthe loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance\nfor credit losses to the current estimate of ECL. For loans and leases, the ECL is\ntypically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as\nwell as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for\nclosed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted\nfor any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension\noptions that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products\n(e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term\nassociated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation\ndoes not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic\nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases\nand decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America96                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including\nrecent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-\nparty economists and industry trends. The estimate of credit losses includes\nexpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance).\nIf a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not\nlimited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be\nassumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is measured based on the present\nvalue of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at\nthe loan\u2019s original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is\nprobable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan\u2019s collateral value or\nits observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the\nrenegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of\nprojected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual\ninterest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to\nrestructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as\ndiscussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the\nallowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired\nloans are evaluated as a pool. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the\nCorporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the\nCorporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business\nconditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the\nvolume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others.\nFurther, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models\nthat are built on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit\ncard portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable\nin the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally\nclassifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90days past due and reverses\ninterest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the\ninterest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was\noriginally recorded. The Corporation has identified the following threeportfolio\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\nConsumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential\nreal estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over\nthe life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments,\nusing quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most\nsignificant in estimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are\nfurther broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current,\ndelinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\nCorporation\u2019s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect\nthe economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real\nestate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss\nestimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and\nlong-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records\na reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn\nportion of the Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation\nif certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending\ncommitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and\nincorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For loans that are more\nthan 180days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the\nallowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the\nreporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing these\nloans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that\nestimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of\ncomparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical\nArea in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value\nis not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods\nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price\nopinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent\nimprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are\nrepresentative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For loans that are more than\n180days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the\nCorporation\u2019s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in\nexcess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is\ncharged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to\nthe initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;\nhowever, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a\nlevel above the cumulative charge-off amount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount\nand timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,\nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable\nbalance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending\nbehavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the\neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in\naccordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act\nof 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then\nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it\nis brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook,\nborrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all\nkey inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. Future draws on\nthe credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally\ncancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined\nusing quantitative methods supplemented with\n                                                                                  \n  97Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nqualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to\nkey borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit\nscore, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The\nECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses\nover the loan\u2019s contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the\ncontractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering\nexpected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of\ncredit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw\nand payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans\ncollateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is\nthe primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and\ncustomer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service\ncoverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and\nregion. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and\nforecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent\nlevels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial\nloans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of\ntransition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life\nof the asset based on the borrower\u2019s current credit risk rating, industry sector,\nsize of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined\nbased on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure,\nthe borrower\u2019s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market.\nAssumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the\nmodel considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic\nproduct, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity\nmarket returns. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the\nCorporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as\nletters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding\nloan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option.\nReserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and\nmethodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded\nlending commitments. Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been\nplaced on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and\nLHFS are not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed\nuncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. If the\ncharged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is reversed through the\nallowance for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of\nrecoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than\ncharge-offs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount. In accordance with\nthe Corporation\u2019s policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including\nresidential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and classified as nonperforming at 90days past due unless repayment of the\nloan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby\nagreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured\nportfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not\nplaced on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming.\nJunior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past due\neven if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-\nsecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell\nis charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes\n180days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy,\nwithin 60days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance\nclassified as nonperforming. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans are\ncha rged off when the loan becomes 180days past due, within 60days after receipt\nof notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confir mation of fraud. These loans\ncontinue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not\nreported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus when they become 90days past due, within 60days after receipt of\nnotification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans are\ncharged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120days past due,\nupon repossession of the collateral, within 60days after receipt of notification\nof bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud. If repossession of the\ncollateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off. Commercial loans and\nleases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90days or more as to\nprincipal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection,\nincluding loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured\nand in the process of collection. Business card loans are charged off in the same\nmanner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are\ngenerally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined\nto be uncollectible. The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or\nlease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the\nspecified due date on the customer\u2019s billing statement. Interest and fees continue\nto accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when\nloans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on\nnonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is\nuncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are\ncredited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual\nstatus when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the\nremaining contractual principal and interest is expected. Troubled Debt\nRestructurings Consumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms\nhave been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could\ninclude a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the\nloan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions\ndesigned to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS\nare not classified as TDRs. Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been\nmodified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on\naccrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and\npayment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America98                                                               \n                                                                                  \nplaced on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-\ninsured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance\nfor a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform\nin accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and reported as nonperforming TDRs. Secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower\nare classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on\nnonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to\nsell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually\ncurrent, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash\nbasis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure\nhas been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured\nconsumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual\nstatus until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later\nthan the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due or, for loans\nthat have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120days past due. A loan that had\npreviously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current\nunderwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted\nfor as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR. Loans Held-for-sale Loans\nthat the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including\nresidential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real\nestate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain\nLHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan\norigination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are\ncapitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a\nloan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that\nare on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the\npolicy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\nPremises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated\nlives range up to 40years for buildings, up to 12years for furniture and\nequipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold\nimprovements . Other Assets For the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and\nleases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets\nfor ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral\nmaintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily\nmargining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be\nmaintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be\nzero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses,\nincluding consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to\nestimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded\nas a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. Lessee\nArrangements Substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s lessee arrangements are\noperating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are\nreported in other assetson the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease\nliabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are\nrecorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less\nthan 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded\nin occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The\nCorporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and\nequipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and\nnon-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized\nbased on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using\nthe Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal\nthe lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease\ncommencement and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill\nis the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual\nbasis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the\nreporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a\nbusiness segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit\nagainst its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated\nequity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity\nin the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses\nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors\ninclude, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other\nrelevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If the Corporation\nconcludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The\nCorporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\nany reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the\nqualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When performing the quantitative\nassessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,\ngoodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss\nwould be recognized for the amount by\n                                                                                  \n  99Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nwhich the reporting unit\u2019s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment\nloss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.\nAn impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent\nreversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable\naccounting guidance. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment\nloss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not\nrecoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is\nconsidered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows\nexpected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have\nindefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is\nrecognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life\nexceeds its fair value. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks\nequity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial\ninterest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation\nconsolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and an obligation to\nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its\ninvolvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing\ndocuments and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the\nVIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such\nreassessments. The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization\nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into\na trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held\nin a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity\nloans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the\nmost significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have\nthe power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage\nagency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds\nsubstantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to\nliquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a\ncommercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer\nor by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain\ncontrolling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust\nif it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds\nsecurities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than\nstandard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to\nthe trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS\nsecurities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation\nconsolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the\nongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust\u2019s liabilities\nor, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the\ntrust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the\nstructure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity\nor other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The\nCorporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one\nor a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design\nof the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through\nliquidation or other substantive rights. Other VIEs used by the Corporation\ninclude collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on\nbehalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not\nroutinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically\nhave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the\nCorporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires\nthe power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO. The\nCorporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control\nover the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and\nalso absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the\nvehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not\nconsolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial\ndesign of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation\ndoes not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the\nvehicle. Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair\nvalue. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by\nunconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as\ntrading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities,\nare based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.\nGenerally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available;\ntherefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the\nassociated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The Corporation measures the\nfair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with\naccounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.\nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under\napplicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one\nof three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest\npriority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest\npriority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy. Level 1\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative\ncontracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S.\nTreasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or\nother inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data\nfor substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and\nliabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less\nfrequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair\nvalue is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the\nmarket or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market\ndata. This category generally includes U.S. government and\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America100                                                              \n                                                                                  \nagency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt\nsecurities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS. Level 3 Unobservable\ninputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant\nto the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and\nliabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair\nvalue requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for\nsuch assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the\nassumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This\ncategory generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations,\nconsumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative\ncontracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent\npricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying\nassets. Income Taxes There are two components of income tax expense: current and\ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax\nassets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and\nliabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the\nfuture because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets\nand liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the\nfinancial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes\nsuch as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation\nallowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management\nconcludes are more likely than not to be realized. Income tax benefits are\nrecognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be\nmore likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order\nto be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount\nof that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The\ndifference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax\nreturn is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records\nincome tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax\nexpense. Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue\nrecognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities. Card\nIncome Card income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as\ninterchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit\ncard transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income\nis presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement\nof the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on\na percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the\ncorresponding payment network\u2019s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized\nat the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees,\nwhich are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants\nthat are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner\npayments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the\ncardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash,\ntravel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past\nredemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other\nhistorical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed.\nThe Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are\nbased on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder\ntransactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements,\nthe credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the\ncredit card partner\u2019s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation. Service\nCharges Service charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related\nfees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are\ngenerally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed.\nConsumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and\nvarious transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer\nactivities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft\ntransactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation\u2019s Global\nTransaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury\nmanagement services, including account maintenance and other services, such as\npayroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees\ngenerally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments,\nfinancial guarantees and SBLCs. Investment and Brokerage Services Investment and\nbrokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset\nmanagement fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory\nagreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\u2019s financial advisors\n(collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees\nare earned as a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and generally range from 50basis\npoints (bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain\na client\u2019s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded\nnet and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent\nfor those services. Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based\nservices that are performed as part of investment management services and are\nbased on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction\namount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that\nare primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are\nearned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage\nfees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various\nfinancial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears\ntransactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker.\nCertain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant\nregulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are\nrecorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is\nan agent for those services. Investment Banking Income Investment banking income\nincludes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting\nconsists of fees\n                                                                                  \n  101Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nearned for the placement of a customer\u2019s\ndebt or equity securities. The revenue\nis generally earned based on a\npercentage of the fixed number of shares\nor principal placed. Once the number of\nshares or notes is determined and the\nservice is completed, the underwriting\nfees are recognized. The Corporation\nincurs certain out-of-pocket expenses,\nsuch as legal costs, in performing these\nservices. These expenses are recovered\nthrough the revenue the Corporation\nearns from the customer and are included\nin operating expenses. Syndication fees\nrepresent fees earned as the agent or\nlead lender responsible for structuring,\narranging and administering a loan\nsyndication. Financial advisory services\nconsist of fees earned for assisting\nclients with transactions related to\nmergers and acquisitions and financial\nrestructurings. Revenue varies depending\non the size of the transaction and scope\nof services performed and is generally\ncontingent on successful completion of\nthe transaction. Revenue is typically\nrecognized once the transaction is\ncompleted and all services have been\nrendered. Additionally, the Corporation\nmay earn a fixed fee in merger and\nacquisition transactions to provide a\nfairness opinion, with the fees\nrecognized when the opinion is delivered\nto the client. Other Revenue Measurement\nand Recognition Policies The Corporation\ndid not disclose the value of any open\nperformance obligations at December 31,\n2022, as its contracts with customers\ngenerally have a fixed term that is less\nthan one year, an open term with a\ncancellation period that is less than\none year, or provisions that allow the\nCorporation to recognize revenue at the\namount it has the right to invoice.\nEarnings Per Common Share Earnings per\ncommon share (EPS) is computed by\ndividing net income allocated to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding, excluding\nunvested\n\ncommon shares subject to repurchase or\ncancellation. Net income allocated to\ncommon shareholders is net income\nadjusted for preferred stock dividends\nincluding dividends declared, accretion\nof discounts on preferred stock\nincluding accelerated accretion when\npreferred stock is repaid early, and\ncumulative dividends related to the\ncurrent dividend period that have not\nbeen declared as of period end, less\nincome allocated to participating\nsecurities. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing income allocated to common\nshareholders plus dividends on dilutive\nconvertible preferred stock and\npreferred stock that can be tendered to\nexercise warrants, by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding plus\namounts representing the dilutive effect\nof stock options outstanding, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units (RSUs),\noutstanding warrants and the dilution\nresulting from the conversion of\nconvertible preferred stock, if\napplicable. Foreign Currency Translation\nAssets, liabilities and operations of\nforeign branches and subsidiaries are\nrecorded based on the functional\ncurrency of each entity. When the\nfunctional currency of a foreign\noperation is the local currency, the\nassets, liabilities and operations are\ntranslated, for consolidation purposes,\nfrom the local currency to the U.S.\ndollar reporting currency at period-end\nrates for assets and liabilities and\ngenerally at average rates for results\nof operations. The resulting unrealized\ngains and losses are reported as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI, net-of-\ntax. When the foreign entity\u2019s\nfunctional currency is the U.S. dollar,\nthe resulting remeasurement gains or\nlosses on foreign currency-denominated\nassets or liabilities are included in\nearnings.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America102                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                               \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

into International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar\nagreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative counterparties.\nWhere legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation\noffsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nfollowing table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by\nprimary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on\nwhich these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis,\nprior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross\nderivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which\ninclude reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received\nor paid.

Over-the-counter cleared derivatives\ninclude bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where\nthe transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Exchange-traded derivatives\ninclude listed options transacted on an exchange.\n\n(2) Consists of derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where the\nenforceability of these agreements is uncertain under bankruptcy laws in some\ncountries or industries.\n\n(3) Amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and,\naccordingly, do not include excess collateral received/pledged. Financial\ninstruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash\nsecurities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative\nassets and liabilities.\nALM and Risk Management Derivatives The Corporation\u2019s ALM and risk management\nactivities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation\nincluding derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and\nderivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign\nexchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's\nALM and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest\nrate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate\ncontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis\nswaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in\nearnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage\ninterest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest\nrate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or\ndepreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are\nlinked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to\nsubstantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk,\nincluding interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market\nrisk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or\nrevenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking\nproduction income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and\nother derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt\nsecurities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate\noptions, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures\nto hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will\nincrease or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest\nrates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit\nrisk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives\ninclude credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives Designated as\nAccounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its\nassets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange\nrates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to\nprotect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America106                                                              \n                                                                                  \nand other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its\nnet investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-\ncurrency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency- denominated debt (net\ninvestment hedges).

These net losses\nreclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income\nrelated to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum\nlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately\nseven years.

At both December 31, 2022\nand 2021, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 4.8billion of non-U.S.\ngovernment-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received\ngross cash proceeds of $ 4.9billion and\n$ 4.8billion at the transfer dates. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair\nvalue of the transferred securities was\n$ 4.7billion and $ 5.0billion. Sales and\nTrading Revenue The Corporation enters\ninto trading derivatives to facilitate\nclient transactions and to manage risk\nexposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment. The related sales and\ntrading revenue generated within Global\nMarkets is recorded in various income\nstatement line items, including market\nmaking and similar activities and net\ninterest income as well as other revenue\ncategories. Sales and trading revenue\nincludes changes in the fair value and\nrealized gains and losses on the sales\nof trading and other assets, net\ninterest income, and fees primarily from\ncommissions on equity securities.\nRevenue is generated by the difference\nin the client price for an instrument\nand the price at which the trading desk\ncan execute the trade in the dealer\nmarket. For equity securities,\ncommissions related to purchases and\nsales are recorded in the \u201cOther\u201d column\nin the Sales and Trading Revenue table.\nChanges in the fair value of these\nsecurities are included in market making\nand similar activities. For debt\nsecurities, revenue, with the exception\nof interest associated with the debt\nsecurities, is typically included in\nmarket making and similar activities.\nUnlike commissions for equity\nsecurities, the initial revenue related\nto broker-dealer\n\nservices for debt securities is\ntypically included in the pricing of the\ninstrument rather than being charged\nthrough separate fee arrangements.\nTherefore, this revenue is recorded in\nmarket making and similar activities as\npart of the initial mark to fair value.\nFor derivatives, the majority of revenue\nis included in market making and similar\nactivities. In transactions where the\nCorporation acts as agent, which include\nexchange-traded futures and options,\nfees are recorded in other income.\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash\ninstruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items\nattributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets ,\ncategorized by primary risk, for 2022, 2021 and 2020. This table includes debit\nvaluation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).\nGlobal Markets results in Note 23 \u2013 Business Segment Information are presented on\na fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis.

Credit\nderivatives derive value based on an\nunderlying third-party referenced\nobligation or a portfolio of referenced\nobligations and generally require the\nCorporation, as the seller of credit\nprotection, to make payments to a buyer\nupon the occurrence of a predefined\ncredit event. Such credit events\ngenerally include bankruptcy of the\nreferenced credit entity and failure to\npay under the obligation, as well as\nacceleration of indebtedness and payment\nrepudiation or moratorium. For credit\nderivatives based on a portfolio of\nreferenced credits or credit indices,\nthe Corporation may not be required to\nmake payment until a specified amount of\nloss has\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America108                                                              \n                                                                                  \noccurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.\nCredit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on\nthe credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation\nconsiders ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade\nincludes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses\ninternal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent\nwith how risk is managed for these instruments.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the preceding table include\ninvestments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan\n                                                                                  \n  109Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nobligation (CLO) and credit-linked note\nvehicles. These instruments are\nprimarily classified as trading\nsecurities. The carrying value of these\ninstruments equals the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any\npayments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned. Credit-related\nContingent Features and Collateral The\nCorporation executes the majority of its\nderivative contracts in the OTC market\nwith large, international financial\ninstitutions, including broker-dealers\nand, to a lesser degree, with a variety\nof non-financial companies. A\nsignificant majority of the derivative\ntransactions are executed on a daily\nmargin basis. Therefore, events such as\na credit rating downgrade (depending on\nthe ultimate rating level) or a breach\nof credit covenants would typically\nrequire an increase in the amount of\ncollateral required of the counterparty,\nwhere applicable, and/or allow the\nCorporation to take additional\nprotective measures such as early\ntermination of all trades. Further, as\npreviously discussed on page 105, the\nCorporation enters into legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nthat reduce risk by permitting closeout\nand netting of transactions with the\nsame counterparty upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. Certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s derivative contracts\ncontain credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the form of ISDA\nmaster netting agreements and credit\nsupport documentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the Corporation held cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 101.3billion\nand $ 91.4billion and posted cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 81.2billion\nand $ 79.3billion in the normal course\nof business under derivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product margining\nagreements where clients are permitted\nto margin on a net basis for both\nderivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain\nOTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can\nbe required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions\nwith certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt\nratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional\ncollateral required depends on the\ncontract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. At December 31,\n2022, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the\ncontracts, that the Corporation and\ncertain subsidiaries could be required\nto post to counterparties but had not\nyet posted to counterparties was $\n3.2billion, including $ 1.6billion for\nBank of America, National Association\n(BANA). Some counterparties are\ncurrently able to unilaterally terminate\ncertain contracts, or the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries may be required to\ntake other action such as find a\nsuitable replacement or obtain a\nguarantee. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the liability recorded for these\nderivative contracts was not\nsignificant. The following table\npresents the amount of additional\ncollateral that would have been\ncontractually required by\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2022 if the\nrating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the\nCorporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional\nsecond incremental notch.

The Corporation\ncalculates valuation adjustments on\nderivatives based on a modeled expected\nexposure that incorporates current\nmarket risk factors. The exposure also\ntakes into consideration credit\nmitigants such as enforceable master\nnetting agreements and collateral. CDS\nspread data is used to estimate the\ndefault probabilities and severities\nthat are applied to the exposures. Where\nno observable credit default data is\navailable for counterparties, the\nCorporation uses proxies and other\nmarket data to estimate default\nprobabilities and severity.\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains\n(losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities),\nwhich are recorded in market making and similar activities, for 2022, 2021 and\n2020. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative\nliabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains\nrelated to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the\nderivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase\nthe cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. FVA\nlosses have the opposite impact.\n                                                                                  \n  Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on

The Corporation also pledged $ 146.6billion of loans with no related\noutstanding borrowings to secure potential borrowing capacity with the Federal\nReserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank.\nThe Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA\nand FHLMC on loans totaling $ 9.5billion and $ 10.5billion at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that\nbecome severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured, and\ntherefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related\nto these loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Commercial nonperforming loans\ndecreased to $ 1.1billion at December 31, 2022 from $ 1.6billion at December 31,\n2021, as paydowns and returns to performing status more than offset new downgrades\nto nonaccrual status. Consumer nonperforming loans decreased to $ 2.8billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 from $ 3.0billion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to\ndecreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from\nloans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in TDRs during the\nfirst quarter of 2022. The following table presents the Corporation\u2019s\nnonperforming loans and leases, including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing\npast due 90days or more at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming LHFS are\nexcluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair\nvalue or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\nWithin the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality\nindicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score.\nRefreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value\nof the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan\nand available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against\nthe property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan,\nrefreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower\nbased on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit\nhistory. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain\nborrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy\nproceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary\ncredit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nand the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal\nclassifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit\nquality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial\nloans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special\nMention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by\nregulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a\nhigh probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not\nconsidered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality\nindicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types\nof loans. The following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross\ncharge-offs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other\nConsumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for\nrevolving loans and revolving loans that were modified into term loans, which are\nshown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2022.\n

Concessions may\ninclude reductions in interest rates,\ncapitalization of past due amounts,\nprincipal and/or interest forbearance,\npayment extensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or combinations\nthereof. Prior to permanently modifying\na loan, the Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with certain\nborrowers under both government and\nproprietary programs. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a\nthree- to four-month period during which\nthe borrower makes monthly payments\nunder the anticipated modified payment\nterms. Upon successful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation and the\nborrower enter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n211million that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by\nthe borrower were included in TDRs at\nDecember 31, 2022, of which $ 53million\nwere classified as nonperforming and $\n33million were loans fully insured. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, remaining\ncommitments to lend additional funds to\ndebtors whose terms have been modified\nin a consumer real estate TDR were not\nsignificant. Consumer real estate\nforeclosed properties totaled $\n121million and $ 101million at December\n31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including\nfully-insured loans, for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in process\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n871million and $ 1.1billion. During 2022\nand 2021, the Corporation reclassified $\n190million and $ 64million of consumer\nreal estate loans to foreclosed\nproperties or, for properties acquired\nupon foreclosure of certain government-\nguaranteed loans (principally FHA-\ninsured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash\ninvesting activities and, accordingly,\nare not reflected in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. The table below\npresents the December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 unpaid principal balance, carrying\nvalue, and average pre- and post-\nmodification interest rates of consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified in\nTDRs during 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Credit card and other consumer loan\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the\ncustomer\u2019s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The\nCorporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by\nthe Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan\nmodifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nprovide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external\nprograms). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral\nvalue and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

                  \n(1) Includes accrued interest and fees.\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are\ndeemed to be in payment default during\nthe quarter in which a borrower misses\nthe second of twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 15percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 15percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing the\nborrower with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique and reflects the\nindividual circumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that result in a\nTDR may include extensions of maturity\nat a concessionary (below market) rate\nof interest, payment forbearances or\nother actions designed to benefit the\nborrower while mitigating the\nCorporation\u2019s risk exposure.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America122                                                              \n                                                                                  \nReductions in interest rates are rare.\nInstead, the interest rates are\ntypically increased, although the\nincreased rate may not represent a\nmarket rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal\nforgiveness in connection with\nforeclosure, short sale or other\nsettlement agreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the loan. At the\ntime of restructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash flows resulting\nfrom the modified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded at the time\nof restructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already been\nrecorded in a previous period such that\nno charge-off is required at the time of\nmodification. During 2022, the carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s commercial\nloans that were modified as TDRs was $\n1.9billion compared to $ 1.3billion and\n$ 1.2billion for 2021 and 2020. At\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation had commitments to lend $\n358million, $ 283million and $\n402million to commercial borrowers whose\nloans were classified as TDRs. The\nbalance of commercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 105million, $ 262million\nand $ 218million at December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $ 6.9billion and\n$ 15.6billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021. Cash and non-cash proceeds from\nsales and paydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $ 32.0billion, $\n43.6billion and $ 20.1billion for 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively . Cash used\nfor originations and purchases of LHFS\ntotaled $ 24.9billion, $ 37.3billion and\n$ 19.7billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Also included were non-\ncash net transfers into LHFS of $\n1.9billion during 2022, primarily driven\nby the transfer of a $ 1.6billion\naffinity card loan portfolio to held for\nsale that was sold in October 2022, and\n$ 808million during 2021. Accrued\nInterest Receivable Accrued interest\nreceivable for loans and leases and\nloans held-for-sale at December 31, 2022\nand 2021 was $ 3.8billion and $\n2.2billion and is reported in customer\nand other receivableson the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Outstanding credit card\nloan balances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During 2022 and 2021, the\nCorporation reversed $ 332million and $\n446million of interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item\nin which it was originally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal balance of\nthe loan.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during 2022\nand 2021, interest and fee income\nreversed at the time the loans were\nclassified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative and qualitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors, such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio and an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. Qualitative\nreserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in\n\nthe quantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted\nlife of the assets. These scenarios\ninclude key macroeconomic variables such\nas gross domestic product, unemployment\nrate, real estate prices and corporate\nbond spreads. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic\nindicators, internal and third-party\neconomist views, and industry trends.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for\ncredit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles . The\nDecember 31, 2022 estimate for allowance\nfor credit losses was based on various\neconomic scenarios, including a baseline\nscenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario\nreflecting an extended moderate\nrecession, a downside scenario\nreflecting persistent inflation and\ninterest rates above the baseline\nscenario, a tail risk scenario similar\nto the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario\nthat considers the potential for\nimprovement above the baseline scenario.\nThe overall economic outlook is weighted\n95percent towards a recessionary\nenvironment in 2023, with continued\ninflationary pressures leading to lower\nGDP and higher unemployment rate\nexpectations as compared to the prior\nyear. The weighted economic outlook\nassumes that the U.S. average\nunemployment rate will be above five and\na half percent by the fourth quarter of\n2023 and will slowly decline to\nfivepercent by the fourth quarter of\n2024. Additionally, in this economic\noutlook, U.S. gross domestic product is\nforecasted to contract at 0.4percent and\ngrow at 1.2percent year-over-year in the\nfourth quarters of 2023 and 2024. For\ncomparison, as of December 31, 2021, the\nweighted economic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nto be just above fivepercent by the\nfourth quarter of 2022 and slowly\ndecline to just under fivepercent by the\nfourth quarter of 2023 and U.S. gross\ndomestic product was forecasted at\n2.1percent and 1.9percent year-over-year\nin the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.\nThe allowance for credit losses at\nDecember 31, 2022 was $ 14.2billion, an\nincrease of $ 379million compared to\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in the\nallowance for credit losses was\nprimarily driven by loan growth and a\ndampened macroeconomic outlook,\npartially offset by a reserve release\nfor reduced pandemic uncertainties. The\nchange in the allowance for credit\nlosses was comprised of a net increase\nof $ 295million in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and an increase of\n$ 84million in the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The increase in the\nallowance for credit losses was\nattributed to increases in the credit\ncard and other consumer portfolios of $\n341million, and commercial portfolio of\n$ 177million, partially offset by a\ndecrease in the consumer real estate\nportfolio of $ 139million. The provision\nfor credit losses increased $ 7.1billion\nto an expense of $ 2.5billion in 2022\ncompared to a benefit of $ 4.6billion in\n2021 and an expense of $ 11.3billion in\n2020. The increase in the provision for\ncredit losses in 2022 was primarily\ndriven by loan growth and a dampened\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset\nby reduced pandemic uncertainties. The\nbenefit in 2021 was primarily due to an\nimproved macroeconomic outlook and\ncredit quality. Outstanding loans and\nleases excluding loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option increased $\n68.7billion in 2022 primarily driven by\ncommercial loans, which increased $\n47.7billion, driven by broad-based\ngrowth, and consumer loans which\n                                                                                  \n  123Bank of America

The Corporation\nroutinely securitizes loans and debt\nsecurities using VIEs as a source of\nfunding for the Corporation and as a\nmeans of transferring the economic risk\nof the loans or debt securities to third\nparties. The assets are transferred into\na trust or other securitization vehicle\nsuch that the assets are legally\nisolated from the creditors of the\nCorporation and are not available to\nsatisfy its obligations. These assets\ncan only be used to settle obligations\nof the trust or other securitization\nvehicle. The Corporation also\nadministers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment\nvehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of\nVIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles. The\ntables in this Note present the assets\nand liabilities of consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2022\nand 2021 in situations where the\nCorporation has continuing involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the\nCorporation\n\notherwise has a variable interest in the\nVIE. The tables also present the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting\nfrom its involvement with consolidated\nVIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which\nthe Corporation holds a variable\ninterest. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure is based on the unlikely event\nthat all of the assets in the VIEs\nbecome worthless and incorporates not\nonly potential losses associated with\nassets recorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet but also potential losses\nassociated with off-balance sheet\ncommitments, such as unfunded liquidity\ncommitments and other contractual\narrangements. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure does not include losses\npreviously recognized through write-\ndowns of assets. The Corporation invests\nin ABS issued by third-party VIEs with\nwhich it has no other form of\ninvolvement and enters into certain\ncommercial lending arrangements that may\nalso incorporate the use of VIEs, for\nexample to hold collateral. These\nsecurities and loans are included in\nNote 4 \u2013 Securities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and\nAllowance for Credit Losses. In\naddition, the Corporation has used VIEs\nin connection with its funding\nactivities.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America124                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or\nunconsolidated VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020 that it was not previously\ncontractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The Corporation\nhad liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value\nguarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 978million and $ 968million at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its\nmortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-\nlien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties,\ngenerally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed\nby government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or\nthe Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-\ninsured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans.\nSecuritization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or\npurchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time,\nsecuritize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities.\nThe Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the\nCorporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including\nsenior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except\nas described in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not\nprovide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard\nrepresentations and warranties.

Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 41million, $\n121million and $ 160million net of hedges, during 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n100.1billion and $ 115.4billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 274million, $ 392million and $\n474million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Servicing advances on\nserviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment,\nwere $ 1.6billion and $ 2.0billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . During 2022, the\nCorporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with\ntotal assets of $ 784million, with no significant deconsolidations in 2021. During\n2020, the Corporation completed the sale of $ 9.3billion of consumer real estate\nloans through GNMA loan securitizations. As part of the securitizations, the\nCorporation retained $ 8.4billion of MBS, which are classified as debt securities\ncarried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales\nof $ 704million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans and leases in the consolidated credit\ncard trust included $ 3.3billion and $ 4.3billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America126                                                              \n                                                                                  \nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s\ninterest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables\nand cash reserve accounts. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation issued new\nsenior debt securities to third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust totaling $ 2.3billion, $ 1.0billion, and $ 1.0billion,\nrespectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held subordinate\nsecurities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional\nprincipal amount of $ 6.7billion and $ 6.5billion. These securities serve as a\nform of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated\ninterest rate of zeropercent. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the credit card\nsecuritization trust issued $ 363million, $ 161million and $ 161million,\nrespectively, of these subordinate securities. Resecuritization Trusts The\nCorporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed\nin a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to\nliquidate the trust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 21.8billion, $ 28.9billion\nand $ 39.0billion of securities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSecurities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to\nthe resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded.\nSecurities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair\nvalue of $ 2.4billion, $ 2.2billion and $ 6.1billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. In 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets. All of the securities received as\nresecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets.\nOf the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020, $ 2.4billion,\n$ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were classified as trading account assets, debt\nsecurities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. Substantially\nall of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as\nLevel 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation\nadministers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate\nmunicipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust\ncertificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party\ninvestors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal\nbond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $\n2.5billion and $ 4.1billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average\nremaining life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2022 was 8.7years.\nThere were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during\n2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n914million and $ 2.9billion at December\n31, 2022 and 2021, including the\nnotional amount of derivatives to which\nthe Corporation is a counterparty, net\nof losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs.\nCollateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The\nCorporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of fixed-income\nsecurities, typically corporate debt or\nABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed\nby third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets\nto these CDOs, holds securities issued\nby the CDOs and may be a derivative\ncounterparty to the CDOs. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs\ntotaled $ 197million and $ 235million at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure\nassociated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $\n2.4billion and $ 2.0billion at December\n31, 2022 and 2021 comprised primarily of\non-balance sheet assets less non-\nrecourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease\nTrusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts\ntotaled $ 1.2billion and $ 1.5billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The trusts\nhold long-lived equipment such as rail\ncars, power generation and distribution\nequipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and\nholds a significant residual interest.\nThe net investment represents the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nthe trusts in the unlikely event that\nthe leveraged lease investments become\nworthless. Debt issued by the leveraged\nlease trusts is non-recourse to the\nCorporation. Tax Credit VIEs The\nCorporation holds investments in\nunconsolidated limited partnerships and\nsimilar entities that construct, own and\noperate affordable housing, wind and\nsolar projects. An unrelated third party\nis typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the\nsignificant activities of the VIE. As an\ninvestor, tax credits associated with\nthe investments in these entities are\nallocated to the Corporation, as\nprovided by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nCode and related regulations, and are\nrecognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of\nIncome in the year they are earned,\n\nwhich varies based on the type of\ninvestments. Tax credits from\nenvironmental, social and governance\n(ESG) investments in affordable housing\nare recognized ratably over a term of up\nto 10 years, and tax credits from wind\nand solar energy investments are\nrecognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax\nCredits (ITCs) or as energy is produced\nfor transactions electing Production Tax\nCredits (PTCs), which is generally up to\na 10-year time period. The volume and\ntypes of investments held by the\nCorporation will influence the amount of\ntax credits recognized each period. The\nmaximum loss exposure included in the\nOther VIEs table was $ 28.8billion and $\n25.7billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021. In addition to that amount, the\nCorporation had unfunded capital\ncontributions for renewable energy\ninvestments of $ 1.9billion and $\n1.0billion at December 31, 2022 and\n2021. The capital contributions are\ncontingent on various conditions\nprecedent to funding over the next two\nyears. The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is\ngenerally mitigated by policies\nrequiring that the project qualify for\nthe expected tax credits prior to making\nits investment. The Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in affordable housing\npartnerships, which are reported in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, totaled $ 14.1billion and $\n12.6billion, including unfunded\ncommitments to provide capital\ncontributions of $ 6.6billion and $\n5.8billion, at December 31, 2022 and\n2021. The unfunded commitments are\nexpected to be paid over the next five\nyears. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefits of $ 1.5billion, $\n1.3billion and $ 1.2billion and reported\npretax losses in other income of $\n1.2billion, $ 1.1billion and $\n1.0billion. These tax credits are\nrecognized as part of the Corporation\u2019s\nannual effective tax rate used to\ndetermine tax expense in a given\nquarter.

and\nRestricted Cash\n\nThe Corporation enters into securities\nfinancing agreements which include\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell and securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase. These financing agreements\n(also referred to as \u201cmatched-book\ntransactions\u201d) are to accommodate\ncustomers, obtain securities to cover\nshort positions and finance inventory\npositions. The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain securities financing\nagreements under the fair value option.\nFor more information on the fair value\noption, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option\n. Offsetting of Securities Financing\nAgreements Substantially all of the\nCorporation\u2019s securities financing\nactivities are transacted under legally\nenforceable master\n\nrepurchase agreements or legally\nenforceable master securities lending\nagreements that give the Corporation, in\nthe event of default by the\ncounterparty, the right to liquidate\nsecurities held and to offset\nreceivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. The Corporation offsets\nsecurities financing transactions with\nthe same counterparty on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet where it has\nsuch a legally enforceable master\nnetting agreement and the transactions\nhave the same maturity date. The\nSecurities Financing Agreements table\npresents securities financing agreements\nincluded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet in federal funds sold and\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell, and in federal\nfunds purchased and securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. Balances are\npresented on a gross basis, prior to the\napplication of counterparty netting.\nGross assets and liabilities are\nadjusted on an aggregate basis to take\ninto consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting\nagreements.

equal to or in excess of the principal amount borrowed. For\nsecurities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of\ncash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value\nof the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued\ndaily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may\nreceive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and\nsecurities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e.,\nno stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to\nthese agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties,\nproviding a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when\nappropriate. Short-term Bank Notes Bank of America, N.A. maintains a global\nprogram to offer up to a maximum of $ 75.0billion outstanding at any one time, of\nbank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven daysfrom\nthe date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled $\n6.2billion and $ 1.8billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These short-term bank\nnotes, along with Federal Home Loan Bank advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan\nnotes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in short-term borrowings on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral The Corporation accepts securities and\nloans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or\nrepledge. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of this collateral was $\n827.6billion and $ 854.8billion, of which $ 764.1billion and $ 782.7billion were\nsold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell. The Corporation also pledges company-owned\nsecurities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and\nloan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be\nsold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically\ndisclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain cases, the Corporation has\ntransferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as\ncollateral for the interests issued by the VIEs.

business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit\nExtension Commitments The Corporation\nenters into commitments to extend credit\nsuch as loan commitments, SBLCs and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.4billion and $ 10.7billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s credit\nextension commitments at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, excluding commitments\naccounted for under\n\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.6billion\nand $ 1.5billion, which predominantly\nrelated to the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The carrying value\nof these commitments is classified in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegally binding commitments to extend\ncredit generally have specified rates\nand maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 3.0billion and $\n4.8billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021\nthat are accounted for under the fair\nvalue option. However, the table\nexcludes the cumulative net fair value\nfor these commitments of $ 110million\nand $ 97million at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, which is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to\npurchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $ 0and $ 949million,\nwhich upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At both December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and\nforward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $ 92.0billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 57.8billion and $ 32.6billion as of both period ends. These\ncommitments generally expire within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 3.7billion\nand $ 4.0billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a\nstrategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nCorporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 571million and $\n395million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The\nCorporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers\nwho offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 4.3\nbillion and $ 6.3billion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation\u2019s maximum\nexposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 632million and $ 928million, with\nestimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Indemnifications In the ordinary\ncourse of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain\nindemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due\nif certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification\nclauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal\ncourse of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote.\nThese agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the\nCorporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future\npayment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several\nreasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict\nfuture changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws\nwould apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in\nstandard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses.\nHistorically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The\nCorporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as\nremote. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a\nsponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges\nthat cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant\nfraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot\nbe collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may\nbe held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is\nprimarily governed by the applicable\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America134                                                              \n                                                                                  \npayment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the\ntype of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of\ntransactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations\nprocessed for the preceding six-month period, which was approximately $\n501billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to\ncircumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future\ndelivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. Exchange and Clearing\nHouse Member Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various securities and\nderivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As\na member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses\nincurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and\nunder other loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be limited\nto its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount\n(or multiple) of the Corporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in\nlimited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under\nthese membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has\nassessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage\nand Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients.\nUnder these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of\nits clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations\nin this respect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and the\naccounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their\ncustomers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements\nis difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nmaterial losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale\nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this\nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored\nmembers to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential\nfor the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration\nthe related collateral, was $ 59.6billion and $ 42.0billion at December 31, 2022\nand 2021. Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions\nsuch as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and\nother transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by\ncertain statutory trust companies that are 100percent owned finance subsidiaries\nof the Corporation. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans\ngenerally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of\nFHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans,\nand sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole\nloans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold\npools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-\nlabel securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these\ntransactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies\nmake and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these\nrepresentations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the\nrequirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide\nindemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts,\nguarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). Unresolved\nRepurchase Claims Unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims\nrepresent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties,\ntypically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the\ntime of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often\nsignificantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of\ncollateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2022 and 2021\nwas $ 5.5billion and $ 8.4billion. These balances included $ 2.2billion and $\n2.8billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of claims related to loans in specific\nprivate-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns\nsubstantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the\nbenefit of any repurchase claims paid. During 2022, the Corporation received $\n82million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2022, $\n3.0billion in claims were resolved. Reserve and Related Provision The reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $\n612million and $ 1.2billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the\nrelated provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation\u2019s\nbest estimate\n                                                                                  \n  135Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nof probable incurred losses, is based on\nits experience in previous negotiations,\nand is subject to judgment, a variety of\nassumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations\nand warranties losses may occur in\nexcess of the amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does\nnot expect such amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's financial condition\nand liquidity. See Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible\nloss in excess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters below,\nwhether a loss in excess of any accrued\nliability is reasonably possible in\nfuture periods. Once the loss\ncontingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nexpense. The Corporation continues to\nmonitor the matter for further\ndevelopments that could affect the\namount of the accrued liability that has\nbeen previously established. Excluding\nexpenses of internal and external legal\nservice providers, litigation and\nregulatory investigation-related expense\nof $ 1.2billion and $ 164million was\nrecognized in 2022 and 2021. For any\nmatter disclosed in this Note for which\na loss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n0.8billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of December 31,\n2022. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below regarding\nthe nature of the litigation and, where\nspecified, associated claimed damages.\nBased on current knowledge, and taking\ninto account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nbelow, will have a material adverse\neffect on the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light of the\nsignificant judgment, variety of\nassumptions and uncertainties involved\nin those matters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control, and\nthe very large or indeterminate damages\nsought in some of those matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more of those\nmatters could be\n\nmaterial to the Corporation\u2019s business\nor results of operations for any\nparticular reporting period, or cause\nsignificant reputational harm. Deposit\nInsurance Assessment On January 9, 2017,\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) filed suit against\nBANA in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d)\nalleging failure to pay a December 15,\n2016 invoice for additional deposit\ninsurance assessments and interest in\nthe amount of $ 542million for the\nquarters ending June 30, 2013 through\nDecember 31, 2014. On April 7, 2017, the\nFDIC amended its complaint to add a\nclaim for additional deposit insurance\nand interest in the amount of $\n583million for the quarters ending March\n31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The\nFDIC asserts these claims based on\nBANA\u2019s alleged underreporting of\ncounterparty exposures that resulted in\nunderpayment of assessments for those\nquarters, and its Enforcement Section is\nalso conducting a parallel investigation\nrelated to the same alleged reporting\nerror. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations as\nthey existed during the relevant time\nperiod and is defending itself against\nthe FDIC\u2019s claims. Pending final\nresolution, BANA has pledged security\nsatisfactory to the FDIC related to the\ndisputed additional assessment amounts.\nOn March 27, 2018, the District Court\ndenied BANA\u2019s partial motion to dismiss\ncertain of the FDIC\u2019s claims. On January\n24, 2023, the magistrate judge assigned\nto the matter by the District Court\njudge held oral argument on the parties\u2019\nmotions for summary judgment and took\nthe motions under advisement. LIBOR\nThe Corporation, BANA and certain\nMerrill Lynch entities have been named\nas defendants along with most of the\nother LIBOR panel banks in a number of\nindividual and putative class actions by\npersons alleging they sustained losses\non U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial\ninstruments as a result of collusion or\nmanipulation by defendants regarding the\nsetting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs\nassert a variety of claims, including\nantitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations (RICO), Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, common law fraud\nand breach of contract claims, and seek\ncompensatory, treble and punitive\ndamages, and injunctive relief. All but\none of the cases naming the Corporation\nand its affiliates relating to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District\nof New York (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d). The\nDistrict Court has dismissed all RICO\nclaims, and dismissed all manipulation\nclaims against Bank of America entities\nbased on alleged trader conduct. The\nDistrict Court has also substantially\nlimited the scope of antitrust,\nCommodity Exchange Act and various other\nclaims, including by dismissing in their\nentirety certain individual and putative\nclass plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims for\nlack of standing. On December 30, 2021,\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit affirmed the dismissal of these\nantitrust claims for lack of standing.\nCertain individual and putative class\nactions remain pending against the\nCorporation, BANA and certain Merrill\nLynch entities. On February 28, 2018,\nthe District Court granted certification\nof a class of persons that purchased OTC\nswaps and notes that referenced U.S.\ndollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar\nLIBOR panel banks, limited to claims\nunder Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America136                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNOTE 13 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n                                                                                  \n  Declared                                                                        \n  Quarterly Cash                                                                  \n  Dividends on                                                                    \n  Common Stock(1)                                                                 \n  Declaration                                                       Dividend Per  \n  Date               Record Date         Payment Date                      Share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  February 1,        March 3, 2023       March 31, 2023      $              0.22  \n  2023                                                                            \n  October 19,        December 2, 2022    December 30,                       0.22  \n  2022                                   2022                                     \n  July 20, 2022      September 2,        September 30,                      0.22  \n                     2022                2022                                     \n  April 27, 2022     June 3, 2022        June 24, 2022                      0.21  \n  February 2,        March 4, 2022       March 25, 2022                     0.21  \n  2022                                                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe cash dividends paid per share of\ncommon stock were $ 0.86$ 0.78and $\n0.72for 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nThe table below summarizes common stock\nrepurchases during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Common Stock Repurchase Summary                                                 \n  (in millions)                                                                   \n  Total share repurchases, including CCAR          2022         2021        2020  \n  capital plan repurchases                          126          615         227  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Purchase price of shares repurchased and     $  5,073    $  25,126    $  7,025  \n  retired(1)                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(1) Consists of repurchases pursuant to\nthe Corporation\u2019s CCAR capital plans.\nDuring 2022, in connection with employee\nstock plans, the Corporation issued\n73million shares of its common stock\nand, to satisfy tax withholding\nobligations, repurchased 28million\nshares of its common stock.

and\nFDIC (collectively, U.S. banking\nregulators) jointly establish regulatory\ncapital adequacy rules, including Basel\n3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a\nfinancial holding company, the\nCorporation is subject to capital\nadequacy rules issued by the Federal\nReserve. The Corporation\u2019s banking\nentity affiliates are subject to capital\nadequacy rules issued by the OCC. The\nCorporation and its primary banking\nentity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced\napproaches institutions under Basel 3.\nAs Advanced approaches institutions, the\nCorporation and its\n\nbanking entity affiliates are required\nto report regulatory risk-based capital\nratios and risk-weighted assets under\nboth the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The approach that yields the\nlower ratio is used to assess capital\nadequacy, including under the Prompt\nCorrective Action (PCA) framework. The\nCorporation is required to maintain a\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio\n(SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage\nbuffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid\ncertain restrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus\npayments. The Corporation\u2019s insured\ndepository institution subsidiaries are\nrequired to maintain a minimum 6.0\npercent SLR to be considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA framework. The\ntable below presents capital ratios and\nrelated information in accordance with\nBasel 3 Standardized and Advanced\napproaches as measured at December 31,\n2022 and 2021 for the Corporation and\nBANA.\n                                                                                  \n  Re\u2026                                                                             \n  Ca\u2026

of December 31, 2022 and 2021, capital ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the\nadoption of the current expected credit losses accounting standard on January 1,\n2020.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and global systemically important bank (G-SIB)\nsurcharge were 2.5percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Corporation\u2019s\nstress capital buffer applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under\nthe Standardized approach was 3.4percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5percent at\nDecember 31, 2021. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero.\nThe CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum\nof 4.5 percent, the Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge of 2.5percent and the\nCorporation\u2019s capital conservation buffer of 2.5percent or the SCB, as applicable,\nof 3.4percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5percent at December 31, 2021. The SLR\nregulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are the\nminimum ratios under Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of\n2.5percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends\nare the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA\nframework.\n\n(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to\nthe qualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America140                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the\nU.S. banking regulators require\ninstitutions to meet the established\nminimums outlined in the table above.\nFailure to meet the minimum requirements\ncan lead to certain mandatory and\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that\ncould have a material adverse impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s financial position. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nCorporation and its banking entity\naffiliates were well capitalized. Other\nRegulatory Matters At December 31, 2022\nand 2021, the Corporation had cash and\ncash equivalents in the amount of $\n5.6billion and $ 4.0billion, and\nsecurities with a fair value of $\n16.6billion and $ 10.6billion that were\nsegregated in compliance with securities\nregulations. Cash and cash equivalents\nsegregated in compliance with securities\nregulations are a component of\nrestricted cash. For more information,\nsee Note 10 \u2013 Securities Financing\nAgreements, Short-term Borrowings,\nCollateral and Restricted Cash . In\naddition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nthe Corporation had cash deposited with\nclearing organizations of $ 20.7billion\nand $ 28.6billion primarily recorded in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Bank Subsidiary Distributions The\nprimary sources of funds for cash\ndistributions by the Corporation to its\nshareholders are capital distributions\nreceived from its bank subsidiaries,\nBANA and Bank of America California,\nN.A. In 2022, the Corporation received\ndividends of $ 22.0billion from BANA and\n$ 250million from Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A. The amount of dividends\nthat a subsidiary bank may declare in a\ncalendar year without OCC approval is\nthe subsidiary bank\u2019s net profits for\nthat year combined with its retained net\nprofits for the preceding two years.\nRetained net profits, as defined by the\nOCC, consist of net income less\ndividends declared during the period. In\n2023, BANA can declare and pay dividends\nof approximately $ 16.1billion to the\nCorporation plus an additional amount\nequal to its retained net profits for\n2023 up to the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration. Bank of America California,\nN.A. can pay dividends of $ 173million\nin 2023 plus an additional amount equal\nto its retained net profits for 2023 up\nto the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration.\n\nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPension and Postretirement Plans The\nCorporation sponsors a qualified\nnoncontributory trusteed pension plan\n(Qualified Pension Plan), a number of\nnoncontributory nonqualified pension\nplans and postretirement health and life\nplans that cover eligible employees.\nNon-U.S.\n\npension plans sponsored by the\nCorporation vary based on the country\nand local practices. The Qualified\nPension Plan has a balance guarantee\nfeature for account balances with\nparticipant-selected investments,\napplied at the time a benefit payment is\nmade from the plan that effectively\nprovides principal protection for\nparticipant balances transferred and\ncertain compensation credits. The\nCorporation is responsible for funding\nany shortfall on the guarantee feature.\nBenefits earned under the Qualified\nPension Plan have been frozen.\nThereafter, the cash balance accounts\ncontinue to earn investment credits or\ninterest credits in accordance with the\nterms of the plan document. The\nCorporation has an annuity contract that\nguarantees the payment of benefits\nvested under a terminated U.S. pension\nplan (Other Pension Plan). The\nCorporation, under a supplemental\nagreement, may be responsible for or\nbenefit from actual experience and\ninvestment performance of the annuity\nassets. The Corporation made\nnocontribution under this agreement in\n2022 or 2021. Contributions may be\nrequired in the future under this\nagreement. The Corporation\u2019s\nnoncontributory, nonqualified pension\nplans are unfunded and provide\nsupplemental defined pension benefits to\ncertain eligible employees. In addition\nto retirement pension benefits, certain\nbenefits-eligible employees may become\neligible to continue participation as\nretirees in health care and/or life\ninsurance plans sponsored by the\nCorporation. These plans are referred to\nas the Postretirement Health and Life\nPlans. The Pension and Postretirement\nPlans table summarizes the changes in\nthe fair value of plan assets, changes\nin the projected benefit obligation\n(PBO), the funded status of both the\naccumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and\nthe PBO, and the weighted-average\nassumptions used to determine benefit\nobligations for the pension plans and\npostretirement plans at December 31,\n2022 and 2021. The estimate of the\nCorporation\u2019s PBO associated with these\nplans considers various actuarial\nassumptions, including assumptions for\nmortality rates and discount rates. The\ndiscount rate assumptions are derived\nfrom a cash flow matching technique that\nutilizes rates that are based on Aa-\nrated corporate bonds with cash flows\nthat match estimated benefit payments of\neach of the plans. The increases in the\nweighted-average discount rates in 2022\nresulted in a decrease to the PBO of $\n5.3billion at December 31, 2022. The\nincreases in the weighted-average\ndiscount rates in 2021 resulted in a\ndecrease to the PBO of approximately $\n895million at December 31, 2021.\nSignificant gains and losses related to\nchanges in the PBO for 2022 and 2021\nprimarily resulted from changes in the\ndiscount rate.\n                                                                                  \n  141Bank of America

applicable\nThe asset valuation method used to calculate the expected return on plan assets\ncomponent of net periodic benefit cost for the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes\n60percent of the prior year\u2019s market gains or losses at the next measurement date\nwith the remaining 40percent spread equally over the subsequent four years. Gains\nand losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are recognized\nin accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable\naccounting guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was\ndetermined using the \u201cprojected unit credit\u201d actuarial method. For the\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans, 50percent of the unrecognized gain or loss\nat the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a\nlevel basis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the\npostretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement\nHealth and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the\nexpected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is\n6.50percent for 2023, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in 2028 and later years.\nThe Corporation\u2019s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is\nsensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the\nQualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension\nPlans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates\nand expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the net\nperiodic benefit cost for 2022.\n                                                                                  \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       9       \u2026                \n         \u2014       \u2014       3       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  143Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nPlan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement\nvehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits\npromised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest\nthe trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing\nbenefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The\nCorporation\u2019s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over\nthe long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts\nto maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate\nby the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and\nlaws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant\nfor establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges\nare established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and\nliability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are\nemployed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional\naspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset\nallocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment\nmeasures. The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a\nU.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are invested prudently so that\nthe benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the\nnature and the duration of the plans\u2019 liabilities. The selected asset allocation\nstrategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The\nexpected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis\nof historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations,\ncurrent market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2019 past\nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected\nreturn on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related\nvalue for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value\nfor the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The\nexpected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of\nthe performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension\nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return\nthat may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension\nPlan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in\nfixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration\nof the plan\u2019s obligations. The target allocations for 2023 by asset category for\nthe Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other\nPension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the\nQualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $\n296million ( 1.72percent of total plan assets) and $ 398million ( 1.80percent of\ntotal plan assets) at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                            \n  2023 Target Allocation                                                    \n                            Percentage                                      \n                            Qualified       Non-U.S.         Nonqualified   \n  Asset Category            Pension Plan    Pension Plans    and Other      \n                                                             Pension Plans  \n  Equity securities         15-50%          0-20%            0-5%           \n  Debt securities           45-80%          40-75%           95-100%        \n  Real estate               0-10%           0-15%            0-5%           \n  Other                     0-5%            10-40%           0-5%           \n                                                                            \nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the\nCorporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20\n\u2013 Fair Value Measurements .

plans. The Corporation\nrecorded expense of $ 1.2billion in\n2022, 2021 and 2020 related to the\nqualified defined contribution plans. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, 179million\nand 173million shares of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock were held by\nthese plans. Payments to the plans for\ndividends on common stock were $\n153million, $ 139million and $\n138million in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Certain non-U.S. employees\nare covered under defined contribution\npension plans that are separately\nadministered in accordance with local\nlaws. NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation\nPlans The Corporation administers a\nnumber of equity compensation plans,\nwith awards being granted predominantly\nfrom the Bank of America Corporation\nEquity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan,\n715million shares of the Corporation\u2019s\ncommon stock are authorized to be used\nfor grants of awards. During 2022 and\n2021, the Corporation granted 102million\nand 99million RSU awards to certain\nemployees under the BACEP. These RSUs\nwere authorized to settle predominantly\nin shares of common stock of the\nCorporation. Certain RSUs will be\nsettled in cash or contain settlement\nprovisions that subject these awards to\nvariable accounting whereby compensation\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based\non changes in the share price of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock up to the\nsettlement date. The RSUs granted in\n2022 will generally vest over four\nyears. Of the RSUs granted in 2021,\n81million will generally vest over four\nyearsand 18million will vest over three\nyears. The four-year awards vest\nprimarily in one-fourth increments on\neach of the first four anniversaries of\nthe grant date while the three-year\nawards vest primarily in one-third\nincrements on each of the first three\nanniversaries of the grant date,\nprovided that the employee remains\ncontinuously employed with the\nCorporation during that time, and will\nbe expensed ratably over the vesting\nperiod, net of estimated forfeitures,\nfor non-retirement eligible employees\nbased on the grant-date fair value of\nthe shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2022\nand 2021 that vest over four years,\n39million and 27million do not include\nretirement eligibility. For all other\nRSUs granted to employees who are\nretirement eligible, they are deemed\nauthorized as of the beginning of the\nyear preceding the grant date when the\nincentive award plans are generally\napproved. As a result, the estimated\nvalue is expensed ratably over the year\npreceding the grant date. The\ncompensation cost for the stock-based\nplans was $ 2.9billion, $ 3.0billion and\n$ 2.1billion, and the related income tax\nbenefit was $ 697million, $ 723million\nand $ 505million for 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. At December 31,\n2022, there was an estimated $\n3.6billion of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to certain\nshare-based compensation awards that is\nexpected to be recognized over a period\nof up to four years, with a weighted-\naverage period of 2.7years.\n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock\nUnits\nThe total fair value of restricted stock\nand restricted stock units vested in\n2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 3.4billion, $\n2.3billion and $ 2.3billion,\nrespectively.

      \nTax Law changes reflect the impact of\nthe 2022, 2021 and 2020 U.K. enacted\ncorporate income tax rate changes, which\nresulted in a negative tax adjustment of\napproximately $ 186million in 2022 and\npositive income tax adjustments of\napproximately $ 2.0billion and $\n700million in 2021 and 2020, with\ncorresponding adjustments of U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets. The U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets are primarily net\noperating losses (NOLs), incurred by the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. broker-dealer entity\nin historical periods, which do not\nexpire under U.K. tax law and are\nassessed regularly for impairment. If\nfurther U.K. tax law changes are\nenacted, a corresponding income tax\nadjustment will be made based on the\namount of available net deferred tax\nassets and applicable tax rate changes.\nTax credits originate from ESG\ninvestments in affordable housing and\nrenewable energy partnerships and\nsimilar entities. Significant increases\nin the tax credits recognized over the\nlast three annual periods have been\nprimarily driven by the Corporation\u2019s\ncontinued growth in the volume of\ninvestments in wind and solar energy\nproduction facilities, consistent with\nthe Corporation\u2019s commitment to support\nthe transition to a lower carbon\neconomy.

Included in\nthe UTB balance are some items the\nrecognition of which would not affect\nthe effective tax rate, such as the tax\neffect of certain temporary differences,\nthe portion of gross state UTBs that\nwould be offset by the tax benefit of\nthe associated federal deduction and the\nportion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that\nwould be offset by tax reductions in\nother jurisdictions. It is reasonably\npossible that the UTB balance may\ndecrease by as much as $ 375million\nduring the next 12 months, since\nresolved items will be removed from the\nbalance whether their resolution results\nin payment or recognition. The\nCorporation recognized an interest\nbenefit of $ 50million in 2022 and\ninterest expense of $ 32million and $\n9million in 2021 and 2020.

losses that may be carried\nforward indefinitely.\n\n(2) The net operating losses and related\nvaluation allowances for U.S. states\nbefore considering the benefit of\nfederal deductions were $ 1.3billion and\n$ 794million.\n\nManagement concluded that novaluation\nallowance was necessary to reduce the\ndeferred tax assets related to the U.K.\nNOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and\ncertain state NOL carryforwards since\nestimated future taxable income will be\nsufficient to utilize these assets prior\nto their expiration. The majority of the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. net deferred tax\nassets, which consist primarily of NOLs,\nare expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Management\u2019s conclusion is\nsupported by financial results, profit\nforecasts for the relevant entities and\nthe indefinite period to carry forward\nNOLs. However, a material change in\nthose estimates could lead management to\nreassess such valuation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, U.S. federal\nincome taxes had not been provided on\napproximately $ 5.0billion of temporary\ndifferences associated with investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries that are\nessentially permanent in duration. If\nthe Corporation were to record the\nassociated deferred tax liability, the\namount would be approximately $\n1.0billion.\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value\nis defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\non the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity\nto maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels\nbased on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information\nregarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation\naccounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more\ninformation, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option. Valuation Techniques The following\nsections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation\u2019s assets and\nliabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies\nor assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. During 2022,\nthere were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had,\nor are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of trading account assets and\nliabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based\non either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt\nsecurities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for\nsimilar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair\nvalues of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price\nquotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a\nmarket sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of\nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates\nthe fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and\nprepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2019s best estimate of current key\nassumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal\nand interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for\nsimilar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other\ninstruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value\nof the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing\nservices, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings.\nSituations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of\ncredit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In\nthese instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market\ninformation and other factors,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America148                                                              \n                                                                                  \nprincipally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements and changes in credit\nratings made by one or more rating agencies. Derivative Assets and Liabilities The\nfair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are\ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including\ninterest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves\nand volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are\nactively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers,\nmarket transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing\nservices are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation.\nEstimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are\neither option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs\nare less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based\nextrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair\nvalues. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments\nfor market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific\nfactors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its\nfair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the\ncredit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by\ncounterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty\ncredit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the\nCorporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its\nfair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives\nand derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it\nreceives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of\nfair value, primarily based on market data. Loans and Loan Commitments The fair\nvalues of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available,\nor discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable\ndebt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable\nborrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as\nappropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of\nthe borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are primarily\ndetermined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of\nprojecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and\ndiscounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. Loans Held-for-\nsale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available,\nor are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates\napproximating the Corporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans\nadjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is\nembedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan\nperformance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms\nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices,\ncurrencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are\nestimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions\nof the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances,\nunobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option\nvolatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these\ninputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in\ndetermining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread\nis determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\nSecurities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase\nagreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are\ndetermined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that\nrequire the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to\ngenerate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority\nof market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nDeposits The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models,\nincluding discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market\ninputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or\npricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively\nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the\nimpact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit\nrisk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash\nmarket. Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair values of asset-backed secured\nfinancings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined\nby discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the\nCorporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the\ninherent credit risk.\n

The Corporation uses multiple market approaches\nin valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market\ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such\nas corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of\nthe unobservable inputs, and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted\ncash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these\ntechniques. The levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed\nin the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly\ndistributed across asset and liability categories. Uncertainty of Fair Value\nMeasurements from Unobservable Inputs Loans and Securities A significant increase\nin market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted\nin a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment\nspeeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the\ninstrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A\nsignificant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair\nvalue for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a\ndirectionally opposite way. Structured Liabilities and Derivatives For credit\nderivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a\nsingle upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads,\ndefault rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair\nvalue for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The\nimpact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts\ndepending on the seniority of the instrument. Structured credit derivatives are\nimpacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes\nthe degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that\nunderlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the\nfair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For\nsenior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in\ndefault correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net\nshort protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite\nway. For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and\nstructured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities\nand correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security\nand an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest\nrates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted\nin a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of\nthe impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For\nstructured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would\nhave resulted in a significantly lower fair value. Nonrecurring Fair Value The\nCorporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain\nsituations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred\nto herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the\nreporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during\n2022, 2021, and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Measured                                                                        \n  at Fair                                                                         \n  Value on                                                                        \n  a                                                                               \n  Nonrecu\u2026        December                                  December              \n  Basis           31, 2022                                  31, 2021              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars                                                                        \n  in               Level 2        Level 3    Level 2         Level 3              \n  million\u2026                                                                        \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Loans       $      1,979    $     3,079               $        634    $     24  \n  held-fo\u2026                                                                        \n  Loans                                                                           \n  and                    \u2014            166                          \u2014         213  \n  leases(\u2026                                                                        \n  Foreclo\u2026                                                                        \n  propert\u2026               \u2014              7                          \u2014           5  \n  3)                                                                              \n  Other                 88            165                        256       2,046  \n  assets                                                                          \n                                    Gains                                         \n                                 (Losses)                                         \n                                     2022                       2021        2020  \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Loans                       $      -387               $        -44    $    -79  \n  held-fo\u2026                                                                        \n  Loans                                                                           \n  and                                 -48                        -60         -73  \n  leases(\u2026                                                                        \n  Foreclo\u2026                             -6                         -2          -6  \n  propert\u2026                                                                        \n  Other                               -91                       -492         -98  \n  assets                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(1) Includes $ 15million, $ 24million and $ 30million of losses on loans that were\nwritten down to a collateral value of zero during 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) Amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and\nrepresent the carrying value of foreclosed properties that were written down\nsubsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed properties.

not applicable\nNOTE 21 Fair Value Option\nLoans and Loan Commitments The\nCorporation elects to account for\ncertain loans and loan commitments that\nexceed the Corporation\u2019s single-name\ncredit risk concentration guidelines\nunder the fair value option. Lending\ncommitments are actively managed and, as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith the Corporation\u2019s public side\ncredit view and market perspectives\ndetermining the size and timing of the\nhedging activity. These credit\nderivatives do not meet the requirements\nfor designation as accounting hedges and\nare carried at fair value. The fair\nvalue option allows the Corporation to\ncarry these loans and loan commitments\nat fair value, which is more consistent\nwith management\u2019s view of the underlying\neconomics and the manner in which they\nare managed. In addition, the fair value\noption allows the Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility that would\notherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial\ninstruments at historical cost and the\ncredit derivatives at fair value. Loans\nHeld-for-sale The Corporation elects to\naccount for residential mortgage LHFS,\ncommercial mortgage LHFS and certain\nother LHFS under the fair value option.\nThese loans are actively managed and\nmonitored and, as appropriate, certain\nmarket risks of the loans may be\nmitigated through the use of\nderivatives. The Corporation has elected\nnot to designate the derivatives as\nqualifying accounting hedges, and\ntherefore, they are carried at\n\nfair value. The changes in fair value of\nthe loans are largely offset by changes\nin the fair value of the derivatives.\nThe fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting\nvolatility that would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created by accounting\nfor the financial instruments at the\nlower of cost or fair value and the\nderivatives at fair value. The\nCorporation has not elected to account\nfor certain other LHFS under the fair\nvalue option primarily because these\nloans are floating-rate loans that are\nnot hedged using derivative instruments.\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets\nThe Corporation elects to account for\ncertain loans that are held for the\npurpose of trading and are risk-managed\non a fair value basis under the fair\nvalue option. Other Assets The\nCorporation elects to account for\ncertain long-term fixed-rate margin\nloans that are hedged with derivatives\nunder the fair value option. Election of\nthe fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting\nvolatility that would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created by accounting\nfor the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at\nfair value. Securities Financing\nAgreements The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain securities financing\nagreements, including resale and\nrepurchase agreements, under the fair\nvalue option. These elections include\ncertain agreements collateralized by the\nU.S. government and its agencies, which\nare generally short-dated and have\nminimal interest rate risk.\n                                                                                  \n  157Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nLong-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-\nrate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify\nfor hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to\nreduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the\nderivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-\nterm deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. Short-\nterm Borrowings The Corporation elects to account for certain short-term\nborrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value\noption because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis. The Corporation\nalso elects to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are also\nclassified in short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the\nfair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-\nbacked secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS\nsecuring these financings at fair value. Long-term Debt The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the\nfair value option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value\nbasis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.

fair value option at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and\ninformation about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities\naccounted for under the fair value option are included in the

Certain loans,\ndeposits, long-term debt, unfunded\nlending commitments and other financial\ninstruments are accounted for under the\nfair value option. For more information,\nsee Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option . The\nfollowing disclosures include financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair\nvalue or only a portion of the ending\nbalance is carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term\nFinancial Instruments The carrying value\nof short-term financial instruments,\nincluding cash and cash equivalents,\ncertain time deposits placed and other\nshort-term investments, federal funds\nsold and purchased, certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements and short-term\n\nborrowings, approximates the fair value\nof these instruments. These financial\ninstruments generally expose the\nCorporation to limited credit risk and\nhave no stated maturities or have short-\nterm maturities and carry interest rates\nthat approximate market. The Corporation\naccounts for certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements under the fair\nvalue option. Under the fair value\nhierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are\nclassified as Level 1.

Global Banking clients generally include\nmiddle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies,\nlarge global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized\nU.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and\nsolutions.

As a result of market-\nmaking activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range\nof financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking\nand underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global\nBanking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. All Other All Other\nprimarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses\nnot otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest\nrate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all\nof the results are allocated to the business segments. Basis of Presentation The\nmanagement accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results\nby utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income\nderived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an\nactivity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and\nassumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the\nbusiness. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on\nan FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an\nFTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment\nresults also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized\nto determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the\nresults of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities\nwith similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments\nwhere the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally\ndeposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities.\nNet interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net\ninterest income generated by certain of the Corporation\u2019s ALM activities. The\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management\nstrategy that incorporates the use of\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America160                                                              \n                                                                                  \nvarious derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and\ncapital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to\nmanage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not\nsignificantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of\nthe Corporation\u2019s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and\nfluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include\nexternal product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the\neffects of the Corporation\u2019s internal funds transfer pricing process and the net\neffects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a\nspecific business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain\ncentralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect\nutilization. Effective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously included in\nthe Global Markets segment is being reported as a liquidating business in All\nOther , consistent with a realignment in performance reporting to senior\nmanagement. While this activity was not material to Global Markets\u2019 results of\noperations and historical results have not been restated, this activity\u2019s\nnoninterest expense of $ 309million and $ 473million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was elevated and would have been excluded\nfrom Global Markets\u2019 results of operations for those periods under the new basis\nof presentation.

The non-U.S.\nbusiness activities are largely\nconducted in Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica and in Asia.
