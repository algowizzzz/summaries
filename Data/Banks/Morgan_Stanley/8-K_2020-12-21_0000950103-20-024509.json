Other Events.\nOn December 18, 2020, Morgan Stanley (\u201cMorgan\nStanley\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) issued a press\nrelease regarding the\nresumption of its common stock repurchase\nplan. A copy of the press release is attached\nhereto as Exhibit 99.1 and\nincorporated into this Item 8.01 by reference.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Board of\nDirectors authorized the repurchase of up to\n$10 billion of outstanding common stock,\ncommencing in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe share repurchases authorized by the Board\nof Directors will be exercised from time to\ntime at prices the Company deems appropriate\nsubject to various factors, including market\nconditions and the Company\u2019s financial\nperformance. The share repurchases may\nbe effected through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including\nthrough Rule 10b5-1 plans.\n\nItem 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain\nOfficers; Election of Directors; Appointment\nof Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements\nof Certain Officers.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, the\nCompensation, Management Development and\nSuccession Committee of the Board of Directors\n(\u201cCMDS Committee\u201d) of\nMorgan Stanley amended the long-term incentive\nprogram\n(\u201cLTIP\u201d) pursuant to which the CMDS Committee\ngrants performance-based stock unit awards to\nkey executives of the\nCompany.\n\nFor the past eleven consecutive\nyears, the Company has granted a meaningful\nportion of annual compensation to key\nexecutives in the form of an LTIP award that\ndelivers value if the Company achieves\nobjective performance goals over a forward-\nlooking three year period and that will remain\nunchanged. Previously, LTIP awards vested and\nconverted to shares after three years only if\nthe Company achieved predetermined\nperformance goals with respect to return on\nequity and relative total shareholder return.\nThe CMDS Committee amended the LTIP with\nrespect to future awards to replace the return\non equity performance goal with a return on\ntangible common shareholder\u2019s\nequity performance goal in order to more\ndirectly align the LTIP awards with the\nCompany\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Current Report on Form\n8-K contains forward-looking statements.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on forward-looking statements, which\nspeak only as of the date on which they are\nmade, which reflect management\u2019s current\nestimates, projections, expectations,\nassumptions, interpretations or beliefs and\nwhich are subject to risks and uncertainties\nthat may cause actual results to differ\nmaterially.
