COMPENSATION                        \n          As in prior years, the CMDS         \n          Committee used a well-defined       \n          framework to determine CEO          \n          compensation for 2023, including    \n          establishing financial and          \n          non-financial performance           \n          priorities based on the Firm\u2019s      \n          strategic objectives and a target   \n          compensation range for the CEO at   \n          the beginning of the year,          \n          assessing Firm and CEO performance  \n          after the end of the year against   \n          the pre-determined performance      \n          priorities and strategic            \n          objectives, and determining         \n          compensation with shareholder       \n          aligned features based on that      \n          performance assessment.             \n          The CMDS Committee assessed Mr.\u00a0    \n          Gorman\u2019s 2023 performance as        \n          outstanding, including setting the  \n          Firm up for success through:        \n          \u2022Visionary leadership and strong    \n          execution of strategy that          \n          transformed the Firm into a         \n          stronger, more resilient, and more  \n          balanced institution                \n          \u2022Intentional talent management      \n          culminating in the successful CEO   \n          succession and leadership           \n          transition                          \n          \u2022The Firm\u2019s solid, resilient        \n          performance in 2023, with the       \n          business model performing as        \n          intended in a challenging market    \n          and macro environment, positioning  \n          the Firm well for future growth     \n          Consistent with our                 \n          pay-for-performance compensation    \n          framework and based on this         \n          performance assessment, Mr.\u00a0        \n          Gorman\u2019s total pay for 2023 was     \n          set at $37 million, with            \n          shareholder-aligned features.       \n          EXEMPLARY CEO SUCCESSION            \n          Mr. Gorman\u2019s exemplary executive    \n          talent development led to the       \n          successful execution of an          \n          orderly, multi-year CEO succession  \n          planning process that is uncommon   \n          in financial services. As           \n          announced by the Board on October\u00a0  \n          25, 2023, Edward (Ted) Pick became  \n          the Firm\u2019s CEO and was elected to   \n          the Board, effective January\u00a01,     \n          2024. At such time, Mr.\u00a0Gorman      \n          stepped down as CEO and became      \n          Executive Chairman. In addition,    \n          Co-President and Head of Wealth     \n          Management, Andrew Saperstein,      \n          also became the Head of Investment  \n          Management; and Daniel Simkowitz    \n          became Co-President of the Firm     \n          and the Head of Institutional       \n          Securities.                         \n          \u200bSuccession planning is one of the   \n          most important responsibilities of  \n          the CEO and the Board. After 14     \n          years of success under Mr.\u00a0         \n          Gorman\u2019s leadership, it was         \n          imperative to the Firm and our      \n          shareholders that the Firm achieve  \n          a seamless transition that built    \n          upon the strength of the franchise  \n          that Mr.\u00a0Gorman and the leadership  \n          team had created.                   \n          \u200bBefore the CEO successor was        \n          announced, many shareholders        \n          expressed concern that the then     \n          current business leaders and CEO    \n          candidates, who had been so         \n          successful in execution of the      \n          Firm\u2019s strategy and the growth of   \n          the Firm, would not be retained     \n          during the transition. After        \n          deliberation over multiple          \n          meetings, and in response to        \n          shareholder concerns about          \n          leadership continuity, the CMDS     \n          Committee granted a $20 million     \n          Staking Award to each of Messrs.\u00a0   \n          Pick, Saperstein and Simkowitz.     \n          The CMDS Committee believes it was  \n          important to stake these three      \n          leaders as a team and chose to      \n          grant the same amount for each      \n          executive to reinforce the message  \n          of collaboration in leadership      \n                                              \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT7  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \n                                              \n  through the transition.

The  \nBoard acknowledges Lord Darling\u2019s             \ndistinguished service and many contributions  \nto Morgan Stanley. As part of the Board\u2019s     \nongoing review of Board composition and       \nsuccession planning, management recommended   \nMegan Butler to the Governance and            \nSustainability Committee as a potential       \ncandidate for election to the Board in light  \nof her extensive background in legal and      \nregulatory matters, including her leadership  \nroles at the PRA and FCA, and financial       \nservices as well as her service as an         \nindependent non-executive director on the     \nboards of Firm subsidiaries Morgan Stanley &  \nCo. International plc (MSIP), Morgan Stanley  \nBank International Limited (MSBIL), and Morgan\nStanley International Limited (MSIL). Based on\nthe recommendation of the Governance and      \nSustainability Committee, the Board           \nunanimously recommends that Ms. Butler be     \nelected as a director at the 2024 annual      \nmeeting of shareholders.                      \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT15  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nDirector Experience, Qualifications,          \nAttributes and Skills When the Board nominates\ndirectors for election at an annual meeting,  \nit evaluates the experience, qualifications,  \nattributes and skills that an individual      \ndirector candidate contributes to the tapestry\nof the Board as a whole to assist the Board in\ndischarging its duties and overseeing the     \nFirm\u2019s strategy.

The\nGovernance and Sustainability Committee       \noversees an orientation program for new       \ndirectors, which includes an overview of      \ndirector duties, our Corporate Governance     \nPolicies, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct \nand other applicable policies. New directors  \nalso receive presentations by senior          \nmanagement on the Firm\u2019s strategy and         \nregulatory framework, its primary business    \nlines, and risk and control framework, and    \nhave a one-on-one session with the CEO. As    \ndirectors are appointed to new committees or  \nassume a leadership role, such as committee   \nchair, they receive additional orientation    \nsessions specific to such responsibilities. We\nalso conduct ongoing educational briefings on \nESG, regulatory and control matters, as well  \nas \u201cdeep dive\u201d presentations on certain       \nbusinesses, emerging risks and focus areas    \nidentified by the Board. In addition, we      \nprovide directors a listing of educational    \nresources and reimburse directors for         \nreasonable costs incurred attending           \neducational sessions on subjects that would   \nassist them in discharging their duties.      \nSenior Management Succession and Development  \nPlanning The CMDS Committee oversees CEO and  \nsenior management succession and development  \nplanning, which covers unexpected as well as  \nplanned events and is formally reviewed, in   \nconjunction with the entire Board, at least   \nannually. Our CEO and our Chief Human         \nResources Officer review recommendations and  \nevaluations of potential internal CEO and     \nsenior management successors, and their       \nqualifications, skills, accomplishments and   \ndevelopmental areas. Potential internal CEO   \nand senior management successors regularly    \nattend Board meetings and engage with Board   \nmembers periodically between Board meetings,  \nincluding during preparatory meetings, client-\nrelated events and visits to our offices      \naround the world. These interactions provide  \nthe Board with the opportunities to become    \nfamiliar with the Firm\u2019s executive talent in  \ndifferent settings, which is critical to the  \nFirm\u2019s succession planning. The goal of       \nsuccession planning deeper into the           \norganization is to ensure that the Firm has a \nbench of well-rounded and capable talent.     \nCareer development is purposeful and intended \nto set the Firm up for long-term future       \nsuccess. CEO and senior leadership succession \nplanning has been a long-standing priority of \nthe Board. For many years James Gorman, as    \nChairman, has worked closely with the other   \nmembers of the Board to ensure an orderly CEO \nsuccession process and leadership transition. \nAs CEO, Mr. Gorman was critical in identifying\nthe right time to step down and for the Board \nto appoint a new CEO and in developing and    \nretaining a world-class executive team with   \nthe outstanding intellect and values required \nto assume the expanded leadership roles to    \nmanage the Firm. The goal of the succession   \nplan was to maintain the stability of the     \nFirm\u2019s outstanding executive team at a        \ncritical transition point and to achieve the  \nleadership continuity that is uncommon in CEO \ntransitions in the financial industry. On     \nOctober 25, 2023, following an intentional and\ntransparent succession planning process, the  \nBoard announced that, effective January 1,    \n2024, Edward (Ted) Pick would succeed Mr.     \nGorman as the Firm\u2019s CEO and that Andrew      \nSaperstein and Daniel Simkowitz would become  \nCo-Presidents. The Board believes its         \nsuccession planning process has demonstrated  \nthe world-class quality and depth of Morgan   \nStanley\u2019s leadership talent and has resulted  \nin the appointment of an outstanding CEO and  \ntwo strong executives as the Firm\u2019s Co-       \nPresidents who will be invaluable leaders in  \nhelping the new CEO to manage the Firm. In    \n2023, various other senior leadership         \nappointments were made to continue developing \nour senior leaders.

Annual        \nEvaluation of Board, Committees and           \nIndependent Lead Director OVERVIEW OF         \nEVALUATION PROCESS The Board believes that    \nestablishing and maintaining a constructive   \nevaluation process is essential to maintaining\nBoard effectiveness and best corporate        \ngovernance practices. Accordingly, the        \nGovernance and Sustainability Committee       \nreviews and approves the evaluation process   \nannually so that the evaluation process       \ncontinues to be effective in identifying areas\nto enhance the performance and effectiveness  \nof the Board, the Independent Lead Director   \nand the Board committees.

To assess        \nindependence, the Board was provided with     \ninformation about relationships between the   \nindependent directors (and their immediate    \nfamily members and affiliated entities) and   \nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates,            \n                                         \n  38MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nincluding information about the directors\u2019    \nprofessional experience and affiliations. In  \nmaking its determination as to the independent\ndirectors, the Board reviewed the categories  \nof relationships between Morgan Stanley and   \nthe directors described above and the         \nfollowing specific relationships under those  \nDirector Independence Standards:              \n                                              \n     Commercial relationships (such as        \n     financial services offered by the Firm   \n     to clients in the ordinary course of     \n     the Firm\u2019s business) in the last three   \n     years between Morgan Stanley and         \n     entities where the directors are         \n     employees or executive officers, or      \n     their immediate family members are       \n  \u2022  executive officers (Mss.

In each case the fees the     \n     Firm received were in compliance with    \n     the Director Independence Standards and  \n     the NYSE rules, and did not exceed the   \n     greater of $1\u00a0million or 2% of such      \n     other entity\u2019s consolidated gross        \n     revenues in any of the last three years  \n     and were considered immaterial to        \n     director independence.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Director\u2019s utilization of Morgan         \n     Stanley products and services offered    \n     by the Firm as a client of the Firm      \n     (such as Wealth Management brokerage     \n     accounts and investments in funds        \n     sponsored by the Firm) in the ordinary   \n     course of the Firm\u2019s business on terms   \n     and conditions substantially similar to  \n  \u2022  those provided to unaffiliated third     \n     parties (Messrs.

In each   \n     case the provision of such products and  \n     services was in compliance with the      \n     Director Independence Standards and the  \n     NYSE rules and was considered            \n     immaterial to director independence.     \n                                              \nDirector Attendance at Annual Meeting The     \nCorporate Governance Policies state that      \ndirectors are expected to attend our annual   \nmeetings of shareholders.

Each current  \ndirector attended at least 75% of the total   \nnumber of meetings of the Board and committees\non which such director served that were held  \nduring 2023 while the director was a member.  \nIn addition to Board and committee meetings,  \nour directors also engaged in less formal     \ncommunications between meetings, including    \ndiscussions, briefings and educational        \nsessions, with the Independent Lead Director, \nChairman, CEO, committee chairs, members of   \nsenior management and others as appropriate   \nregarding matters of interest. The Board\u2019s    \nstanding committees have oversight over risk  \nmanagement and risk assessment guidelines and \npolicies related to each committee\u2019s duties   \nand responsibilities. Each committee          \ncoordinates with management and the other     \ncommittees of the Board to help ensure that it\nhas received the information necessary to     \npermit it to fulfill its duties and           \nresponsibilities with respect to oversight of \nrisk management.

ASSESSMENT OF          \nLEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT The   \nBoard has determined that its leadership      \nstructure is appropriate for the Firm to      \nleverage Mr. Gorman\u2019s and Mr. Pick\u2019s extensive\nknowledge of the Firm\u2019s strategic initiatives,\nfacilitate a seamless leadership transition   \nbetween Mr. Gorman and Mr. Pick, and build on \nthe success the Firm has achieved under Mr.   \nGorman\u2019s tenure to facilitate the leadership  \ntransition. Mr. Pick\u2019s strategic leadership,  \nstrong track record of building and growing   \nour client franchise, developing and retaining\ntalent, allocating capital with sound risk    \nmanagement, and carrying forward our culture  \nand values, position him well to serve as CEO.\nMr. Gorman\u2019s role as former CEO, his existing \nrelationship with the Board, his deep         \nunderstanding of Morgan Stanley\u2019s businesses  \nand strategy, and his professional experience \nand leadership skills uniquely position him to\nserve as Chairman.

excessive risk and that   \n     such programs do not create risks that   \n     are reasonably likely to have a          \n     material adverse effect on the Firm.     \n  \u00b0  The CRO reviewed

The Board believes that a      \ndirector\u2019s total compensation should include a\nsignificant equity component because it       \nbelieves that this more closely aligns the    \nlong-term interests of directors with those of\nshareholders and provides a continuing        \nincentive for directors to foster the Firm\u2019s  \nsuccess. In furtherance of these goals, our   \ndirectors are bound by a shareholder-approved \nannual compensation (cash and equity) limit of\n$750,000 and an equity ownership requirement  \nof five times the annual cash Board retainer  \n(as described in more detail below under      \n\u201cDirector Equity Ownership Requirement\u201d).     \nDirectors\u2019 compensation for the public company\nis determined by the Board, and the Governance\nand Sustainability Committee makes            \nrecommendations to the Board based on periodic\nbenchmarking assessments and advice received  \nfrom FW Cook, its independent advisor. No     \nchanges were made to our director compensation\nprogram in 2023.                              \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT49  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nThe following table contains information with \nrespect to the annual compensation (including \ndeferred compensation) of our non-employee    \ndirectors earned during 2023 with respect to  \ntheir Board service.                          \n                                              \n                         C\u2026                   \n         F\u2026              in                   \n         E\u2026              P\u2026                   \n         or      S\u2026      V\u2026      All          \n  \u2026      P\u2026      A\u2026      a\u2026      Ot\u2026      T\u2026  \n         in      (\u2026      N\u2026      Co\u2026      (\u2026  \n         C\u2026              D\u2026      ($)          \n         (\u2026              C\u2026                   \n                         E\u2026                   \n                         (\u2026                   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      8\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      2\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Messrs.

\nappointed Deloitte as independent auditor for \nthe year ending December 31, 2024, and,       \nalthough not legally required to do so,       \npresents this selection to the shareholders   \nfor ratification as a matter of governance    \nbest practices. The Audit Committee believes  \nthat the continued retention of Deloitte is in\nthe best interest of the Firm and its         \nshareholders. Deloitte was selected as        \nindependent auditor upon the merger creating  \nthe current Firm in 1997 and has served       \ncontinuously as independent auditor since that\ntime. Deloitte will audit the Firm\u2019s          \nconsolidated financial statements included in \nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year   \nending December 31, 2024, and will perform    \nother permissible, pre-approved services. If  \nshareholders do not ratify the appointment of \nDeloitte, the Audit Committee will consider   \nthis in determining whether to appoint        \nDeloitte as independent auditor for the year  \nending December 31, 2025. Even if the         \nappointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, \nin its discretion, may change the appointment \nat any time during the year if it determines  \nthat such a change would be in the best       \ninterest of the Firm and its shareholders.    \nDeloitte representatives will attend the      \nannual meeting. They will be present to       \nrespond to appropriate shareholder questions  \nand will have the opportunity to make a       \nstatement if they desire to do so. Our Board  \nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201dthe \nratification of Deloitte\u2019s appointment as our \nindependent auditor. Proxies solicited by the \nBoard will be voted \u201cFOR\u201dthis ratification    \nunless otherwise instructed.                  \n                                         \n  54MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                 \n  Audit Matters  \n                 \nAudit Committee Report The Audit Committee\u2019s  \ncharter, available at                         \nwww.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance,    \nprovides that the Audit Committee is          \nresponsible for the oversight of the integrity\nof the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial          \nstatements, the Firm\u2019s system of internal     \ncontrol over financial reporting, certain     \naspects of the Firm\u2019s risk management as      \ndescribed in the charter, the qualifications  \nand independence of the independent registered\naccounting firm engaged as the \u201cindependent   \nauditor,\u201d the performance of the Firm\u2019s       \ninternal auditor and independent auditor, and \nthe Firm\u2019s compliance with legal and          \nregulatory requirements.

At the 2023 \nannual meeting of shareholders, approximately \n96% of the votes cast were in favor of our    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In light of the        \nsignificant majority of votes cast in favor of\nthe 2022 compensation of our NEOs, the CMDS   \nCommittee maintained its performance-based    \napproach to executive compensation for 2023   \nand believes that our current program         \nappropriately links the compensation of our   \nNEOs to performance and properly aligns the   \ninterests of our NEOs with those of our       \nshareholders. As discussed in the CD&A, the   \n2023 pay decision for the CEO was made by the \nCMDS Committee, in consultation with the      \nBoard. Based on an evaluation of Mr. Gorman\u2019s \n2023 performance as outstanding, including    \nsetting the Firm up for success through:      \n                                              \n     Visionary leadership and strong          \n     execution of strategy that transformed   \n  \u2022  the Firm into a stronger, more           \n     resilient, and more balanced             \n     institution                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Intentional talent management            \n  \u2022  culminating in the successful CEO        \n     succession and leadership transition     \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm\u2019s solid, resilient performance  \n     in 2023, with the business model         \n  \u2022  performing as intended in a challenging  \n     market and macro environment,            \n     positioning the Firm well for future     \n     growth                                   \n                                              \nMr. Gorman\u2019s total pay for 2023 was set at $37\nmillion, with shareholder-aligned features.   \nMr. Gorman\u2019s exemplary executive talent       \ndevelopment led to the successful execution of\nan orderly, multi-year CEO succession planning\nprocess that is uncommon in financial         \nservices. Succession planning is one of the   \nmost important responsibilities of the CEO and\nthe Board. After 14 years of success under Mr.\nGorman\u2019s leadership, it was imperative to the \nFirm and our shareholders that the Firm       \nachieve a seamless transition that built upon \nthe strength of the franchise that Mr. Gorman \nand the leadership team had created. After    \ndeliberation over multiple meetings, and in   \nresponse to shareholder concerns about        \nleadership continuity, the CMDS Committee     \ngranted one-time awards to stake the incoming \nCEO and Co-Presidents as a team and to        \nreinforce the message of collaboration in     \nleadership through the transition. The        \nstrategy was to maintain the leaders of the   \nthree business segments, and the CMDS         \nCommittee believes that the one-time awards   \nare appropriate to help ensure the success of \nthis strategy, the continued success of the   \nFirm and its long-term strategy, and the      \ninterests of shareholders. The Firm does not  \nhave a practice of granting one-off awards to \nincumbents and the CMDS Committee views       \n                                         \n  58MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nthese awards as an intentional approach to    \naddressing shareholder concerns in an effort  \nto achieve an atypical outcome within the     \nfinancial industry and to ensure leadership   \ncontinuity, and to galvanize this team and    \nfocus them on working together for the future \ncreation of shareholder value. Over his tenure\nas CEO and during 2023, Mr. Gorman reshaped   \nthe Firm into a stronger, more resilient, and \nmore balanced institution positioned for long-\nterm growth. As a result, against a mixed     \nbackdrop, the Firm\u2019s business model performed \nas intended and showed durability and growth, \ndespite the challenges in 2023, including     \nuncertainty regarding the future path of      \ninterest rates and concerns related to        \nheightened geopolitical risks that pressured  \ndeposits, strategic activity and capital      \nraising. Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership, 2023  \nresults reflected the strategic transformation\nof the Firm poised for future growth:         \n                                              \n     The Firm achieved total shareholder      \n     return of 14% and premium valuation      \n     relative to core banking peers (since    \n  \u2022  2010, when Mr.\u00a0Gorman became CEO, the    \n     stock price has more than tripled and    \n     market capitalization has increased      \n     from $40\u00a0billion to $153\u00a0billion).       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Over 60% of the Firm\u2019s Pre-Tax Profit    \n     came from the Firm\u2019s Wealth and          \n     Investment Management businesses (up     \n  \u2022  from approximately 30% in 2010 and net   \n     revenues from both businesses have more  \n     than doubled since 2010), providing      \n     durability to the franchise.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Institutional Securities continued to    \n     show the benefits of the integrated      \n  \u2022  investment bank with top-tier wallet     \n     share positions in Equities (~20%),      \n     Investment Banking (~15%) and Fixed      \n     Income (~10%).                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm reported full-year ROTCE of     \n  \u2022  12.8% against a mixed backdrop and a     \n     number of headwinds.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     The standardized CET 1 Ratio at          \n     December\u00a031, 2023 was 15.2%, 230bps      \n     above our risk-based capital regulatory  \n     requirement inclusive of buffers and     \n     evidence of our prudent capital          \n  \u2022  management.                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm continued to increase returns   \n     to shareholders.

The CMDS Committee\u2019s\ncommitment to these compensation objectives is\ndemonstrated in the structure of executive    \ncompensation and in the CMDS Committee\u2019s CEO  \npay framework detailed in this CD&A. The CMDS \nCommittee set CEO total compensation for 2023 \nat $37 million, with shareholder-aligned      \nfeatures (see Section 1.4 \u201cCEO Compensation   \nDetermination\u201d). This determination was based \non an evaluation of 2023 Firm and CEO         \nperformance against predetermined performance \npriorities and strategic objectives, and an   \nassessment of Firm performance as solid,      \nresilient, and well-positioned for future     \ngrowth, with the Firm\u2019s business model        \nperforming as intended in a challenging market\nand macro environment in 2023, and CEO        \nperformance as outstanding, including         \nvisionary leadership and strong execution of  \nstrategy that transformed the Firm into a     \nstronger, more resilient and more balanced    \ninstitution, and intentional talent management\nculminating in the successful CEO succession  \nand leadership transition.                    \n                                         \n  60MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nCEO SUCCESSION PROCESS James Gorman\u2019s         \nexemplary executive talent development led to \nthe successful execution of an orderly, multi-\nyear CEO succession planning process that is  \nuncommon in the financial industry. This      \nprocess demonstrated the world-class quality  \nand depth of Morgan Stanley\u2019s leadership      \ntalent, and resulted in the Board\u2019s           \nappointment of an outstanding CEO and two     \nstrong executives as the Firm\u2019s Co-Presidents,\nwho will be invaluable leaders in helping the \nnew CEO manage the Firm. As announced by the  \nBoard on October 25, 2023, Edward (Ted) Pick  \nbecame the Firm\u2019s CEO and was elected to the  \nBoard, effective January 1, 2024. At such     \ntime, Mr. Gorman stepped down as CEO and      \nbecame Executive Chairman. In addition, Co-   \nPresident and Head of Wealth Management,      \nAndrew Saperstein, also became the Head of    \nInvestment Management and Daniel Simkowitz    \nbecame Co-President of the Firm and the Head  \nof Institutional Securities. Succession       \nplanning is one of the most important         \nresponsibilities of the CEO and the Board.    \nAfter 14 years of success under Mr. Gorman\u2019s  \nleadership, it was imperative to the Firm and \nour shareholders that the Firm achieve a      \nseamless transition that built upon the       \nstrength of the franchise that Mr. Gorman and \nthe leadership team had created. It was       \ncrucial to the Firm and our shareholders that \nthe Board select the best-suited candidate as \nCEO and also retain and motivate the remaining\nstrong candidates to support him. The         \nanticipated CEO transition was publicly       \nconfirmed at the Firm\u2019s 2023 annual meeting of\nshareholders. The Firm engaged with           \nshareholders regarding the succession process \nboth during the Firm\u2019s annual engagement with \nshareholders in the post-proxy statement off- \nseason and after the CEO successor was        \nannounced. Before the CEO successor was       \nannounced, many shareholders expressed concern\nthat the then-current business leaders and CEO\ncandidates, who had been so successful in     \nexecution of the Firm\u2019s strategy and the      \ngrowth of the Firm, would not be retained     \nduring the transition, which often happens in \nCEO changes in the financial industry. After  \ndeliberation over multiple meetings, and in   \nresponse to shareholder concerns about        \nleadership continuity, the CMDS Committee     \nrecognized the CEO transition as a rare and   \nappropriate circumstance in which to grant    \none-time awards. In order to promote          \nleadership continuity, reinforce the priority \nof collaboration in leadership and evolving   \nthe Firm\u2019s strategy, and continue to create   \nlong-term shareholder value through the       \ntransition, the CMDS Committee determined it  \nwas in the Firm\u2019s and our shareholders\u2019 best  \ninterests to award each of the three leaders a\none-time award. After the CEO successor was   \nannounced, representatives of the Firm,       \nincluding the CMDS Committee Chair and the    \nBoard\u2019s Independent Lead Director (who is also\na member of the CMDS Committee), engaged with \nshareholders to discuss the succession        \nplanning process and the one-time awards. As  \nthe Firm previously disclosed, the CMDS       \nCommittee approved a one-time staking award   \nfor each of the incoming CEO and Co-Presidents\n(Staking Awards) with a grant value of $20    \nmillion and shareholder-aligned features (for \na discussion of the decision process,         \nobjectives, and design of the Staking Awards, \nsee Section 4.4 \u201cOne-Time Staking Awards      \nSupport CEO Succession and Leadership         \nTransition.\u201d) The CMDS Committee believes it  \nwas important to stake these three leaders as \na team and chose to grant the same amount for \neach executive to reinforce the message of    \ncollaboration in leadership through the       \ntransition. These Staking Awards are intended \nto address shareholder concerns and support   \nthe Firm\u2019s and shareholders\u2019 interests in     \nretaining and incentivizing key executives    \nduring an important time in the Firm\u2019s        \nhistory. The Staking Awards support leadership\ncontinuity and will incentivize continued     \noutstanding performance of the team during the\ntransition period. The strategy was to        \nmaintain the leaders of the three business    \nsegments, and the CMDS Committee believes that\nthe Staking Awards are appropriate to help    \nensure the success of this strategy, the      \ncontinued success of the Firm and its long-   \nterm strategy, and the interests of           \nshareholders. The Firm does not have a        \npractice of granting one-time awards to       \nincumbents, and the CMDS Committee views the  \nStaking Awards as an intentional approach to  \naddressing shareholder concerns in an effort  \nto achieve full leadership continuity         \nfollowing an internal CEO transition, an      \natypical outcome in the financial industry.   \nThe Staking Awards are not part of annual     \nregular compensation for executives\u2019 new      \nroles. Differentiation of pay by roles and    \nperformance will occur with 2024 and future   \nannual compensation decisions.                \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT61  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nFor a discussion of Mr. Gorman\u2019s strategic    \ntalent management that led to the seamless CEO\ntransition, see Section 1.3 \u201cPerformance      \nHighlights\u2014CEO Succession Based on Multi-Year \nIntentional Talent Development Process.\u201d For a\ndiscussion of the decision process,           \nobjectives, and design of the Staking Awards, \nsee Section 4.4 \u201cOne-Time Staking Awards      \nSupport CEO Succession and Leadership         \nTransition.\u201d For a discussion of the topics   \ndiscussed during engagement with shareholders \nand our responses, see Section 1.5 \u201cOngoing   \nShareholder Engagement and \u2018Say on Pay\u2019 Vote.\u201d\n2023 RESULTS REFLECT STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION \nOver his tenure as CEO and during 2023, Mr.   \nGorman reshaped the Firm into a stronger and  \nmore balanced institution positioned for long-\nterm growth. As a result, against a mixed     \nbackdrop, the Firm\u2019s business model performed \nas intended and showed durability and growth, \ndespite the challenges in 2023, including     \nuncertainty regarding the future path of      \ninterest rates and concerns related to        \nheightened geopolitical risks that pressured  \ndeposits, strategic activity and capital      \nraising.

This     \napproach enables the CMDS Committee to make a \nbalanced and informed pay decision that is    \naligned with performance. The CMDS Committee\u2019s\nCEO compensation framework supports and       \nreinforces the Firm\u2019s pay-for-performance     \nphilosophy and incorporates four key steps.   \nCEO Compensation Framework 1. SET FINANCIAL   \nAND NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PRIORITIES In   \nthe context of the Firm\u2019s strategic           \nobjectives, at the beginning of the year, the \nBoard sets annual performance priorities.     \nPerformance priorities include both \ufb01nancial  \nand non-\ufb01nancial performance metrics for the  \nFirm and its business segments. See Section   \n3.1 \u201cFactors Considered in Compensation       \nDecisions\u2014Performance Priorities.\u201d 2.         \nESTABLISH TARGET COMPENSATION RANGE Each year,\nthe CMDS Committee establishes a target       \ncompensation range for the CEO and outlines   \nguidelines for the CEO performance assessment \nat year end. At the start of 2023, the CMDS   \nCommittee, in consultation with its           \nindependent compensation consultant Semler    \nBrossy, established a target range for CEO    \ncompensation as well as                       \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT63  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nthe factors to be considered in determining   \nyear-end compensation.

See Section 3.2 \u201cEvaluating Firm  \nand Individual Performance for Alignment with \nExecutive Compensation.\u201d 4. DETERMINE         \nCOMPENSATION BASED ON PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT  \nThe CMDS Committee determines CEO compensation\nafter year end based on its performance       \nassessment and discussion with the Board. The \nCMDS Committee determines the form and mix of \nCEO compensation that supports the Firm\u2019s key \ncompensation objectives.

CEO SUCCESSION BASED ON MULTI-  \nYEAR INTENTIONAL TALENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS   \nCEO and executive leadership succession has   \nbeen a long-standing priority of Mr. Gorman   \nand, as CEO and Chairman of the Board, he     \nplanned for many years to ensure an orderly   \nsuccession process. Mr. Gorman identified an  \nappropriate time to step down as CEO and was  \nstrategic and deliberate over multiple years  \nin providing the optimal career and leadership\nopportunities to develop a world-class        \nexecutive team with the outstanding skills,   \nexperience, and values to lead the Firm for   \nfuture success. Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership,\nthe succession process and leadership         \ntransition were executed in exemplary fashion,\ndemonstrating Mr. Gorman\u2019s success in         \nattracting, developing, and retaining a deep  \nbench of world-class quality leadership talent\nand successfully resulting in the Board\u2019s     \nappointment of an outstanding CEO and two     \nstrong executives as the Firm\u2019s Co-Presidents,\nwho will be invaluable leaders in helping the \nnew CEO manage the Firm. Mr. Gorman\u2019s multi-  \nyear plan achieved continuity of the Firm\u2019s   \nexceptional executive team at a critical      \ntransition point, an achievement that is      \nuncommon in CEO transitions in the financial  \nindustry and one that many of the Firm\u2019s      \nshareholders expressed concern could not be   \nachieved.                                     \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT67  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nMr. Gorman also planned for succession deeper \ninto the organization, with the goal of       \nensuring that the Firm has a deep bench of    \nwell-rounded and capable talent.

The CMDS Committee also   \nbased its 2023 CEO pay decision on its        \nassessment of Mr. Gorman\u2019s outstanding        \nperformance in executing the CEO succession,  \nthe transition of leadership and the          \nresolution of a significant legal and         \nregulatory matter. The CMDS Committee         \ndetermined that a 2023 pay decision for Mr.   \nGorman of $37 million, with shareholder       \naligned features, was appropriate.            \n                                              \n      This is the amount the CMDS Committee   \n      awarded to the CEO in early 2024 for    \n  **  2023 performance. This amount differs   \n      from the SEC required disclosure in     \n      the \u201c2023 Summary Compensation Table.\u201d  \n                                              \nAnnual NEO pay in a given year is typically   \ndelivered in a combination of fixed           \ncompensation (base salary), cash bonus, and   \ndeferred incentive compensation provided in   \ntime-vested deferred restricted stock units   \n(RSUs) and a long-term incentive program award\nin the form of performance-vested stock units \n(PSUs), with the same key features as the CEO \ncompensation elements. In determining the     \nportions of compensation to award as cash     \nbonus, deferred incentive compensation, RSUs  \nand PSUs, the CMDS Committee considers        \napplicable regulatory requirements and        \nguidelines for deferral, as well as market    \npractices and shareholder feedback. A         \nsignificant portion of pay is deferred, all of\nwhich is awarded in equity, subject to future \nstock price performance and cancellation and  \nclawback and, in the case of PSUs, future     \nachievement of specified financial objectives \nover a three-year period. The CMDS Committee  \nbelieves that the significant weighting of    \ncompensation mix in equity is aligned with the\ninterests of shareholders by encouraging focus\non the long-term success of the Firm while    \nmitigating excessive risk-taking, and a       \ncompetitive annual cash incentive compensation\nopportunity promotes performance. Section 3.2 \ncontains more details about individual NEO    \nperformance. Section 4.1 contains the 2023    \ncompensation decisions for each NEO, which    \nfollows a similar performance evaluation      \nprocess as for the CEO.                       \n

Morgan   \nStanley is committed to open and ongoing      \ncommunication with our shareholders and takes \nthe opportunity to engage with shareholders   \ndirectly on compensation and other matters to \nunderstand their perspectives and provide     \ninformation about Morgan Stanley\u2019s executive  \ncompensation program, performance assessment  \nand decision-making process. We highly value  \nengaging with our shareholders and have a     \ndemonstrable history of being responsive to   \ntheir feedback.                               \n                                         \n  70MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nA substantial majority (approximately 99%) of \nthe votes cast at the May 2023 annual meeting \nof shareholders were in favor of holding our  \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal annually (as opposed to \nevery two or three years). Our Board          \nrecognizes that an annual advisory vote on    \nexecutive compensation allows our shareholders\nto provide us every year with their view on   \nour compensation philosophy, policies and     \npractices as disclosed annually in the proxy  \nstatement, and believes that an annual        \nadvisory vote on executive compensation is    \nconsistent with our practice of seeking the   \nviews of, and engaging in discussions with,   \nour shareholders on corporate governance      \nmatters and our executive compensation        \nphilosophy, policies and practices. A         \nsubstantial majority (approximately 96%) of   \nthe votes cast at the May 2023 annual meeting \nof shareholders were in favor of our annual   \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In 2023, we continued  \nour engagement program, seeking feedback from \nshareholders and proxy advisory firms on a    \nvariety of topics, including our strategy,    \nfinancial performance, executive compensation,\ncorporate governance, human capital           \nmanagement, and environmental and social      \ngoals. The feedback that we received during   \nthe engagement program was conveyed to the    \nCMDS Committee and the Board, and we made     \nseveral enhancements to our disclosures that  \nare responsive to the key areas of the        \nfeedback we received, as summarized in the    \ntable below. Shareholders who provided        \nfeedback during our engagement program        \ngenerally praised the quality of the Firm\u2019s   \ndisclosure and reported that the Committee\u2019s  \nuse of discretion in the administration of the\nexecutive compensation program is reasonable  \nand that executive compensation at Morgan     \nStanley is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. Shareholders also generally      \nemphasized their support for the Firm\u2019s       \nleadership team, the Firm\u2019s strategy and long-\nterm performance, and the Firm\u2019s annual       \ncompensation program for executives. The CMDS \nCommittee also factored shareholder feedback, \nincluding the \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote results, into \nits consideration of the executive            \ncompensation structure and determination of   \n2023 NEO pay levels. After carefully          \nconsidering shareholder feedback and other    \nfactors, the CMDS Committee maintained its    \nperformance-based approach to executive       \ncompensation for 2023.                        \n                                              \n  What We      \u200b                Our Response:  \n  Heard:                                      \n               Annual                         \n               Executive                      \n               Compensation                   \n                               We enhanced    \n                               our            \n                               disclosure to  \n                               provide        \n                               further        \n  Some                         detail on our  \n  shareholde\u2026                  disciplined    \n  wanted to                    performance    \n  better                       assessment     \n  understand                   process to     \n  how the      \u200b                determine      \n  CMDS                         pay.

Framework for Making Compensation Decisions\n3.1 Factors Considered in Compensation        \nDecisions The 2023 compensation of the NEOs   \nwas determined by the CMDS Committee after    \nconsideration of Firm business results,       \nstrategic performance, and individual         \nperformance (including from a risk management \nperspective), as well as competitor           \ncompensation data and, with respect to the    \nCEO, benchmarking data, and other             \nconsiderations set forth below. The CMDS      \nCommittee regularly reviews (i) Firm          \nperformance with respect to execution of      \nstrategic objectives and evaluates executive  \nperformance in light of such performance; (ii)\nexecutive compensation strategy, including the\ncompetitive environment and the design and    \nstructure of the Firm\u2019s compensation programs \nto ensure that they are consistent with and   \nsupport our compensation objectives; and (iii)\nmarket trends and legislative and regulatory  \ndevelopments affecting compensation in the    \nU.S. and globally. The CMDS Committee approves\nexecutive annual incentive compensation after \na comprehensive review and evaluation of Firm,\nbusiness unit and individual performance for  \nthe year, and reviews these compensation      \ndecisions with our Board. PERFORMANCE         \nPRIORITIES For 2023, a number of quantitative \nand qualitative performance priorities were   \nset by the CMDS Committee and the Board at the\nbeginning of the year. The performance        \npriorities are established based on a         \ndirectional assessment made at the beginning  \nof the year in light of the market environment\nand the Firm\u2019s strategic objectives, and their\nattainment or non-attainment does not         \ncorrespond to any specific compensation       \ndecision. To                                  \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT73  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \ninform its decision-making process for NEO    \ncompensation for 2023, the CMDS Committee     \nevaluated Firm and individual performance in  \nlight of the pre-established performance      \npriorities. See Section 1.2 \u201cFramework for CEO\nCompensation Decision\u201d and Section 3.2        \n\u201cEvaluating Firm and Individual Performance   \nfor Alignment with Executive Compensation.\u201d   \nFor 2023, the CMDS Committee reviewed         \nperformance priorities in the following areas:\nRISK MANAGEMENT The Firm maintains strong risk\nmanagement policies and considers the risk    \nattributes of the Firm\u2019s incentive            \ncompensation arrangements and incorporates    \nfinancial and non-financial risk management   \nperformance factors, including conduct risk,  \nin making compensation decisions. For a       \ndescription of the Firm\u2019s processes for taking\nrisk management into consideration in         \ncompensation decisions, see \u201cCompensation     \nGovernance and Risk Management.\u201d COMPENSATION \nMARKET DATA During 2023, the CMDS Committee   \nreviewed analyses of our competitors\u2019 pay     \nlevels, including historical compensation data\nobtained from public filings and compensation \nsurveys conducted by consultants on an        \nunattributed basis, as well as compensation   \nplan design. While market data provides the   \nCMDS Committee with useful information        \nregarding our competitors, the CMDS Committee \ndoes not target specific pay positioning      \n(e.g., a specific percentile), nor does it use\na formulaic approach in determining           \ncompetitive pay levels. Instead, the CMDS     \nCommittee uses the data as a reference, which \nis considered in the context of each NEO\u2019s    \nperformance over a multi-year period, and the \nCMDS Committee\u2019s assessment of the value the  \nindividual delivers to the Firm. The Firm uses\na Comparison Group to understand market       \npractices and trends, evaluate the            \ncompetitiveness of our compensation programs, \nand inform compensation decisions. Our        \nComparison Group consists of companies that   \neither directly compete with the Firm for     \nbusiness and/or talent or are global          \norganizations with scope, size, or other      \ncharacteristics similar to those of the Firm. \n                                         \n  74MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nBENCHMARKING TARGET CEO PAY As discussed in   \nSection 1.2 \u201cFramework for CEO Compensation   \nDecision,\u201d the CMDS Committee, in consultation\nwith its independent compensation consultant, \nSemler Brossy, maintained a target range for  \n2023 compensation for the CEO of $40 million  \nor more for strong performance exceeding      \nexpectations to $20 million or less for       \nperformance below expectations. To inform its \ndecision-making with respect to the           \nappropriate target range, the CMDS Committee  \nreviewed available 2022 compensation levels   \nfor selected financial companies in the S&P   \n100 Index, which are intended to reflect      \ninstitutions of similar size, scope, and      \ncomplexity. The CMDS Committee then utilized  \nthe range of results as a benchmark from which\nto set the target range for 2023 compensation \nfor the CEO. RELATIVE PAY CONSIDERATIONS We   \nplace importance on the pay relationships     \namong members of our Operating Committee,     \nbecause we view our Operating Committee       \nmembers as highly talented executives capable \nof rotating among the leadership positions of \nour businesses and key functions. Our goal is \nalways to be in a position for the Board to   \nappoint our most senior executives from within\nour Firm and to incentivize our people to     \naspire to senior executive roles. At year end,\nthe CMDS Committee reviewed the relative      \ndifferences between the compensation for the  \nCEO and other NEOs and between the NEOs and   \nother members of the Operating Committee. Pay \ndecisions were determined based on the NEO\u2019s  \nposition during 2023 and not in consideration \nof positions effective as of January 1, 2024; \ncompensation decisions for 2024 performance   \nwill be made after 2024 performance is known  \nusing the CMDS Committee\u2019s compensation       \nframework described herein. INPUT AND         \nRECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CEO, INDEPENDENT     \nDIRECTORS, AND INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT At the  \nend of the year, Mr. Gorman presented the CMDS\nCommittee with performance assessments and    \ncompensation recommendations for each NEO,    \nother than himself. The performance assessment\nprocess was significantly enhanced from prior \nyears. See the \u201cCompensation Governance and   \nRisk Management\u201d section of this proxy        \nstatement for a description of the performance\nassessment process. The CMDS Committee        \nreviewed these recommendations in light of the\nperformance assessments with its independent  \ncompensation consultant, Semler Brossy, to    \nassess whether they were reasonable compared  \nwith the market for executive talent and met  \nin executive session to discuss the           \nperformance of our CEO and the other NEOs and \nto determine their compensation. In addition, \nthe CMDS Committee and Board reviewed proposed\nNEO incentive compensation with Mr. Gorman,   \nand the CMDS Committee reviewed CEO           \ncompensation with the Board (other than Mr.   \nGorman). COMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSIDERATIONS  \nPrior to determining individual NEO incentive \ncompensation, the CMDS Committee reviewed and \nconsidered the relationship between Firm      \nperformance, total compensation expense (which\nincludes compensation costs such as base      \nsalaries, allowances, benefits, commissions,  \namortization of prior deferred compensation   \nawards and severance costs), and incentive    \ncompensation as a subset of overall           \ncompensation expense. This exercise furthers  \nthe balancing of the objectives of delivering \nreturns for shareholders, while providing     \nappropriate rewards to motivate superior      \nindividual performance.                       \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT75  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nGLOBAL REGULATORY PRINCIPLES The Firm\u2019s       \ncompensation practices are subject to         \noversight by our regulators in the U.S. and   \ninternationally. For example, the Firm is     \nsubject to the Federal Reserve guidance that  \nis designed to help ensure that incentive     \ncompensation paid by a banking organization   \ndoes not encourage imprudent risk-taking that \nthreatens the organization\u2019s safety and       \nsoundness. The Firm is also subject to the    \ncompensation-related provisions of the Dodd-  \nFrank Act, as well as the remuneration code of\nthe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the  \nU.K. Prudential Regulation Authority Rulebook,\nwhich prescribes the compensation structure   \nfor certain employees who are identified as   \nmaterial risk-takers, and the European Banking\nAuthority guidelines on sound remuneration    \npolicies. COMPENSATION CONTROLS Together with \nsenior management, the CMDS Committee oversees\nthe Firm\u2019s controls regarding the year-end    \ncompensation process, including policies and  \nprocedures for compensation plan governance,  \nfunding and allocating the incentive          \ncompensation pool and the use of discretion in\ndetermining individual incentive compensation \nawards; processes for identifying \u201crisk-      \ntaking\u201d employees; and processes to administer\nincentive compensation clawback and           \ncancellation features. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY      \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code   \n(Section 162(m)) limits the tax deductibility \nof compensation for certain executive officers\nthat is more than $1 million. The CMDS        \nCommittee continues to have the flexibility to\npay nondeductible compensation if it believes \nit is in the best interests of the Firm. 3.2  \nEvaluating Firm and Individual Performance for\nAlignment with Executive Compensation As set  \nforth in Section 1.3 \u201cPerformance Highlights,\u201d\nin determining the annual incentive           \ncompensation of the CEO and other NEOs, the   \nCMDS Committee weighed the Firm\u2019s overall     \nfinancial performance and, as applicable,     \nbusiness unit performance and achievement of  \nits long-term strategic objectives. Management\nreviewed the Firm\u2019s forecasted 2023 financial \nperformance with the CMDS Committee in        \nDecember 2023, along with both financial and  \nnon-financial risk metrics, and the CMDS      \nCommittee assessed full-year actual financial \nresults before finalizing compensation        \ndecisions in January 2024. FIRM FINANCIAL     \nPERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES In 2023, \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s clear strategy and balanced  \nbusiness model enabled the Firm to deliver    \nsolid financial results against a mixed market\nbackdrop and headwinds, including uncertainty \nregarding the future path of interest rates   \nand concerns related to heightened            \ngeopolitical risks that pressured deposits,   \nstrategic activity and capital raising. The   \nCMDS Committee considered these results, as   \nwell as the performance indicated below, in   \ndetermining compensation for our NEOs.        \n                                              \n                            \u2022\u2003Achieved net    \n                            revenues of       \n                            $54.1\u00a0billion,    \n                            up 1% from 2022,  \n                            demonstrating     \n                            the stability of  \n                            our model as      \n                            strength in       \n                            Wealth            \n                            Management        \n  Firm  \u200b                    offset declines   \n                            in Institutional  \n                            Securities.       \n                            Achieved Net      \n                            Income of $9.1\u00a0   \n                            billion and EPS   \n                            of $5.18, which   \n                            were down 18%     \n                            and 16%,          \n                            respectively,     \n                            from 2022         \n        \u2022\u2003Delivered                           \n        ROTCE of 12.8%                        \n        and Efficiency                        \n        Ratio of 77% in                       \n        2023 as compared                      \n        with ROTCE of                         \n        15.3% and                             \n        Efficiency Ratio                      \n        of 73% in 2022.                       \n        2023 results                          \n        reflect expenses                      \n        related to                            \n  \u200b      severance costs,                      \n        an FDIC special                       \n        assessment, and                       \n        a legal charge                        \n        related to a                          \n        specific matter.                      \n        The combination                       \n        of these items                        \n        negatively                            \n        impacted ROTCE                        \n        and Efficiency                        \n        Ratio by 105 bps                      \n        and 164 bps,                          \n        respectively                          \n        \u2022\u2003Strong capital                      \n        position                              \n        reflected in                          \n        CET1 Ratio of                         \n        15.2%.

In         \ndetermining the appropriate pay mix for our   \nNEOs, the CMDS Committee considers the fixed  \nand variable, and upfront and deferred,       \ncomponents of their respective pay. Each NEO  \nreceives a fixed base salary and is eligible  \nto receive variable discretionary annual      \nincentive compensation for prior year         \nperformance. Annual incentive compensation is \nintended to reward NEOs for achievement of the\nFirm\u2019s financial and strategic objectives over\nthe prior year, and individual performance,   \nincluding risk management, and is delivered in\na mix of a cash bonus and deferred incentive  \ncompensation in the form of deferred equity.  \nThe amount of incentive compensation that is  \ndeferred is based on a deferral table, which  \nprovides for a more significant deferral at   \nhigher incentive compensation levels. For     \n2023, the CMDS Committee granted 100% of each \nNEO\u2019s deferred incentive compensation in      \nequity-based RSUs and PSUs, aligning          \ncompensation with shareholders\u2019 interests.

\ngranted on January 17, 2024 (2024 PSUs) tie a \nmeaningful portion of each NEO\u2019s compensation \nto the Firm\u2019s long-term financial performance \nand reinforce the NEO\u2019s accountability for the\nachievement of the Firm\u2019s financial and       \nstrategic objectives by directly linking the  \nultimate realizable award value to prospective\nperformance against core financial measures   \nover a three-year period. GENERAL TERMS The   \n2024 PSUs will vest and convert to shares of  \nthe Firm\u2019s common stock at the end of the     \nthree-year performance period upon the Firm\u2019s \nachievement of predetermined performance      \nobjectives with respect to the Firm\u2019s average \nROTCE and the Firm\u2019s average ROTCE relative to\nthe ROTCE of each member of a peer group, as  \nset forth below, over the period beginning on \nJanuary 1, 2024, and ending on December 31,   \n2026. These performance objectives are        \nconsistent with, and drive, the Firm\u2019s long-  \nterm strategy, reflective in the strategic    \nobjectives in Section 1.3 and the performance \npriorities in Section 3.1. While each         \nparticipant was awarded a target number of    \nperformance stock units, the actual number of \nunits earned could vary from zero, if         \nperformance objectives are not met, to up to  \n1.5 times target, if performance objectives   \nare meaningfully exceeded. No participant will\nreceive any portion of the PSU award if the   \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \nThe 2024 PSUs earn cash dividends that accrue \ninterest at the short-term Treasury rate then \nin effect, compounded monthly, through the    \nscheduled conversion date. The PSU awards     \nremain subject to cancellation upon certain   \nevents until they are converted to shares of  \nFirm common stock. If, after conversion of the\nPSU awards, the CMDS Committee determines that\nthe performance certified by the CMDS         \nCommittee was based on materially inaccurate  \nfinancial statements, then the shares         \ndelivered will be subject to clawback by the  \nFirm. PSU awards are also subject to any      \nclawback policy adopted by the Firm from time \nto time, including to comply with applicable  \nrules and regulations (including the Dodd-    \nFrank Act and the regulations and listing     \nstandards adopted thereunder). The Firm has   \nadopted a clawback policy (the Morgan Stanley \nCompensation Recoupment Policy) to comply with\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations and    \nlisting standards adopted thereunder.         \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT83  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nPERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES One-half of the target \nPSU award is earned based on the Firm\u2019s       \naverage ROTCE over the three-year performance \nperiod (MS Average ROTCE). The other half of  \nthe target PSU award is earned based on the   \nFirm\u2019s average ROTCE over the three-year      \nperformance period relative to the ROTCE of   \neach member of a peer group (ROTCE Comparison \nGroup) over the same three-year performance   \nperiod (Relative ROTCE). The number of stock  \nunits ultimately earned will be determined by \nmultiplying each half of the target award by a\nmultiplier as follows (for performance between\ntwo thresholds, straight-line interpolation   \napplies):                                     \n                                              \n  MS                     Relat\u2026               \n  Aver\u2026      Multi\u2026      ROTCE\u2026      Multip\u2026  \n  ROTC\u2026                                       \n  16%                    75th                 \n  or           1.50      perce\u2026         1.50  \n  more                   or                   \n                         more                 \n  13%          1.00      55th           1.00  \n                         perce\u2026               \n  8%           0.50      25th           0.50  \n                         perce\u2026               \n  Less                   Less                 \n  than         0.00      than           0.00  \n  8%                     25th                 \n                         perce\u2026               \n                                              \n                                              \n     MS Average ROTCE, for this purpose,      \n     excludes: (a) the impact of debt         \n     valuation adjustments; (b) certain       \n     gains or losses associated with the      \n     sale of specified businesses; (c)        \n     certain gains or losses associated with  \n     specified legal settlements relating to  \n     business activities conducted prior to   \n     January\u00a01, 2011; and (d) specified       \n  *  cumulative catch-up adjustments          \n     resulting from changes in, or            \n     application of, a new accounting rule    \n     that are not applied on a full           \n     retrospective basis.

The CMDS  \nCommittee reviews the structure and terms of  \nthe PSU program at least annually. The CMDS   \nCommittee believes that an absolute and       \nrelative ROTCE objective is aligned with Firm \nstrategic objectives, given that ROTCE is a   \nkey Firm performance priority and that the    \nsignificant proportion of executive           \ncompensation awarded in the form of equity    \nawards appropriately aligns executives\u2019       \ninterests with those of shareholders and      \nmotivates executives to work to achieve strong\nshareholder returns. In addition, ROTCE is an \nobjective financial measure used as a         \nperformance criterion in performance equity   \nprograms of many of the Firm\u2019s peers. As      \ndescribed in further detail in note 2 to the  \n\u201c2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\u201d table, each\nof our NEOs received a PSU award in January   \n2023 (2023 PSUs) on similar terms as described\nabove. PSU PROGRAM PERFORMANCE The CMDS       \nCommittee has consistently set challenging    \nperformance objectives for our PSUs. The      \nvariability over time of the percentage of our\nPSUs that have been earned demonstrates a     \nstrong pay-for-performance link. Since the    \ninception of the program in 2009, the average \nof the payouts of all 12 annual PSU awards up \nto and including the PSUs granted in 2021     \n(2021 PSUs) is 110% of target.                \n                                         \n  84MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nPSU Program Performance As described in note 3\nto the \u201c2023 Stock Vested\u201d table, 2021 PSUs   \nvested at 142% of target, based on performance\nover the three-year performance period ended  \nDecember 31, 2023. ADJUSTMENTS PSU award terms\nrequire the CMDS Committee to equitably adjust\nthe calculation of performance measures based \non publicly reported information to maintain  \nthe intended economics and to carry out the   \nintent of the original terms of PSUs if an    \nevent occurs that, in the determination of the\nCommittee, renders such measures to no longer \nbe appropriate. UBS reported amounts related  \nto the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS    \nthat UBS management believes are not          \nrepresentative of the underlying performance  \nof the businesses. As a result, the CMDS      \nCommittee approved the equitable adjustment of\nUBS\u2019 2023 ROTCE, as utilized in the           \ncalculation of relative ROTCE in the 2023     \nPSUs, to exclude the impact of the Credit     \nSuisse acquisition. In addition, in light of  \nthe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, the  \nCMDS Committee removed Credit Suisse from the \npeer group for 2023 PSUs. 4.4 One-Time Staking\nAwards Support CEO Succession and Leadership  \nTransition In consultation with its           \nindependent compensation consultant, Semler   \nBrossy, the CMDS Committee approved a one-time\nStaking Award to each of Messrs. Pick,        \nSaperstein and Simkowitz in connection with   \nthe CEO succession and leadership transition  \nprocess. The CMDS Committee believes it was   \nimportant to stake these three leaders as a   \nteam and, after deliberation over multiple    \nmeetings, chose to grant the same amount, mix,\nand structure for each executive to reinforce \nthe message of collaboration in leadership    \nthrough the transition. This is in line with  \nthe historical management and compensation    \nphilosophy of the Firm that has allowed the   \nFirm to successfully promote from within. This\nmanagement and compensation philosophy will   \nallow the Firm to make senior management      \ntransitions without disrupting the positive   \nmomentum achieved over the years in evolving  \nthe Firm\u2019s strategy and creating long-term    \nshareholder value. The CMDS Committee set the \nvalue of the Staking Awards at an amount that \nit believes is incentivizing, yet appropriate.\nEach Staking Award has a grant date fair value\nof $20 million, which is approximately the    \naverage of the annual variable compensation of\nthe three executives. The Firm does not have a\npractice of granting one-time awards to       \nincumbents and the CMDS Committee views the   \nStaking Awards as an intentional approach to  \naddressing shareholder concerns in an effort  \nto achieve full leadership continuity         \nfollowing an internal CEO transition, an      \natypical outcome in the financial industry.   \nThe Staking Awards are not part of annual     \nregular compensation for executives\u2019 new      \nroles. Differentiation of pay by roles and    \nperformance will occur with 2024 and future   \nannual compensation decisions.                \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT85  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nDECISION PROCESS AND OBJECTIVES The CMDS      \nCommittee determined that granting the Staking\nAwards to each of the incoming CEO and Co-    \nPresidents was in the best interests of the   \nFirm and its shareholders as the Firm         \ntransitioned from 14 years of exceptional     \nleadership by Mr. Gorman. The CMDS Committee  \ngranted the Staking Awards in acknowledgment  \nof the Board\u2019s assessment of the criticality  \nto the continued success of Morgan Stanley and\nprogress of the Firm\u2019s long-term strategy of  \nensuring that each executive continues their  \noutstanding leadership in their new roles at  \nthe Firm. The independent members of the CMDS \nCommittee deliberated over multiple meetings  \nover the course of 2023, at both regularly    \nscheduled and special meetings, taking into   \nconsideration feedback from its independent   \ncompensation consultant, Semler Brossy, and   \nfrom shareholders received during the proxy   \noff-season engagement, and considered the     \nappropriate award recipients and various award\nvalues (both lower and higher), alternative   \nperformance metrics, different lengths of     \nperformance periods, and alternative mixes of \ntime-based and performance-based equity, and  \ndifferent terms and conditions for the Staking\nAwards before deciding on the final design.   \nThe recipients of the Staking Awards were not \npresent during or involved in any of these    \ndeliberations. AWARD DESIGN The Staking Awards\nare 100% equity, with 60% delivered in PSUs   \n(Staking Award PSUs) and 40% delivered in RSUs\n(Staking Award RSUs). The majority of each    \nStaking Award is performance-based and the    \nStaking Award RSUs support many of the same   \nshareholder-aligned objectives as the Staking \nAward PSUs and provide a balanced package     \ntogether with the Staking Award PSUs. The mix \nis consistent with the Firm\u2019s annual deferred \ncompensation awards, which the CMDS Committee \nbelieves is consistent with shareholder       \ninterests, as supported by the Firm\u2019s         \nhistorically high Say on Pay vote results. The\nmix allows for focus on performance metrics,  \nwhile also providing a balance of time-based  \nequity to focus on long-term shareholder value\ncreation. The mix also achieves balance by    \nincentivizing appropriate risk-taking, while  \nmitigating against excessive risk-taking. The \nStaking Awards are designed to reinforce the  \nexecutive\u2019s accountability for the Firm\u2019s     \nfuture financial goals and directly tie       \ncompensation outcomes to shareholder-based    \nvalue creation over a multi-year period in a  \nbalanced manner that does not encourage       \nimprudent risk-taking. Consistent with the    \nFirm\u2019s annual PSU and RSU awards: (1) the     \nStaking Award PSUs have a three-year          \nperformance period (2024-2026), vest only if  \nthe Firm achieves predetermined performance   \ngoals based equally on relative and absolute  \nROTCE, and may deliver zero shares if the     \nperformance goals are not met and up to 1.5x  \nthe target number of shares granted if the    \nperformance goals are meaningfully exceeded;  \nand (2) the Staking Award RSUs vest and       \nconvert to shares after three years (on       \nJanuary 25, 2027). The Staking Award PSUs will\nconvert in 2027 after the CMDS Committee      \ncertifies that the performance goals have been\nmet. Given a recent review of the Firm\u2019s PSU  \nprogram in 2022 with the Committee\u2019s          \nindependent compensation consultant and the   \nFirm\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and resulting       \nupdates to the program, the CMDS Committee    \ndetermined that the program\u2019s equal weighting \nof absolute and relative ROTCE performance    \nmetrics, three-year performance period and    \nperformance grid were appropriate for the     \nStaking Award PSUs in order to maintain       \nalignment with the Firm\u2019s financial and       \nstrategic objectives. In the CMDS Committee\u2019s \nbest judgment, maintaining uniform performance\nmetrics over the same performance period      \nbetween annual awards and Staking Awards would\nbe more motivating and drive more focused     \nperformance than granting a Staking Award that\nintroduced different performance metrics and a\ndifferent performance period. The Staking     \nAward RSUs encourage leadership continuity    \nthrough vesting conditions and mitigate       \nimprudent risk-taking over the deferral period\ndue to cancellation provisions and being      \ndenominated in stock and therefore having     \ntheir value indexed to the value of the Firm\u2019s\nstock price from grant until conversion to    \nshares. The Staking Awards contain other      \nimportant governance features. For example,   \nthey do not contain a provision for vesting   \nupon achievement of retirement eligibility,   \nare subject to cancellation for resignation or\ncompetitive activity, and are subject to the  \nMorgan Stanley Compensation Recoupment Policy \nand the Morgan Stanley Equity                 \n                                         \n  86MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nOwnership Commitment.

For 2023, the CMDS Committee\nretained an independent compensation          \nconsultant, Semler Brossy, to assist the CMDS \nCommittee in collecting and evaluating        \nexternal market data regarding executive      \ncompensation and performance and to advise the\nCMDS Committee on developing trends and best  \npractices in executive compensation and equity\nand incentive plan design. In performing these\nservices, Semler Brossy attended meetings of  \nthe CMDS Committee regularly, including       \nportions of the meetings without management   \npresent, and separately with the CMDS         \nCommittee Chair. Semler Brossy was an         \nindependent advisor to the CMDS Committee in  \n2023 and did not and does not provide any     \nother services to the Firm or its executive   \nofficers that could jeopardize their          \nindependent status. The Firm has affirmatively\ndetermined that no conflict of interest has   \narisen in connection with the work of Semler  \nBrossy as compensation consultant for the CMDS\nCommittee. The CMDS Committee made            \ncompensation decisions for 2023 in            \nconsultation with Semler Brossy, as discussed \nin Section 1.2 \u201cFramework for CEO Compensation\nDecision,\u201d Section 3.1 \u201cFactors Considered in \nCompensation Decisions\u2014Input and              \nRecommendations From the CEO, Independent     \nDirectors, and Independent Consultant,\u201d and   \nSection 4.4 \u201cOne-Time Staking Awards Support  \nCEO Succession and Leadership Transition.\u201d    \nSTOCK OWNERSHIP COMMITMENT NEOs are subject to\na robust Equity Ownership Commitment, which is\ndiscussed in detail in this proxy statement   \nunder \u201cOwnership of Our Stock\u2014Executive Equity\nOwnership Commitment.\u201d NO HEDGING OR PLEDGING \nFirm policy prohibits NEOs from pledging,     \nselling short, engaging in hedging strategies,\nor trading derivatives involving Morgan       \nStanley securities.

In      \naddition, deferred incentive compensation     \nawards are subject to robust cancellation and \nclawback provisions described in the table    \nbelow. Throughout the year, employee conduct  \nmatters are reviewed to determine whether they\npresent situations that could require clawback\nor cancellation of previously awarded         \ncompensation, as well as downward adjustments \nto current-year compensation. Clawbacks of    \npreviously awarded compensation are reviewed  \nwith the Employee Discipline Oversight        \nCommittee (a committee of senior management   \ncurrently composed of the Chief Financial     \nOfficer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Risk      \nOfficer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Human     \nResources Officer, and the Head of Non-       \nFinancial Risk) (EDOC) and reported to the    \nCMDS Committee. In addition, the Global       \nIncentive Compensation Discretion Policy      \nadopted by the CMDS Committee sets forth      \nstandards for managers on the use of          \ndiscretion when making annual compensation    \ndecisions and considerations for assessing    \nrisk management and outcomes. Further, the    \nFirm\u2019s control functions participate in a     \nreview of employee conduct with respect to    \nrisk management matters and are asked to      \nidentify inappropriate behavior that may not  \nbe captured through other Firm processes. The \nresults of the reviews are reflected in       \nperformance feedback and considered in        \npromotion and compensation decisions. New in  \n2023, the Firm\u2019s Control Function Assessment  \nCommittee (CFAC), a management committee      \nreporting to the CMDS Committee, has          \nresponsibility for oversight of the Firm\u2019s    \nprocess for collecting input, information and \nmetrics regarding the risk management         \nperformance of the Operating Committee members\nand other employees and reviewing such        \ninformation to produce recommendations to help\nensure that the incentive compensation        \noutcomes for such employees are consistent    \nwith their risk management performance.

         \nNO CHANGE IN CONTROL TAX GROSS-UP PROTECTION  \nNEOs are not contractually entitled to any    \ngolden parachute excise tax protection upon a \nchange in control of Morgan Stanley and are   \nnot entitled to severance pay upon termination\nof employment in excess of broad-based        \nbenefits. NO EXECUTIVE PENSIONS Firm-provided \nretirement benefits in the U.S. include a tax-\nqualified 401(k) plan (401(k) Plan) and a     \nfrozen tax-qualified pension plan (the        \nEmployees Retirement Plan (ERP)). No NEO is   \nawarded with credited service in excess of his\nor her actual service under the ERP. Pension  \nand retirement benefits provided to NEOs are  \ndiscussed in further detail under \u201c2023       \nPension Benefits.\u201d HEALTH AND INSURANCE       \nBENEFITS All NEOs are eligible to participate \nin Firm-sponsored health and insurance benefit\nprograms available in the relevant            \njurisdiction to similarly situated employees. \nIn the U.S., higher compensated employees pay \nmore to participate in the Firm\u2019s medical     \nplan. NEOs are also eligible to participate in\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Executive Health Program,    \nunder which each NEO is eligible to receive   \nFirm-funded access to a private primary care  \nphysician offering on-call services and an    \nannual executive healthcare assessment. Upon  \nretirement, NEOs are eligible for Firm-paid   \nretiree health coverage for themselves and    \neligible dependents. NO EXCESSIVE PERQUISITES \nThe Firm provides personal benefits to certain\nof the NEOs for competitive, health, and      \nproductivity reasons. The Firm\u2019s Board-       \napproved policy authorizes the CEO to use the \nFirm\u2019s aircraft. As of January 1, 2010, Mr.   \nGorman entered into a time-share agreement    \nwith the Firm permitting him to reimburse the \nFirm for the incremental cost of his personal \nuse of the Firm\u2019s aircraft. In 2023, the CEO  \ngenerally reimbursed the Firm for the         \nincremental cost of his personal use of the   \nFirm\u2019s aircraft within permitted regulatory   \nmaximums and other NEOs are generally not     \nauthorized to use the Firm\u2019s aircraft for     \npersonal reasons unless they receive prior    \npermission from both the CEO and the Chief    \nLegal Officer and reimburse the Firm for the  \nincremental cost of their personal use of the \nFirm\u2019s aircraft in an amount not to exceed    \npermitted regulatory maximums. Personal       \nbenefits provided to NEOs are discussed in    \nfurther detail under \u201c2023 Summary            \nCompensation Table.\u201d SHARE USAGE Morgan       \nStanley pays a significant portion of         \nincentive compensation as deferred equity     \nawards, which aligns the interests of the     \nFirm\u2019s employees with those of its            \nshareholders. The Firm strives to maximize    \nemployee and shareholder alignment through the\nuse of deferred equity awards, while          \nminimizing dilution. The Firm\u2019s share         \nrepurchase program offsets the dilutive impact\nof these additional shares. 5.

No      \ndirector who served on the CMDS Committee     \nduring fiscal year 2023 is, or has been,      \nemployed by us or any of our subsidiaries.    \nNone of our executive officers serve as a     \nmember of a board of directors or compensation\ncommittee of any entity that has one or more  \nexecutive officers who serve on our Board or  \nCMDS Committee.                               \n                                         \n  92MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nExecutive Compensation The following tables   \nsummarize the compensation of our NEOs in the \nformat specified by the SEC. 2023 Summary     \nCompensation Table Pursuant to SEC rules, the \nfollowing table is required to include for a  \nparticular year only those stock awards and   \noption awards granted duringthe year, rather  \nthan awards granted afteryear end that were   \nawarded for performance in that year. Our     \nannual equity awards relating to performance  \nin a year are made shortly after year end.    \nTherefore, compensation in the table includes \nnot only non-equity compensation awarded for  \nservices in the applicable year but, in the   \ncase of stock awards granted in the years     \nreported in the table, compensation awarded   \nfor performance in prior years and forward-   \nlooking performance-vested compensation.

For stock unit awards \ngranted in 2021 and 2022, the Firm utilized   \nabove target performance as the probable      \noutcome of the performance conditions for     \nPSUs. The following table lists the aggregate \ngrant date fair value of stock unit awards    \ngranted to the NEOs during 2023. The aggregate\ngrant date fair value of 2022 RSUs and Staking\nAward RSUs included in the table is based on  \nthe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of   \nthe Firm\u2019s common stock on the grant date, and\nthe aggregate grant date fair value of 2023   \nPSUs and Staking Award PSUs included in the   \ntable is based on the VWAP of the Firm\u2019s      \ncommon stock on the grant date and the        \nprobable outcome of the performance conditions\nas of the grant date. For purposes of this    \nproxy statement, the probable outcome of the  \nperformance conditions as of the grant date   \nfor 2023 PSUs and Staking Award PSUs is the   \nachievement of the target level of performance\nconditions. Based on actual Firm performance, \nparticipants can earn up to a maximum of 1.5  \ntimes the target number of 2023 PSUs and      \nStaking Award PSUs granted, and as few as zero\nof the 2023 PSUs and Staking Award PSUs       \ngranted. The value of 2023 PSUs on the grant  \ndate, assuming that the highest level of      \nperformance conditions will be achieved and   \nthe maximum of 1.5 times the target number of \nunits will be earned, is: $27,000,000 for Mr. \nGorman; $3,375,000 for Ms. Yeshaya;           \n$11,812,500 for Mr. Pick; $10,237,500 for Mr. \nSaperstein; and $6,375,000 for Mr. Simkowitz. \nThe value of Staking Award PSUs on the grant  \ndate, assuming that the highest level of      \nperformance conditions will be achieved and   \nthe maximum of 1.5 times the target number of \nunits will be earned, is: $18,000,000 for each\nof Messrs.

Effective after December 31, 2010, the  \nERP was frozen and no further benefit accruals\nhave occurred or will occur. Benefits are     \ngenerally payable as an annuity at age 65 (or \nearlier, subject to certain reductions in the \namounts payable). Under the pre-2004          \nprovisions of the ERP, benefits are payable in\nfull at age 60 and reduced 4% per year for    \nretirement between ages 55 and 60 for         \nemployees who retire after age 55 with 10     \nyears of service.

PRE-  \nTAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM (PTIP) Under PTIP,      \nparticipants were permitted to defer a portion\nof their cash bonus or commissions for one or \nmore fiscal years. The plan has been closed to\nnew contributions since 2003. Earnings on PTIP\ncontributions are based on the performance of \nnotional investments available under the plan \nand selected by the participants.

The RSUs included in this table are  \nconsidered vested; however, the RSUs are      \nsubject to cancellation and clawback if a     \ncancellation or clawback event occurs at any  \ntime prior to the scheduled conversion date.  \nThe cancellation and clawback events          \napplicable to RSUs held by our NEOs are       \ndescribed in the CD&A and in \u201cPotential       \nPayments upon Termination or Change in        \nControl.\u201d Potential Payments upon Termination \nor Change in Control This section describes   \nand quantifies the benefits and compensation  \nto which each NEO would have been entitled    \nunder our existing plans and arrangements if  \nthe NEO\u2019s employment had terminated or if the \nFirm had undergone a change in control, in    \neach case on December 31, 2023. GENERAL       \nPOLICIES No Special Severance Payments Our    \nNEOs would be entitled to a cash severance    \npayment under the broad-based Morgan Stanley  \nSeverance Pay Plan (Severance Plan) in        \nconnection with an involuntary termination of \nemployment other than for cause, subject to   \nthe NEO executing a release agreement in a    \nform satisfactory to the Firm, on the same    \nbasis as all other employees. The NEOs are not\nentitled to any additional or enhanced cash   \nseverance payments upon any termination of    \nemployment under the Severance Plan or        \notherwise, or to excise tax protection upon a \nchange in control of the Firm. No Enhanced    \nTermination Payments or Benefits NEOs are     \nentitled to receive post-termination benefits \nthat are generally available to all salaried  \nemployees, such as death, disability and post-\nretirement welfare benefits, and are eligible \nfor Firm-paid retiree medical coverage under  \nthe Morgan Stanley Retiree Medical Plan for   \nthemselves and eligible dependents following  \nany termination of employment with three years\nof service. Following termination of          \nemployment, the NEOs are also entitled to     \namounts, to the extent vested, due under the  \nterms of our pension arrangements, as         \ndescribed under \u201c2023 Pension Benefits,\u201d and  \nour nonqualified deferred compensation plans, \nas described under \u201c2023 Nonqualified Deferred\nCompensation.\u201d Our NEOs are not entitled to   \nspecial or enhanced termination benefits under\nour pension and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation plans as compared to other       \nemployees. Cancellation and Clawback of       \nDeferred Compensation and Incentive-Based     \nCompensation Even if an NEO is considered     \nvested in a deferred incentive compensation   \naward, the award may be subject to            \ncancellation through the distribution date in \nthe event the NEO engages in a cancellation   \nevent or if a clawback event occurs. In       \ngeneral, a cancellation event includes:       \nengaging in competitive activity during a     \nspecified period following a voluntary        \ntermination of employment; engaging in cause  \n(i.e., a breach of the NEO\u2019s obligation to the\nFirm, including a failure to comply with      \ninternal compliance, ethics or risk management\nstandards and failure or refusal to perform   \nduties satisfactorily, including supervisory  \nand management duties); improper disclosure of\nthe Firm\u2019s proprietary information;           \nsolicitation of Firm employees, clients or    \ncustomers during, and within a specified      \nperiod following termination of, employment;  \nthe making of unauthorized disclosures or     \ndisparaging or defamatory comments about the  \nFirm; resignation from employment without     \nproviding the Firm proper advance notice; or  \nthe failure to cooperate with or assist the   \nFirm in connection with investigations,       \nregulatory matters, lawsuits or arbitrations  \nfollowing termination of employment. Clawback \nof deferred compensation awards by the Firm   \ncan be triggered through the applicable       \nscheduled distribution date if the NEO had    \nsignificant responsibility for a material     \nadverse outcome for the Firm or any of its    \nbusinesses or functions, even absent          \nmisconduct, or if the NEO\u2019s act or omission   \n(including with respect to direct supervisory \nresponsibilities) causes a restatement of the \nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial results,        \nviolates the Firm\u2019s                           \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT99  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nglobal risk management principles, policies   \nand standards, or causes a loss of revenue    \nassociated with a position for which the NEO  \nwas paid, and the NEO operated outside of     \ninternal control policies. Further, shares    \nresulting from the conversion of PSUs are     \nsubject to clawback by the Firm in the event  \nthe Firm\u2019s achievement of the specified goals \nwas based on materially inaccurate financial  \nstatements or other performance metric        \ncriteria. In addition, 2023 PSUs, Staking     \nAward PSUs, and other incentive-based         \ncompensation are subject to repayment under   \nthe Morgan Stanley Compensation Recoupment    \nPolicy if excess amounts are delivered based  \non a financial statement that was later       \nrequired to be restated due to a restatement  \n(without regard to fault or misconduct) within\nthe three fiscal years preceding the date the \nrestatement was required. Notice and Non-     \nSolicitation Agreements In addition to the    \ncancellation and clawback events described    \nabove, each NEO is party to a Notice and Non- \nSolicitation Agreement that provides for      \ninjunctive relief and cancellation of deferred\ncompensation awards if the NEO does not       \nprovide 180 days\u2019 advance notice prior to a   \nresignation or if the NEO improperly solicits \nthe Firm\u2019s employees, clients or customers at \nany time during employment or the 180 days    \nfollowing termination of employment.          \n                                          \n  100MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nTERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT / CHANGE IN CONTROL \nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31,\n2023, the value of the outstanding unvested   \ndeferred compensation awards held by the NEOs,\ncash severance entitlements, and the present  \nvalue of coverage under the Morgan Stanley    \nRetiree Medical Plan.

Because SEC rules\nfor identifying the median compensated        \nemployee for purposes of this disclosure allow\ncompanies to adopt various methodologies and  \nutilize various assumptions, the ratio        \nreported by other companies may not be        \ncomparable to the ratio reported by the Firm. \nFor 2023, our last completed fiscal year, the \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nemployees of the Firm (other than the CEO) was\n$136,515 and the annual total compensation of \nour CEO, as reported in the \u201c2023 Summary     \nCompensation Table,\u201d was $32,951,606. Based on\nthis information, for 2023, the ratio of the  \nannual total compensation of the CEO to the   \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nother employees of the Firm was 241 to 1. To  \nidentify the median of the annual total       \ncompensation of all employees of the Firm, we \ntook the following steps:                     \n                                              \n      We measured the employee population of  \n      the Firm as of December\u00a031, 2023, and   \n      included all employees of Morgan        \n      Stanley and its consolidated            \n      subsidiaries globally.

Annual total reward   \n      consists of fixed compensation (e.g.,   \n      base salary and allowances) and annual  \n  2.  incentive compensation delivered in     \n      cash or equity and other variable       \n      compensation analogous to annual        \n      incentive compensation (e.g.,           \n      commissions).

A detailed \ndiscussion of the CMDS Committee\u2019s decisions  \nregarding the compensation awarded to the NEOs\nfor 2023 performance can be found in the CD&A.\nPvP TABLE Pursuant to SEC rules, the PvP Table\nis required to include for each year          \n\u201cCompensation Actually Paid\u201d (CAP) to the CEO \nand the average CAP to the non-CEO NEOs. CAP  \nis an SEC defined term that represents a      \ncalculation of compensation that differs from \ncompensation paid during the year, the Summary\nCompensation Table (SCT) calculation of       \ncompensation (as detailed in footnote 1 of    \nthis PvP Table), and the way in which the CMDS\nCommittee views annual compensation decisions \n(as discussed in Section 4.1 of the CD&A). For\nexample, the CAP calculation for a given year \nincludes the change in fair value of multiple \nyears of equity grants that are outstanding   \nand unvested during the year, or which vested \nduring the year, whereas the SCT calculation  \nincludes only the fair value of equity awards \ngranted during the year. The CAP calculation  \nalso includes the value of dividend           \nequivalents accumulated on unvested equity    \nawards, whereas the SCT calculation does not. \nThese differences result in a CAP calculation \nthat is significantly impacted by changes in  \nstock price and other projected performance   \nresults and may be significantly higher or    \nlower than the corresponding SCT calculation. \nIt is also important to note that outstanding \nequity awards may be represented in more than \none year of the table, as demonstrated in the \nsupplemental table to footnote 1 to the PvP   \nTable. Equity grants (RSU and PSUs) constitute\na meaningful portion of compensation for the  \nCEO and other NEOs. The value of equity grants\nwill not be realized before the scheduled     \npayment date (generally three years from      \ngrant) and the ultimate value of such awards  \nis subject to changes in stock price. PSUs are\nfurther subject to the results of             \npredetermined three-year performance          \nobjectives. PSUs are earned based on          \nperformance against predetermined Firm goals. \nWhile each participant was awarded a target   \nnumber of PSUs, the actual number of PSUs     \nearned could vary from zero up to 1.5 times   \ntarget, if performance objectives are         \nmeaningfully exceeded, and no participant will\nreceive any portion of the PSUs if the        \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \n(For a summary of historical PSU performance, \nsee Section 4.3 of the CD&A.) In addition,    \nequity awards are subject to cancellation upon\ncertain events before they convert to shares  \nof Morgan Stanley common stock. The CEO and   \nother NEOs are also subject to an Equity      \nOwnership Commitment and are not able to sell,\ntransfer or otherwise dispose of all of the   \nshares of Firm common stock received upon     \nconversion of equity awards (see \u201cOwnership of\nOur Stock\u2013Executive Equity Ownership          \nCommitment\u201d).                                 \n

The Firm\u2019s     \nstrategic acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton   \nVance, as well as the achievement of other    \nlong-term strategic objectives led by the CEO \nand the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee, of which  \nthe NEOs are a part, were significant         \ncontributors to the Firm\u2019s stock price        \noutperformance. Year-over-year changes to the \nCAP to CEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs\nbetween 2020 and 2021, 2021 and 2022 and,     \nexcluding the Staking Awards for the Average  \nCAP to Non-CEO NEOs, 2022 and 2023 generally  \ncorrelate to changes in the Firm\u2019s cumulative \nTSR (as calculated pursuant to SEC rules for  \nthe PvP table), Net Income and ROTCE for the  \nsame periods. The Firm delivered strong Net   \nIncome and ROTCE, and significant stock       \nappreciation and returns to shareholders, over\nthese periods. The table below shows that CEO \nand Average Non-CEO NEO compensation (as      \nreported in SCT) changes were in line with    \nchanges in the Firm\u2019s Net Income and ROTCE,   \nwhile changes in the value of the CAP to CEO  \nand the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs were      \nimpacted by the following factors: dividends, \nchange in pension value, and changes in fair  \nvalue of equity awards (e.g., due to          \nperformance conditions of performance-based   \nequity and share price).                      \n                                          \n  106MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                \n  (1)  As reported in the SCT.  \n                                \n                                              \n       For 2021, also includes multiple RSU   \n  (2)  awards for one NEO that vested in      \n       2021 due to achieving FCR              \n       eligibility.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  (3)  Value of initial fixed $100            \n       investment.                            \n                                              \nThe correlation between changes in the CAP to \nCEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs and   \nchanges in the Firm\u2019s cumulative TSR and ROTCE\nfor the periods shown in the table is due     \nprimarily to the Firm\u2019s use of equity         \nincentives that are directly tied to stock    \nprice and, in particular, PSUs that are also  \ndirectly tied to Firm financial performance   \nand constitute a significant portion of       \nincentive compensation for the CEO (60% for   \n2023) and non-CEO NEOs (30% on average for    \n2023 excluding Staking Awards). Because       \nStaking Awards are equity-based (60% PSUs and \n40% RSUs), they will impact the Average CAP to\nNon-CEO NEOs for each year of the 3-year      \nvesting period and their value will fluctuate \nwith Firm stock price and ROTCE performance.  \nBecause the PSUs are equity-based, increases  \nin Firm stock price result in increases in TSR\nand increases in CAP values and decreases in  \nFirm stock price result in decreases in TSR   \nand decreases in CAP values. Unlike PSUs, RSUs\n(with the exception of the Staking Award RSUs,\nwhich do not contain a provision for vesting  \nupon FCR eligibility) do not significantly    \ninfluence the correlations shown in the above \ntable because, pursuant to SEC rules, the CAP \ncalculations for the fair value of unvested   \nRSU awards are generally fixed at the grant   \ndate fair value of the awards at the beginning\nof each year due to FCR eligibility under the \naward terms and deemed vested at grant.       \nChanges in fair value for the Staking Award   \nRSUs due to fluctuations in the share price   \nwill, however, be reflected in the CAP        \namounts. The Firm\u2019s ROTCE is a performance    \npriority that is used as a factor in          \ndetermining incentive compensation for the CEO\nand Non-CEO NEOs. The Firm does not use Net   \nIncome to determine compensation levels or PSU\npayouts.                                      \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT107  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nCommitment to Equitable Compensation Practices\nAttracting, retaining and advancing under-    \nrepresented talent is a priority for the Firm,\nand a key aspect to this is ensuring that     \nwomen and all other under-represented groups  \nare rewarded equitably. Morgan Stanley has    \nrobust compensation practices that help ensure\nthat compensation and reward decisions are    \nmade fairly and consistently and are based on \nan individual\u2019s role, performance and         \nexperience. The Firm reviews compensation     \ndecisions for employees on an ongoing basis,  \nincluding at the point of hire as well as     \nduring our annual compensation process, to    \nhelp ensure that individual compensation      \ndecisions are in line with this philosophy. A \ndiverse workforce is key to our success, and  \nconsistent with that, we are committed to     \ncontinually assessing our rewards structure   \nand decisions to help ensure equity in pay for\nall employees.                                \n                                          \n  108MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOwnership of Our Stock Executive Equity       \nOwnership Commitment Members of the Firm\u2019s    \nOperating Committee and executive officers are\nsubject to an Equity Ownership Commitment. The\nEquity Ownership Commitment requires each of  \nour CEO, CFO and Co-Presidents (collectively, \nCovered Officers) to achieve ownership of a   \nnumber of shares of common stock and equity   \nawards with a value equal to a specified      \nmultiple of his or her base salary within five\nyears. Our CEO is required to achieve         \nownership of shares of common stock and equity\nawards with a value equal to 10 times his base\nsalary and each other Covered Officer is      \nrequired to achieve ownership of shares of    \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to six times his or her base salary. In \naddition, Operating Committee members         \n(including all executive officers) are        \nrequired to retain common stock and equity    \nawards equal to a percentage of common stock  \nreceived from equity awards (less allowances  \nfor the payment of any option exercise price  \nand taxes) granted to them for service on the \nOperating Committee (Equity Award Shares, and \nsuch service, Covered Service) as follows:    \n                                              \n     Our CEO is required to retain 75% of     \n     Equity Award Shares acquired pursuant    \n     to equity awards granted in respect of   \n     any performance year prior to and        \n  \u2022  including the fifth year of Covered      \n     Service as CEO and 50% of Equity Award   \n     Shares acquired pursuant to equity       \n     awards granted in respect of any         \n     performance year following the fifth     \n     year of Covered Service as CEO.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each of our other Operating Committee    \n     members and executive officers is        \n     required to retain 50% of Equity Award   \n     Shares acquired from equity awards       \n     granted in respect of any performance    \n     year prior to and including the fifth    \n     year of Covered Service and 33% of       \n  \u2022  Equity Award Shares acquired pursuant    \n     to equity awards granted in respect of   \n     any performance year following the       \n     fifth year of Covered Service; provided  \n     that Operating Committee members who     \n     are Covered Officers must retain 75% of  \n     all Equity Award Shares until the        \n     applicable ownership requirement is      \n     met.                                     \n                                              \nThis commitment ties a portion of our         \nOperating Committee members\u2019 net worth to the \nFirm\u2019s stock price and provides a continuing  \nincentive for them to work toward superior    \nlong-term stock price performance. Exceptions \nto the Equity Ownership Commitment are subject\nto the approval of the CMDS Committee. None of\nour executive officers currently have         \nprearranged trading plans under SEC Rule      \n10b5-1. Shares counted for purposes of the    \nEquity Ownership Commitment include shares    \nowned (including shares held in trust) by the \nexecutive or the executive\u2019s spouse or        \ndependent children, shares (or share          \nequivalents) held in the Firm\u2019s 401(k) Plan   \nand net shares granted with respect to RSUs   \n(including PSUs) after assumed tax            \nwithholding. Unearned PSUs are not counted for\npurposes of the stock ownership requirement.  \nEach Operating Committee member is in         \ncompliance with the requirements of the Equity\nOwnership Commitment. Director Equity         \nOwnership Requirement Our Corporate Governance\nPolicies require each independent director to \nretain ownership of a number of shares of     \nMorgan Stanley common stock and equity awards \nwith a value equal to five times the annual   \ncash Board retainer, and to retain 100% of his\nor her Morgan Stanley stock unit awards (on an\nafter-tax basis) until such ownership         \nrequirement is met. In addition, as discussed \nunder \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d our independent\ndirectors generally receive an equity award   \nupon initial election to the Board and receive\nan annual equity award thereafter with a grant\ndate fair value of $260,000 (prorated in the  \ncase of the initial award) as part of their   \ndirector compensation. Fifty percent of each  \nequity award granted to our independent       \ndirectors does not become payable until the   \ndirector retires from the Board (and may be   \ndeferred beyond retirement at the director\u2019s  \nelection). We believe that these equity       \nownership opportunities and requirements      \nenhance the alignment of independent          \ndirectors\u2019 interests with the long-term       \ninterests of our shareholders.                \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT109  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Ownership of Our Stock  \n                          \nProhibition Against Pledging and Hedging Firm \npolicy prohibits directors, officers as       \ndefined by Section 16 of the Securities       \nExchange Act of 1934, including the Firm\u2019s    \nexecutive officers, and other members of the  \nFirm\u2019s Operating Committee from pledging,     \nselling short, engaging in hedging strategies \nor trading derivatives involving Morgan       \nStanley securities, including securities      \ngranted in connection with compensation or    \notherwise held.

The NQ \nESPP provides an opportunity for employees of \neligible non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm to \npurchase shares of Firm common stock at a     \ndiscount. The NQ ESPP is not intended to be   \ntax qualified under Section 423 of the        \nInternal Revenue Code (Section 423). The Firm \nalso has an employee stock purchase plan that \nis tax qualified under Section 423 (Qualified \nESPP). The Qualified ESPP is for employees of \neligible U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm. The   \nQualified ESPP was approved by shareholders in\n1994. Due to tax, administrative and other    \nhurdles, it is not feasible to implement the  \nQualified ESPP for employees of certain       \nnon-U.S. subsidiaries. If approved, the       \nmaximum aggregate number of shares that may be\npurchased under the NQ ESPP will be 5,000,000,\nwhich shares will be reallocated and deducted \nfrom the share reserve of the Qualified ESPP  \nthat was previously approved by shareholders. \nAs such, the adoption of the NQ ESPP will not \nincrease the number of shares available for   \nissuance in connection with our employee stock\npurchase programs and will not result in      \nincremental dilution to shareholders. The     \nBoard believes that approval of the NQ ESPP is\nin the best interests of shareholders and     \nsupports this proposal for the following      \nreasons:                                      \n                                              \n     The NQ ESPP provides employees of        \n     eligible non-U.S. subsidiaries with the  \n  \u2022  opportunity that employees of eligible   \n     U.S. subsidiaries have under the         \n     Qualified ESPP to acquire an ownership   \n     interest in the Firm.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Providing eligible employees with an     \n     opportunity to acquire an ownership      \n  \u2022  interest in the Firm is important to     \n     the Firm\u2019s ability to attract and        \n     retain high-quality, high-performing     \n     employees.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Ownership of shares of Firm common       \n     stock aligns the interests of employees  \n  \u2022  and shareholders, and motivates          \n     employees to contribute to the           \n     achievement of Firm objectives.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Because we are not requesting            \n     additional shares for the NQ ESPP, and   \n  \u2022  are instead reallocating shares from     \n     the Qualified ESPP, the NQ ESPP will     \n     not result in incremental dilution to    \n     shareholders.                            \n                                              \nOur Board unanimously recommends that you vote\n\u201cFOR\u201d this proposal. Proxies solicited by the \nBoard will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d this proposal unless\notherwise instructed. Summary of the NQ ESPP A\ncopy of the NQ ESPP is attached to this proxy \nstatement as Annex A and the following summary\nis qualified in its entirety by reference     \nthereto. The capitalized terms not otherwise  \ndefined in this summary have the meaning      \nassigned to them in the NQ ESPP. PURPOSE AND  \nELIGIBILITY The purpose of the NQ ESPP is to  \nsecure for the Firm and its shareholders the  \nbenefits of the incentive inherent in the     \nownership of Firm common stock by current and \nfuture employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries of  \nthe Firm by providing them with the           \nopportunity to purchase shares at a discount  \nthrough voluntary contributions from eligible \npay. As of March 25, 2024, approximately      \n12,691 employees would be eligible to         \nparticipate in the NQ                         \n                                          \n  112MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \nESPP. The basis for participation in the NQ   \nESPP is the administrator\u2019s determination, in \nits discretion, that the individual\u2019s employer\nshall be a participating subsidiary under the \nNQ ESPP. In exercising its discretion, the    \nadministrator will consider the purposes of   \nthe NQ ESPP and such other factors it deems   \nrelevant. EFFECTIVE DATE If approved by       \nshareholders, the NQ ESPP will become         \neffective on May 23, 2024. The NQ ESPP will   \ncontinue until terminated by the Board or the \ndate that all shares available for issuance   \nunder the NQ ESPP have been issued. SHARES    \nRESERVED The aggregate number of shares of    \nFirm common stock that may be issued under the\nNQ ESPP may not exceed 5,000,000 shares.      \nShares subject to the NQ ESPP may be          \nauthorized but unissued, treasury shares, or  \nboth. The number of shares issuable under the \nNQ ESPP and the terms of purchase rights to   \nacquire such shares are subject to adjustment \nas described below. The shares available for  \nissuance under the NQ ESPP will be allocated  \nfrom shares previously authorized under the   \nQualified ESPP. As of March 25, 2024, there   \nwere 36,555,600 shares of Company common stock\nremaining allocated for issuance under the    \nQualified ESPP. ADMINISTRATION The NQ ESPP    \nwill be administered by the Board. Subject to \nthe express provisions of the NQ ESPP, the    \nBoard has the authority to interpret the NQ   \nESPP, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules   \nand regulations relating to it, and to make   \nall other determinations necessary or         \nadvisable in administering the NQ ESPP, all of\nwhich determinations are final, binding and   \nconclusive. The Board may, to the extent      \npermitted by law, delegate any of its         \nauthority to administer the NQ ESPP to one or \nmore officers of the Firm or to a committee   \n(which may be a committee of the Board, or a  \ncommittee comprised solely of officers of the \nFirm). ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPATION An        \neligible employee may elect to participate in \nthe NQ ESPP by completing a Firm-specified    \nprocess. Participation in the NQ ESPP is      \nvoluntary. When enrolling, the eligible       \nemployee shall specify a payroll deduction    \namount of a percentage of eligible            \ncompensation, which shall be withheld from    \nsuch employee\u2019s regular paychecks for the     \noffering period. The administrator may        \ndetermine and specify, from time to time, (i) \nthe range of permissible percentages of       \neligible compensation an eligible employee may\nspecify to be withheld and (ii) the maximum   \namount of eligible compensation that may be   \ndeducted for an eligible employee in any plan \nyear. As of the date hereof, it is anticipated\nthat participating employees will be permitted\nto contribute up to 25% of their eligible     \ncompensation to the NQ ESPP. Eligible         \ncompensation means an eligible employee\u2019s base\nsalary unless otherwise determined by the     \nadministrator. Eligible compensation may vary \nby location. Contributions are made on an     \nafter-tax basis. No option under the NQ ESPP  \nmay permit an eligible employee to purchase   \nshares of Firm common stock under all employee\nstock purchase plans (other than the Morgan   \nStanley United Kingdom Stock Ownership Plan)  \nin an amount that, in the aggregate, would    \nhave a fair market value in excess of         \nUS$25,000 for each calendar year in which such\noption is outstanding. In addition, no option \nunder the NQ ESPP may give any participant the\nright to purchase more than 1,000 shares      \nduring any offering period. PARTICIPATION     \nCHANGES AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT Any     \nparticipant may change his or her             \nparticipation in the NQ ESPP by completing a  \nFirm-specified process. The change will become\neffective on the first day of the first pay   \nperiod following the completion of such       \nprocess to which it may be practically        \napplied. A participant who ceases             \nparticipation in the NQ ESPP will be eligible \nto participate again in the NQ ESPP by        \ncompleting a Firm-specified process (provided \nthat he or she is otherwise an eligible       \nemployee at such later time). If the          \nemployment of a participant terminates for any\nreason, then his or her participation in the  \nNQ ESPP will terminate automatically as of the\ndate of such termination of employment. All   \namounts in the participant\u2019s payroll          \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT113  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \ndeduction account accumulated during the      \noffering period during which such termination \noccurs will be refunded to the participant as \nsoon as administratively practicable. On      \ntermination of employment (except in the case \nof death), shares are subject to the 12-month \ntransfer restriction noted below; however,    \nshares purchased through the NQ ESPP may be   \nsold without regard to the 12-month no sale   \nperiod noted below. OFFERING PERIOD The NQ    \nESPP provides for monthly offering periods    \nbeginning on the day following a purchase date\nand continuing through the following purchase \ndate. PURCHASE PRICE; PURCHASE DATE The price \nper share at which shares are purchased under \nthe NQ ESPP will be expressed as a percentage \nof the fair market value of the Company common\nstock on the purchase date, as determined by  \nthe Board, but in no event will be less than  \n85% of the fair market value of the Firm      \ncommon stock on the purchase date, or if the  \ncommon stock was not traded on the purchase   \ndate, the immediately following date on which \nthe common stock was traded. The purchase date\nis the second day of each month unless        \notherwise determined by the administrator.    \nHOLDING PERIOD The shares purchased under the \nNQ ESPP cannot be sold or transferred for a   \nperiod of 12-months from the first day of the \noffering period in connection with which such \nshares were purchased. Sales and transfers    \nmust comply with securities laws and the      \nFirm\u2019s trading policies. DIVIDENDS ON SHARES A\nparticipant may elect to have all cash        \ndividends paid with respect to shares of      \nCompany common stock held in the participant\u2019s\naccount invested automatically in shares of   \nCompany common stock purchased at 100% of fair\nmarket value on the date such dividend is     \npaid. ADJUSTMENTS In the event of a           \nsubdivision or consolidation of the           \noutstanding shares of Firm common stock, or   \nthe payment of a stock dividend on the shares,\nthe number of shares reserved or authorized to\nbe reserved under the NQ ESPP will be         \nincreased or decreased, as the case may be,   \nequitably by the Board. In the event of any   \nother change affecting the Firm common stock, \nsuch adjustments will be made equitably by the\nBoard to give proper effect to such event and \nwill be subject to applicable law.            \nTRANSFERABILITY Rights to purchase shares     \nunder the NQ ESPP may not be transferred,     \npledged or otherwise disposed of in any way   \n(other than by will or the laws of descent and\ndistribution) by a participant and may be     \nexercised during a participant\u2019s lifetime only\nby the participant. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE\nLAWS The Firm\u2019s obligation to offer, issue,   \nsell or deliver shares under the NQ ESPP is at\nall times subject to all approvals of and     \ncompliance with any governmental authorities  \n(whether domestic or foreign) required in     \nconnection with the authorization, offer,     \nissuance, sale or delivery of shares as well  \nas all federal, state, local and foreign laws \nor as otherwise required under applicable     \nstock exchange rules and regulations.         \nAMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Board (or its   \ndelegate as allowed under the terms of the NQ \nESPP and applicable law) may amend or         \nterminate the NQ ESPP in any respect at any   \ntime; provided, however, that the NQ ESPP may \nnot be amended in a manner that will          \nretroactively impair or otherwise adversely   \naffect the rights of any person to benefits   \nunder the NQ ESPP which have accrued prior to \nthe date of such action. The NQ ESPP will also\nterminate on the purchase date that           \nparticipants become entitled to purchase      \nshares of Firm common stock greater than the  \nnumber of shares remaining available for      \npurchase.                                     \n                                          \n  114MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \nFEDERAL INCOME TAXATION The following is a    \ngeneral summary under current law of certain  \nU.S. federal income tax consequences to       \nparticipants who are citizens or individual   \nresidents of the United States relating to    \nparticipation in the NQ ESPP. This summary    \ndeals with the general tax principles that    \napply to participation in the NQ ESPP and is  \nprovided only for general information. Certain\nkinds of taxes, such as foreign taxes, state  \nand local income taxes, payroll taxes and the \nalternative minimum tax, are not discussed.   \nBecause circumstances may vary, we advise     \nparticipants to consult their own tax advisors\nunder all circumstances. As noted above, only \nemployees of certain of the Company\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries will be eligible to participate  \nin the NQ ESPP. The NQ ESPP is not intended to\nqualify as an employee stock purchase plan    \nwithin the meaning of Section 423. The NQ ESPP\nis also not intended to qualify under Section \n401 of the Internal Revenue Code and is not   \nsubject to the requirements of the Employee   \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, as    \namended. All shares purchased under the NQ    \nESPP will be purchased by the participants    \nwith after-tax income. Under the Internal     \nRevenue Code as currently in effect, a        \nparticipant in the NQ ESPP will not recognize \nincome on the grant of an option, nor will the\nCompany be entitled to a deduction at that    \ntime. Upon the participant\u2019s purchase of      \nCompany common stock under the NQ ESPP, the   \nparticipant will recognize income, and the    \nCompany will generally be entitled to a       \ncorresponding deduction. The amount of income \nrecognized, and the Company\u2019s corresponding   \ntax deduction, will be equal to the difference\nbetween the purchase price paid for the stock \nand the fair market value of Company common   \nstock on the purchase date. When the          \nparticipant sells any shares purchased under  \nthe NQ ESPP, the participant will have capital\ngain or loss equal to the difference, if any, \nbetween the proceeds of the sale and the      \nparticipant\u2019s basis in the common stock (the  \npurchase price plus any ordinary income       \nrealized). The capital gain rate will depend  \non how long the common stock was held by the  \nparticipant. No deductions will be available  \nto the Company in connection with the         \ndisposition of shares of Company common stock \npurchased under the NQ ESPP. All purchases of \nstock under the NQ ESPP by employees are      \nsubject to applicable withholding             \nrequirements. NEW PLAN BENEFITS Because       \nbenefits under the NQ ESPP depend on          \nemployees\u2019 elections to participate in the NQ \nESPP and the fair market value of the shares  \nof Company common stock at various future     \ndates, it is not possible to determine future \nbenefits that will be received by executive   \nofficers and other employees under the NQ     \nESPP. Our current executive officers, each of \nwhom is employed by a U.S. subsidiary, and our\nnon-employee directors are not eligible to    \nparticipate in the NQ ESPP.

Proponent\u2019s Statement Report on Risks\nof Politicized De-banking Supporting          \nStatement: Financial institutions are         \nessential pillars of the marketplace. On      \naccount of their unique and pivotal role in   \nAmerica\u2019s economy, many federal and state laws\nalready prohibit them from discriminating     \nagainst customers. And the UN Declaration of  \nHuman Rights recognizes that \u201ceveryone has the\nright to freedom of thought, conscience, and  \nreligion.\u201d 1These are an important part of    \nprotecting every American\u2019s right to free     \nspeech and free exercise of religion. As      \nshareholders of Morgan Stanley, we believe it \nis essential for the company to provide       \nfinancial services on an equal basis without  \nregard to factors such as race, color,        \nreligion, sex, national origin, or social,    \npolitical, or religious views. We are         \nconcerned with recent evidence of religious   \nand political discrimination against customers\nby companies in the financial services        \nindustry, as seen in recent examples 2and the \n2022 Statement on Debanking and Free Speech. 3\nThe 2023 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity   \nBusiness Index 4shows that many of the largest\nfinancial institutions include vague and      \nsubjective grounds to deny service like       \n\u201creputational risk,\u201d \u201csocial risk,\u201d           \n\u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201chate speech\u201d or            \n\u201cintolerance.\u201d These kinds of terms allow     \nfinancial institutions to deny or restrict    \nservice for arbitrary or discriminatory       \nreasons. They also give fringe activists and  \ngovernments a foothold to demand that private \nfinancial institutions deny service under the \nsweeping, unfettered discretion that such     \npolicies provide.                             \n                                              \n  1  https://www.un.org/en/about-us/univers\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n     https://adflegal.org/press-release/ban\u2026  \n     https://www.newsweek.com/stop-troublin\u2026  \n  2  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/artic\u2026  \n     used-tweet-Ricky-Gervais-trans-joke-No\u2026  \n     https://familycouncil.org/?p=25159       \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://storage.googleapis.com/vds_sto\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://viewpointdiversityscore.org/bu\u2026  \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT117  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                         \n  Shareholder Proposals  \n                         \nWhen companies engage in this kind of         \ndiscrimination, they hinder the ability of    \nAmericans to access the marketplace and       \ninstead become de factoregulators and censors.\nThis undermines the fundamental freedoms of   \nour country and is an affront to the public   \ntrust. Politicized debanking can also damage  \nthe company\u2019s reputation and ability to       \noperate in favorable regulatory environments. \nIn early 2023, shareholders called for Chase, \nMastercard, PayPal, Capital One, and Charles  \nSchwab to assess whether they have adequate   \nsafeguards to prevent politicized de-banking. \n5Nineteen state attorneys general and fourteen\nstate financial officers specifically called  \nout Chase for their de-banking of a non-profit\ncommitted to advancing religious freedom and  \ndemanded action from the company to show good \nfaith in addressing these widespread concerns.\n6 Resolved : Shareholders request the Board of\nDirectors of Morgan Stanley conduct an        \nevaluation and issue a report within the next \nyear, at reasonable cost and excluding        \nproprietary information and disclosure of     \nanything that would constitute an admission of\npending litigation, evaluating how it oversees\nrisks related to discrimination against       \nindividuals based on their race, color,       \nreligion (including religious views), sex,    \nnational origin, or political views, and      \nwhether such discrimination may impact        \nindividuals\u2019 exercise of their                \nconstitutionally protected civil rights.      \nStatement of the Board Recommending a Vote    \nAgainst this Proposal The Board believes that \nthis proposal is not in the best interest of  \nMorgan Stanley or its shareholders and opposes\nthis proposal for the reasons discussed below.\n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley agrees with the           \n     proponent that \u201cit is essential \u2026 to     \n     provide financial services on an equal   \n     basis without regard to factors such as  \n     race, color, religion, sex, national     \n     origin, or social, political, or         \n  \u2022  religious views.\u201d The proponent states   \n     that it has concerns \u201cwith recent        \n     evidence of religious and political      \n     discrimination against customers in the  \n     financial services industry,\u201d and cites  \n     recent examples; however, none of the    \n     examples cited involve Morgan Stanley.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley is committed to avoiding  \n     discrimination in the provision of       \n     financial services on the basis of       \n     race, religion, or any other protected   \n     status or political views.We follow      \n  \u2022  established processes when engaging      \n     with clients to avoid arbitrary or       \n     discriminatory practices, and respect    \n     clients who represent a broad spectrum   \n     of different viewpoints. It is not our   \n     policy to debank clients solely because  \n     of their viewpoints.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     We do not make decisions about client    \n     engagements and financings based on a    \n     client\u2019s race, color, religion           \n     (including religious views), sex, or     \n     national origin.

Morgan     \nStanley spent $37 million from 2010 \u2013 2022 on \nfederal lobbying. This does not include state \nlobbying, where Morgan Stanley also lobbies.  \nMorgan Stanley also lobbies abroad, spending  \nbetween \u20ac600,000 \u2013 699,999 on lobbying in     \nEurope for 2022. Companies can give unlimited \namounts to third party groups that spend      \nmillions on lobbying and undisclosed          \ngrassroots activity. 13Morgan Stanley fails to\ndisclose its payments to trade associations   \nand social welfare groups, or the amounts used\nfor lobbying, to shareholders. Morgan Stanley \ndiscloses membership in the American Bankers  \n                                              \n  13  https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/b\u2026  \n                                              \n                                          \n  120MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                         \n  Shareholder Proposals  \n                         \nAssociation (ABA), Bank Policy Institute      \n(BPI), Financial Services Forum (FSF),        \nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets     \nAssociation and US Chamber of Commerce, which \ntogether spent $101 million on federal        \nlobbying for 2022. Morgan Stanley\u2019s disclosure\nomits major trade association memberships,    \nlike the Business Roundtable and Managed Funds\nAssociation. Morgan Stanley\u2019s lack of         \ndisclosure presents reputational risks when   \nits lobbying contradicts company public       \npositions. For example, Morgan Stanley        \nsupports addressing climate change, yet the   \nBusiness Roundtable opposed the Inflation     \nReduction Act and its historic investments in \nclimate action, 14and BPI and FSF both lobbied\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to     \nweaken proposed climate disclosure rules. 15A \nrecent analysis looking at inconsistencies    \nbetween banks\u2019 public climate commitments and \ntheir direct and indirect climate lobbying    \npractices noted Morgan Stanley failed to      \npublicly support the Inflation Reduction Act. \n16And while Morgan Stanley does not belong to \nor support the controversial American         \nLegislative Exchange Council, 17one of its    \ntrade associations does, as ABA supported its \n2022 annual meeting. 18 Statement of the Board\nRecommending a Vote Against this Proposal The \nBoard believes that this proposal is not in   \nthe best interest of Morgan Stanley or its    \nshareholders and opposes this proposal for the\nreasons discussed below.                      \n                                              \n     We are committed to providing our        \n     shareholders with meaningful disclosure  \n     about our lobbying activities and trade  \n     association participation, as detailed   \n     below.The Morgan Stanley Corporate       \n  \u2022  Political Activities Policy Statement    \n     (Policy Statement), available on our     \n     website at                               \n     https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us\u2026  \n     and existing public disclosure already   \n     address the material items requested in  \n     this proposal.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our Policy Statement is designed to      \n     provide transparency with respect to     \n     the principles and procedures            \n  \u2022  concerning Morgan Stanley\u2019s political    \n     contributions, political action          \n     committee, lobbying activities and       \n     trade association participation.         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our Policy Statement is a key source of  \n     information for our shareholders and     \n     includes recent enhancements approved    \n     by the Governance and Sustainability     \n     Committee to further increase            \n     transparency with respect to our         \n     lobbying activities and consolidate our  \n  \u00b0  existing public disclosures, including   \n     our policies related to grassroots       \n     lobbying and organizations that write    \n     or endorse model legislation and         \n     disclosure regarding our average         \n     lobbying expenditures for the past       \n     three years and the aggregate dues       \n     attributable to lobbying by U.S. trade   \n     associations.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley does not make corporate   \n     contributions in the U.S. at the         \n     federal, state or local level to         \n     candidates, political party committees,  \n     ballot committees or political action    \n     committees even when permitted to do so  \n     by applicable law.

The disclosure,    \nprepared at reasonable expense and excluding  \nconfidential information, shall describe      \nCompany\u2019s methodology, including what it      \nclassifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d  \nSupporting Statement The Intergovernmental    \nPanel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d) has advised  \nthat greenhouse gas emissions must be halved  \nby 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. According \nto the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d),   \nthis requires rapid transition away from      \nfossil fuels and a tripling in global annual  \nclean energy investment by 2030. 19 Banks     \naligning their activities with their own      \nclimate goals are better prepared to manage   \nthe risks, including legal, reputational and  \nfinancial risks, associated with the global   \nenergy transition. Furthermore, they can      \ncapitalize on profitable opportunities in     \nclean energy and position themselves as       \nleaders in a rapidly changing market.

We believe that   \n  \u2022  the proposal\u2019s request to disclose the   \n     Ratio could draw attention away from     \n     our focus on emissions-based targets,    \n     that draw on industry standards, to a    \n     clean energy financing Ratio instead.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Unlike approaches to carbon accounting   \n     and reporting, where there is clear,     \n     globally harmonized guidance (e.g.,      \n     Partnership for Carbon Accounting        \n     Financials, and Task Force on            \n     Climate-Related Financial Disclosure     \n     (TCFD)), there is no standard or agreed  \n     upon way to determine the Ratio          \n     requested by the proposal. Disclosing    \n     the Ratio, even with discretion to       \n     calculate it in accordance with our own  \n     methodology, could potentially raise a   \n  \u00b0  number of questions, including whether   \n     our approach to the disclosure is        \n     similar to those of other companies      \n     that may also elect to disclose the      \n     Ratio. It is also possible that we are   \n     later asked by other stakeholders to     \n     have targets tied to the Ratio if we     \n     disclose it. As cited in the supporting  \n     statement to the proposal, an estimated  \n     Ratio calculated by Bloomberg is         \n     already publicly available. As such, if  \n     our Ratio is different, we may           \n     encounter criticism regarding our        \n     approach for the calculation.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     In our net-zero strategy, we have been   \n     intentional in helping to inform and     \n     leverage standardized frameworks and     \n     approaches, which helps enhance          \n     comparability. We believe this is in     \n     the best interest of our clients,        \n     shareholders and other stakeholders. We  \n     believe that the lack of a standardized  \n  \u00b0  method at this time makes it             \n     challenging to report a Ratio that       \n     would be meaningful as a way to compare  \n     companies. It is also unclear what the   \n     incremental value to shareholders would  \n     be of publishing an additional           \n     proprietary metric that may not be       \n     consistent with our net-zero strategy,   \n     nor comparable to other firms that may   \n     produce such a proprietary metric.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     We believe our existing targets and      \n     metrics properly incentivize Morgan      \n     Stanley to proactively work with our     \n     clients on climate transition            \n     opportunities, which we think is the     \n     most appropriate strategy for Morgan     \n  \u2022  Stanley, our clients, and our            \n     shareholders, as well as for addressing  \n     real-economy greenhouse emissions.       \n     Management needs flexibility to assist   \n     our clients with their transition plans  \n     as part of our overall net-zero          \n     strategy.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     We recognize that the path to achieving  \n     our 2030 interim targets will not        \n     always be linear and we accept that, in  \n  \u00b0  some cases, lending to companies that    \n     are transitioning may result in our      \n     financed emissions increasing in the     \n     short term or over certain periods.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Companies transitioning to more          \n     sustainable operations will require      \n     significant capital over a long period   \n     of time based on needs that are not      \n     foreseeable today.

Fossil-fuel clients that      \n  \u00b0  seek financial solutions to implement    \n     these changes present opportunities for  \n     partnership with us in multiple          \n     alternative ways that support the        \n     transition to a low-carbon economy, to   \n     the benefit of Morgan Stanley and our    \n     shareholders, as well as the climate.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Given that we already disclose financed  \n     emissions data related to our interim    \n     targets and will include enhanced        \n  \u2022  disclosures in our 2023 ESG Report, we   \n     do not believe that developing and       \n     calculating the proposed Ratio would be  \n     in the best interests of our clients or  \n     our shareholders.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Our 2023 ESG Report will continue to     \n  \u00b0  include a dedicated climate section      \n     that leverages guidance from the TCFD.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     We will also include additional          \n     disclosure in our 2023 ESG Report to     \n  \u00b0  provide more information on our CSAF,    \n     including progress made since our 2022   \n     ESG Report to further leverage the CSAF  \n     in our business activities.              \n                                              \n                                              \n     In addition, we will continue to report  \n  \u00b0  on progress towards our $1Tn             \n     sustainable finance target and the       \n     $750Bn low-carbon and green subset.      \n                                              \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board believes \nthat the disclosure of the Ratio could        \nultimately end up affecting management\u2019s      \ndiscretion in developing and managing our     \nstrategy to align our business with net-zero  \nby 2050, to the detriment of our clients,     \nshareholders and real-economy emissions       \nreductions.

In such   \n     case, if a director does not receive a   \n     majority of votes cast, the Board will   \n     make a determination to accept or        \n     reject the resignation and publicly      \n     disclose its decision within 90 days     \n     after the certification of the election  \n     results.                                 \n                                              \nIs My Vote Confidential? Our bylaws provide   \nthat your vote is confidential and will not be\ndisclosed to any officer, director or         \nemployee, except in certain limited           \ncircumstances such as when you request or     \nconsent to disclosure. Voting of the shares   \nheld in the 401(k) Plan also is confidential. \nHow Do I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares\nHeld Through a Broker? If you hold shares     \nthrough a broker, follow the voting           \ninstructions you receive from your broker. If \nyou do not submit voting instructions to your \nbroker, your broker may still be permitted to \nvote your shares in certain cases. NYSE member\nbrokers may vote your shares as described     \nbelow:                                        \n                                              \n     Non-discretionary Items. All items,      \n     other than the ratification of the       \n     appointment of Morgan Stanley\u2019s          \n     independent auditor, are                 \n     \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d items. It is         \n  \u2022  critically important that you submit     \n     your voting instructions if you want     \n     your shares to count for                 \n     non-discretionary items. Your shares     \n     will remain unvoted for such items if    \n     your NYSE member broker does not         \n     receive voting instructions from you.    \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT129  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                        \n  Information About the Annual Meeting  \n                                        \n                                              \n     Discretionary Item.

This results in a    \n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d for non-discretionary items.\nHow Do I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares\nHeld in My Name? If you hold shares as a      \nrecord shareholder, you may have your shares  \nvoted by submitting a proxy for your shares by\nmail, telephone or the Internet as described  \non the proxy card. If you submit your proxy   \nvia the Internet, you may incur Internet      \naccess charges. Submitting your proxy will not\nlimit your right to vote at the annual        \nmeeting. A properly completed and submitted   \nproxy will be voted in accordance with your   \ninstructions, unless you subsequently revoke  \nyour proxy in accordance with the procedures  \ndescribed below (see \u201cHow Can I Revoke My     \nProxy?\u201d). If you submit a signed proxy card   \nwithout indicating your voting instructions,  \nthe person voting the proxy will vote your    \nshares according to the Board\u2019s               \nrecommendations. How Do I Submit Voting       \nInstructions for Shares Held in Employee      \nPlans? If you hold shares in, or have been    \nawarded stock units under, certain employee   \nplans, you will separately receive directions \non how to submit your voting instructions.    \nShares held in the following employee plans   \nalso are subject to the following rules:      \n401(k) Plan. The Northern Trust Company       \n(Northern Trust), the 401(k) Plan\u2019s trustee,  \nmust receive your voting instructions for the \ncommon stock held on your behalf in the 401(k)\nPlan on or before May 20, 2024. If Northern   \nTrust does not receive your voting            \ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares together with other unvoted, forfeited \nand unallocated shares in the 401(k) Plan in  \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives from other participants in   \nthe 401(k) Plan. On March 25, 2024, there were\n28,280,294 shares in the 401(k) Plan. Other   \nEquity-Based Plans. State Street Global       \nAdvisors Trust Company acts as trustee for the\nTrust that holds shares of common stock       \nunderlying stock units awarded to employees   \nunder several of Morgan Stanley\u2019s equity-based\nplans. Employees allocated shares held in the \nTrust must submit their voting instructions   \nfor receipt by the trustee on or before May   \n20, 2024. If the trustee does not receive your\ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares, together with shares held in the Trust\nthat are unallocated or held on behalf of     \nformer Morgan Stanley employees and employees \nin certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., in \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives for shares held in the Trust \nin connection with such plans. On March 25,   \n2024, 58,298,248 shares were held in the Trust\nin connection with such plans. How Can I      \nRevoke My Proxy? You can revoke your proxy at \nany time before your shares are voted by (1)  \ndelivering a written revocation notice prior  \nto the annual meeting to Martin M. Cohen,     \nCorporate Secretary, Morgan Stanley, 1585     \nBroadway, Suite C, New York, New York 10036;  \n(2) submitting a later-dated proxy that we    \nreceive no later than when the polls close    \nduring the annual meeting; or (3) voting at   \nthe annual meeting. Attending the annual      \nmeeting does not revoke your proxy unless you \nvote at the meeting.                          \n                                          \n  130MORGAN STANLEY 2024 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                        \n  Information About the Annual Meeting  \n                                        \nWhy Did I Receive a One-Page Notice Regarding \nthe Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? \nPursuant to SEC rules, we are mailing to      \ncertain of our shareholders a Notice about the\navailability of proxy materials on the        \nInternet instead of paper copies of the proxy \nmaterials. This process allows us to expedite \nour shareholders\u2019 receipt of proxy materials, \nlower the costs of distribution and reduce the\nenvironmental impact of our annual meeting.   \nAll shareholders receiving the Notice will    \nhave the ability to access the proxy materials\nand submit a proxy over the Internet. It is   \nimportant that you submit your proxy to have  \nyour shares voted. Instructions on how to     \naccess the proxy materials over the Internet  \nor to request a paper copy of the proxy       \nmaterials may be found in the Notice. The     \nNotice is not a proxy card and cannot be      \nreturned to submit your vote. You must follow \nthe instructions on the Notice to submit your \nproxy to have your shares voted. Other        \nBusiness We do not know of any other matters  \nthat may be presented for action at the       \nmeeting other than those described in this    \nproxy statement. If any other matter is       \nproperly brought before the meeting, the proxy\nholders will vote on such matter in their     \ndiscretion as permitted under SEC rules.
