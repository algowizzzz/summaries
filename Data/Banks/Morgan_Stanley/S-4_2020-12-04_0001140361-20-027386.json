It is a condition to the\nobligations of Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance\nto complete the Mergers that each of Morgan\nStanley and Eaton Vance receive an opinion\nfrom Davis Polk and WilmerHale, respectively\n(or, in each case, another third party\nnationally recognized law or accounting firm\nreasonably agreed to by the parties), dated\nthe closing date of the Mergers, to the effect\nthat the Mergers, taken together as an\nintegrated transaction, will qualify as a\n\u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code. These opinions of counsel\nwill be based on assumptions, representations,\nwarranties and covenants of Eaton Vance,\nMorgan Stanley, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2.\nIf any of the assumptions, representations,\ncovenants or undertakings is incorrect,\nincomplete, inaccurate, or is violated, the\nvalidity of the opinions may be affected and\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Mergers could differ materially from those\ndescribed in this information\nstatement/prospectus.

Assuming that the Mergers\nqualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (i)\u00a0a\nholder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nreceives solely shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock in the Mergers generally will not\nrecognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes as a result of such exchange,\nexcept with respect to the receipt of cash in\nlieu of a fractional share of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock and (ii)\u00a0a holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock who receives a combination of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock and cash in the\nMergers generally will recognize gain (equal\nto the excess, if any, of the value of the\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock plus the amount of\ncash received over the holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the Eaton Vance Common Stock\nexchanged therefor), but not loss, to the\nextent such gain does not exceed the amount of\ncash the holder receives in such exchange. A\nholder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nreceives solely cash in the Mergers will\nrecognize gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount of cash\nreceived and the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\nin the shares exchanged therefor.\n\nThe Special Dividend. For U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, the Special Dividend is intended\nto be treated, and will be reported by Eaton\nVance to shareholders of record on December 4,\n2020, as a distribution by Eaton Vance within\nthe meaning of Section 301 of the Code. Under\nSection 301 of the Code, the Special Dividend\nwill be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes to the extent paid out of\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits of\nEaton Vance.

No assurance can be\ngiven concerning the market prices of shares  \nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock and shares of  \nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common stock before    \ncompletion of the Mergers or shares of Morgan \nStanley Common Stock after completion of the  \nMergers. The aggregate proportion of the      \nMerger Consideration payable in Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock is fixed and will not be adjusted\nfor changes in the stock prices of either     \ncompany before the Mergers are completed, and \neven if an Eaton Vance stockholder elects to  \nreceive all cash in the Mergers, the amount of\ncash to which such stockholder is entitled    \nwill depend on the price of Morgan Stanley    \nCommon Stock and the terms of the Merger      \nAgreement described under \u201cThe Merger         \nAgreement\u2014Allocation of Merger Consideration  \nand Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d  \nbeginning on page 87of this information       \nstatement/prospectus. As a result, any changes\nin the market price of Morgan Stanley Common  \nStock will have a corresponding effect on the \nmarket value of the Merger Consideration.     \nDividends Morgan Stanley currently pays a     \nquarterly dividend on shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock and last paid a quarterly        \ndividend on November 13, 2020 of $0.35 per    \nshare.

Eaton Vance currently pays a     \nquarterly dividend on shares of Eaton Vance   \nCommon Stock and last paid a quarterly        \ndividend on November 13, 2020 of $0.375 per   \nshare. Under the terms of the Merger          \nAgreement, during the period before completion\nof the Mergers, Eaton Vance is not permitted  \nto declare, set aside or pay any dividend or  \nother distribution (other than the Special    \nDividend) in respect of Eaton Vance Common    \nStock other than regular cash dividends in the\nordinary course of business consistent with   \npast practice in an amount not to exceed      \n$0.375 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock  \nper quarter (as such amount may be adjusted to\nreflect any stock dividends, subdivisions,    \nsplits, combinations or other similar events  \nrelating to Eaton Vance Common Stock). Subject\nto the terms of the Merger Agreement, Eaton   \nVance is obligated under the Merger Agreement \nto pay prior to the Effective Time a cash     \ndividend equal to $4.25 per share of Eaton    \nVance Common Stock to holders of record of    \nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock as of the  \napplicable record date.

You\nshould also read and consider the risk factors\nassociated with each of the businesses of\nMorgan Stanley and Eaton Vance because these\nrisk factors may affect the operations and\nfinancial results of the combined company.\nThese risk factors may be found under Part I,\nItem 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in each of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s and Eaton Vance\u2019s Annual Reports on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019\nand the fiscal year ended October\u00a031, 2019,\nrespectively, filed with the SEC on\nFebruary\u00a027, 2020 and December\u00a020, 2019,\nrespectively, and in Morgan Stanley\u2019s and\nEaton Vance\u2019s subsequent filings with the SEC,\nin each case, which are incorporated by\nreference into this information\nstatement/prospectus. For information on where\nyou can obtain copies of this information, see\n\u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 153 of this information\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nThe price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock might\nincrease or decline prior to the completion of\nthe Mergers, which could change the value of\nthe Merger Consideration to be received by\nEaton Vance stockholders pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement.\n\nThe market price of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock at the time the Mergers are completed\nmay vary significantly from the price on the\ndate of the Merger Agreement. On October\u00a07,\n2020, the last full trading day prior to media\npublications regarding the proposed Mergers,\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock closed at $48.71\nper share as reported on the NYSE. If the\nmarket price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nincreases above $48.71, the market value of\nthe Merger Consideration will be greater than\n$56.50 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock.\nIf the market price of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock decreases below $48.71, the market value\nof the Merger Consideration will be less than\n$56.50 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock.\n\nUpon completion of the Mergers, Eaton Vance\nstockholders will be entitled to receive for\neach share of Eaton Vance Common Stock that\nthey own, at the election of each stockholder,\nsubject to automatic adjustment, consideration\nin the form of a combination of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock and cash, only cash or only\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock. The aggregate\nproportion of the Merger Consideration payable\nin Morgan Stanley Common Stock is fixed and\nwill not be adjusted for changes in the stock\nprices of either company before the Mergers\nare completed, and even if an Eaton Vance\nstockholder elects to receive all cash in the\nMergers, the amount of cash to which such\nstockholder is entitled will depend on the\nprice of Morgan Stanley Common Stock and the\nterms of the Merger Agreement described under\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Allocation of Merger\nConsideration and Illustrative Elections and\nCalculations\u201d beginning on page 87 of this\ninformation statement/prospectus. As a result,\nany changes in the market price of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock will have a corresponding\neffect on the market value of the Merger\nConsideration. Neither party, however, has a\nright to terminate the Merger Agreement based\nsolely (and in and of itself) upon changes in\nthe market price of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock or Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock.\n\nThe market price of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock after the Mergers may be affected by\nfactors different from those affecting the\nmarket price of Eaton Vance Common Stock.\n\nUpon completion of the Mergers, holders of\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock will become\nholders of shares of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock. The businesses of Morgan Stanley differ\nfrom those of Eaton Vance in important\nrespects, and, accordingly, the results of\noperations of Morgan Stanley after the\nMergers, as well as the market price of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock, may be affected by\nfactors different from those currently\naffecting the results of operations of Eaton\nVance. For further information on the\nrespective businesses of Morgan Stanley and\nEaton Vance and certain factors to consider in\nconnection with those businesses, see the\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this\ninformation statement/prospectus and referred\nto in \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 153 of this information\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nAdditionally, the market price of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock may fluctuate\nsignificantly following completion of the\nMergers, and holders of Eaton Vance Common\nStock could lose the value of their investment\nin Morgan Stanley Common Stock. The issuance\nof shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock in\nthe Mergers could on its own have the effect\nof depressing the market price for Morgan\nStanley Common Stock. In addition, many Eaton\nVance stockholders may decide not to hold the\nshares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock they\nreceive as a result of\n                      30                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nthe Mergers. Other Eaton Vance stockholders,  \nsuch as funds with limitations on their       \npermitted holdings of stock in individual     \nissuers, may be required to sell the shares of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock they receive as a \nresult of the Mergers. Any such sales of      \nMorgan Stanley Common Stock could have the    \neffect of depressing the market price for     \nMorgan Stanley Common Stock. Moreover, general\nfluctuations in stock markets could have a    \nmaterial adverse effect on the market for, or \nliquidity of, the Morgan Stanley Common Stock,\nregardless of Morgan Stanley\u2019s actual         \noperating performance. After completion of the\nMergers, Morgan Stanley may fail to realize   \nthe anticipated benefits and cost savings of  \nthe Mergers, which could adversely affect the \nvalue of Morgan Stanley Common Stock. The     \nsuccess of the Mergers will depend, in        \nsignificant part, on Morgan Stanley\u2019s ability \nto realize the anticipated benefits and cost  \nsavings from combining the businesses of      \nMorgan Stanley and Eaton Vance. The ability of\nMorgan Stanley to realize these anticipated   \nbenefits and cost savings is subject to       \ncertain risks including:                      \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley\u2019s ability to              \n  \u2022  successfully combine the businesses of   \n     Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance;          \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  whether the combined business will       \n     perform as expected;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     the possibility that Morgan Stanley      \n  \u2022  paid more for Eaton Vance than the       \n     value Morgan Stanley will derive from    \n     the acquisition; and                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  the assumption of known and unknown      \n     liabilities of Eaton Vance.              \n                                              \nIf Morgan Stanley is not able to successfully \ncombine the businesses of Morgan Stanley and  \nEaton Vance within the anticipated time frame,\nor at all, the anticipated cost savings and   \nother benefits of the Mergers may not be      \nrealized fully, or at all, or may take longer \nto realize than expected, the combined        \nbusiness may not perform as expected and the  \nvalue of the Morgan Stanley Common Stock      \n(including the Merger Consideration) may be   \nadversely affected. Morgan Stanley and Eaton  \nVance have operated and, until completion of  \nthe Mergers, will continue to operate,        \nindependently, and there can be no assurances \nthat their businesses can be integrated       \nsuccessfully. It is possible that the         \nintegration process could result in the loss  \nof key Morgan Stanley or Eaton Vance          \nemployees, the loss of clients, the disruption\nof either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing\nbusinesses or in unexpected integration       \nissues, higher than expected integration costs\nand an overall post-completion integration    \nprocess that takes longer than originally     \nanticipated. Specifically, the following      \nissues, among others, must be addressed in    \nintegrating the operations of Morgan Stanley  \nand Eaton Vance in order to realize the       \nanticipated benefits of the Mergers so the    \ncombined business performs as expected:       \n                                              \n     combining certain of the companies\u2019      \n  \u2022  operations, financial, reporting and     \n     corporate functions;

Although Morgan\nStanley and Eaton Vance have agreed in the\nMerger Agreement to use their reasonable best\nefforts, subject to certain limitations, to\nmake certain governmental filings or obtain\nthe required governmental authorizations, as\nthe case may be, there can be no assurance\nthat the relevant waiting periods will expire\nor that the relevant authorizations will be\nobtained. In addition, the governmental\nauthorities with or from which these\nauthorizations are required have broad\ndiscretion in administering the governing\nregulations. Adverse developments in Morgan\nStanley\u2019s or Eaton Vance\u2019s regulatory standing\nor any other factors considered by regulators\nin granting such approvals; governmental,\npolitical or community group inquiries,\ninvestigations or opposition; or changes in\nlegislation or the political environment\ngenerally could affect whether and when\nrequired governmental authorizations are\ngranted. As a condition to authorization of\nthe Mergers, governmental authorities may\nimpose requirements, limitations or costs or\nplace restrictions on the conduct of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s business after completion of the\nMergers. There can be no assurance that\nregulators will not impose conditions, terms,\nobligations or restrictions and that such\nconditions, terms, obligations or restrictions\nwill not have the effect of delaying the\nclosing of the Mergers or imposing additional\nmaterial costs on or materially limiting the\nrevenues of the combined company following the\nMergers, or otherwise adversely affecting\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s businesses and results of\noperations after completion of the Mergers. In\naddition, there can be no assurance that these\nterms, obligations or restrictions will not\nresult in the delay or abandonment of the\nMergers. See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions\nto Completion of the Mergers\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant\u201d\nbeginning on pages 93 and 105 , respectively,\nof this information statement/prospectus.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s and Eaton Vance\u2019s business\nrelationships may be subject to disruption due\nto uncertainty associated with the Mergers.\n\nParties with which Morgan Stanley or Eaton\nVance does business may experience uncertainty\nassociated with the Mergers, including with\nrespect to current or future business\nrelationships with Morgan Stanley, Eaton Vance\nor the combined business. Morgan Stanley\u2019s and\nEaton Vance\u2019s business relationships may be\nsubject to disruption as parties with which\nMorgan Stanley or Eaton Vance does business\nmay attempt to negotiate changes in existing\nbusiness relationships or consider entering\ninto business relationships with parties other\nthan Morgan Stanley, Eaton Vance or the\ncombined business. These disruptions could\nhave an adverse effect on the businesses,\nfinancial\n                      33                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \ncondition, results of operations or prospects \nof the combined business, including an adverse\neffect on Morgan Stanley\u2019s ability to realize \nthe anticipated benefits of the Mergers. The  \nrisk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions \ncould be exacerbated by a delay in completion \nof the Mergers or termination of the Merger   \nAgreement. Certain of Eaton Vance\u2019s executive \nofficers and directors have interests in the  \nMergers that may be different from your       \ninterests as a stockholder of Eaton Vance or  \nas a stockholder of Morgan Stanley. In        \nconsidering the recommendation of the Eaton   \nVance board of directors to vote for the      \napproval of the Merger Agreement and the      \nMergers, Eaton Vance stockholders should be   \naware that the directors and executive        \nofficers of Eaton Vance may have interests in \nthe Mergers that are different from, or in    \naddition to, the interests of Eaton Vance     \nstockholders generally, including potential   \naccelerated vesting of equity awards and      \nseverance payments and certain arrangements   \nand agreements with Morgan Stanley. The Eaton \nVance board of directors was aware of these   \ninterests and considered them, among other    \nmatters, in evaluating and negotiating the    \nMerger Agreement and approving the Mergers,   \nand in making its recommendation that the     \nVoting Trust vote to approve the Merger       \nAgreement and the Mergers and the other       \ntransactions contemplated by the Merger       \nAgreement. For more information, see          \n\u201cInterests of Eaton Vance\u2019s Directors and     \nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u201d beginning  \non page 118of this information                \nstatement/prospectus. Failure to complete the \nMergers could negatively impact the stock     \nprice and the future business and financial   \nresults of Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance. If \nthe Mergers are not completed for any reason, \nthe ongoing businesses of Morgan Stanley and  \nEaton Vance may be adversely affected, and    \nwithout realizing any of the benefits of      \nhaving completed the Mergers, Morgan Stanley  \nand Eaton Vance would be subject to a number  \nof risks, including the following:            \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance may       \n     experience negative reactions from the   \n  \u2022  financial markets, including negative    \n     impacts on their respective stock        \n     prices;                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance may       \n  \u2022  experience negative reactions from       \n     their respective clients, regulators     \n     and employees;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance will be   \n  \u2022  required to pay certain costs relating   \n     to the Mergers, whether or not the       \n     Mergers are completed;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Merger Agreement places certain      \n     restrictions on the conduct of Morgan    \n     Stanley\u2019s and Eaton Vance\u2019s businesses   \n     prior to completion of the Mergers, and  \n     such restrictions, the waiver of which   \n     are subject to the written consent of    \n     the other party (in certain cases, not   \n     to be unreasonably withheld,             \n     conditioned or delayed), and subject to  \n     certain exceptions and qualifications,   \n     may prevent Eaton Vance and Morgan       \n     Stanley from making certain              \n  \u2022  acquisitions, taking certain other       \n     specified actions or otherwise pursuing  \n     business opportunities during the        \n     pendency of the Mergers that Morgan      \n     Stanley or Eaton Vance would have made,  \n     taken or pursued if these restrictions   \n     were not in place (see \u201cThe Merger       \n     Agreement\u2014Conduct of Business Pending    \n     the Mergers\u201d beginning on page99of this  \n     information statement/prospectus for a   \n     description of the restrictive           \n     covenants applicable to Eaton Vance and  \n     Morgan Stanley); and                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     matters relating to the Mergers          \n     (including integration planning) will    \n     require substantial commitments of time  \n     and resources by Morgan Stanley and      \n  \u2022  Eaton Vance management, which would      \n     otherwise have been devoted to           \n     day-to-day operations and other          \n     opportunities that may have been         \n     beneficial to either Morgan Stanley or   \n     Eaton Vance as an independent company.   \n                                              \nIn the event of a termination of the Merger   \nAgreement under certain circumstances         \nspecified in the Merger Agreement, Eaton Vance\nmay be required to pay a termination fee of   \n$206 million to Morgan Stanley. To the extent \nthat a termination fee is not promptly paid by\nEaton Vance when due, Eaton Vance is also     \nrequired to pay any reasonable and documented \ncosts and expenses (including reasonable legal\nfees and expenses) incurred by Morgan Stanley \nin connection with legal action taken to      \nenforce the Merger Agreement that results in a\njudgment for such amount against Eaton Vance  \nfor failing to promptly pay such amount,      \ntogether with interest on the unpaid fee.     \nThere can be no assurance that the risks      \ndescribed above will not materialize. If any  \nof those risks materialize, they may          \nmaterially and adversely affect Morgan        \nStanley\u2019s and/or Eaton Vance\u2019s businesses,    \nfinancial condition, financial results,       \nratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.     \n                                              \n34                                            \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nIn addition, Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance\ncould be subject to litigation related to any\nfailure to complete the Mergers or related to\nany enforcement proceeding commenced against\nMorgan Stanley or Eaton Vance to perform their\nrespective obligations under the Merger\nAgreement. If the Mergers are not completed,\nthese risks may materialize and may adversely\naffect Morgan Stanley\u2019s and/or Eaton Vance\u2019s\nbusinesses, financial condition, financial\nresults, ratings, stock prices and/or bond\nprices.\n\nThe shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock to\nbe received by Eaton Vance stockholders upon\ncompletion of the Mergers will have different\nrights from shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock.\n\nUpon completion of the Mergers, Eaton Vance\nstockholders will no longer be stockholders of\nEaton Vance but will instead become\nstockholders of Morgan Stanley. Eaton Vance\nstockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders will,\nafter completion of the Mergers, be governed\nby Delaware law (rather than Maryland law) and\nthe terms of the Morgan Stanley Certificate of\nIncorporation and the Morgan Stanley Bylaws\nare in some respects materially different than\nthe terms of the Eaton Vance Charter and the\nEaton Vance Bylaws, which currently govern the\nrights of Eaton Vance stockholders. See\n\u201cComparison of Stockholder Rights\u201d beginning\non page 131 of this information\nstatement/prospectus for a discussion of the\ndifferent rights associated with Morgan\nStanley Common Stock.\n\nAfter the Mergers, Eaton Vance stockholders\nwill have a significantly lower ownership and\nvoting interest in Morgan Stanley than they\ncurrently have in Eaton Vance and will\nexercise less influence over management.\n\nBased on the number of shares of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock and the Eaton Vance equity awards\noutstanding as of [\u2022], 2020, Morgan Stanley\nestimates that it will issue approximately [\u2022]\nshares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock pursuant\nto the Mergers. The actual number of shares of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock to be issued and\nreserved for issuance in connection with the\nMergers will be determined at completion of\nthe Mergers based on the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the number of shares of Eaton\nVance Common Stock and the Eaton Vance equity\nawards outstanding at that time. Based on the\nnumber of shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\noutstanding as of [\u2022], 2020, and the number of\nshares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock\noutstanding as of [\u2022], 2020, Morgan Stanley\nand Eaton Vance estimate that, as of\nimmediately following completion of the\nMergers, holders of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock as of immediately prior to the Mergers\nwill hold approximately [\u2022]% and holders of\nEaton Vance Common Stock immediately prior to\nthe Mergers will hold approximately [\u2022]%, of\nthe outstanding shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock (or, on a fully diluted basis,\nholders of Morgan Stanley Common Stock as of\nimmediately prior to the Mergers will hold\napproximately [\u2022]% and holders of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock as of immediately prior to the\nMergers will hold approximately [\u2022]% of the\nshares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock).\nConsequently, former Eaton Vance stockholders\nwill have less influence over the management\nand policies of Morgan Stanley than they\ncurrently have over the management and\npolicies of Eaton Vance.\n\nEaton Vance stockholders may receive a form or\ncombination of consideration different from\nwhat they elect.\n\nWhile each holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nentitled to the Merger Consideration may elect\nto receive, in connection with the Mergers,\nthe Mixed Consideration, Cash Consideration or\nStock Consideration, the total amount of cash\nand the total number of shares of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock available for all Eaton\nVance stockholders will be fixed. Accordingly,\ndepending on the elections made by other Eaton\nVance stockholders, if a holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock elects to receive all cash in\nconnection with the Mergers, such holder may\nreceive a portion of the Merger Consideration\nin Morgan Stanley Common Stock and if a holder\nof Eaton Vance Common Stock elects to receive\nall Morgan Stanley Common Stock in connection\nwith the Mergers, such holder may receive a\nportion of the Merger Consideration in cash.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Allocation of Merger\nConsideration and Illustrative Elections and\nCalculations\u201d beginning on page 87 of this\ninformation statement/prospectus for more\ninformation. If a holder of Eaton Vance Common\nStock does not submit a properly completed and\nsigned Form of Election to the Exchange Agent\nby the Election Deadline, then such\nstockholder will have no control over the type\nof Merger Consideration such stockholder may\nreceive and will receive Mixed Consideration\nconsisting of both cash and shares of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock. No fractional shares of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock will be issued in\nthe Mergers, and Eaton Vance stockholders will\nreceive cash in lieu of any fractional shares\nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock.\n\nIf you deliver shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock to make an election, you will not be\nable to sell those shares unless you revoke\nyour election prior to the Election Deadline.\n\nIf you are a holder of Eaton Vance Common\nStock and want to elect to receive the Cash\nConsideration or Stock Consideration in\nexchange for your shares, you must deliver to\nthe Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline a\n                      35                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nproperly completed Form of Election. Following\nthe delivery of a completed Form of Election,\nyou will not be able to transfer such shares\nof Eaton Vance Common Stock unless you revoke\nyour election before the Election Deadline by\nproviding written notice to the Exchange\nAgent. If you do not revoke your election\nbefore the Election Deadline, you will not be\nable to liquidate your investment in Eaton\nVance Common Stock for any reason until you\nreceive the Merger Consideration.\nEaton Vance stockholders are not entitled to  \nappraisal rights in connection with the       \nMergers.                                      \nAppraisal rights are statutory rights of\nstockholders who have not voted in favor of\nthe transaction and have complied with other\nrequirements of Section 3-202 of the Maryland\nGeneral Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) to demand\nand receive payment of the fair value of their\nshares in certain circumstances as determined\nin accordance with the MGCL instead of\nreceiving the consideration offered to\nstockholders in connection with the\ntransaction. Under the MGCL, the holders of\nshares of Eaton Vance Voting Common Stock and\nholders of shares of Eaton Vance Non-Voting\nCommon Stock will not have rights to appraisal\nof the fair value of their shares in\nconnection with the Mergers. See \u201cThe\nMergers\u2014No Dissenters\u2019 or Appraisal Rights\u201d\nbeginning on page 82 of this information\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nLawsuits may be filed against Eaton Vance and\nMorgan Stanley challenging the Mergers. An\nadverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent\nthe Mergers from being completed.\n\nOne of the conditions to completion of the\nMergers is the absence of any applicable law\n(including any order) being in effect that\nprohibits completion of the Mergers.\nAccordingly, if litigation is filed\nchallenging the Mergers and a plaintiff is\nsuccessful in obtaining an order enjoining\ncompletion of the Mergers, then such order may\nprevent the Mergers from being completed, or\nfrom being completed within the expected time\nframe.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Eaton Vance will incur\nsignificant transaction and Mergers-related\ncosts in connection with the Mergers.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Eaton Vance expect to incur\na number of non-recurring costs associated\nwith the Mergers and combining the operations\nof the two companies. The significant, non-\nrecurring costs associated with the Mergers\ninclude, among others, fees and expenses of\nfinancial advisors (which are described in\n\u201cThe Mergers\u2014Opinions of Eaton Vance\u2019s\nFinancial Advisors\u201d beginning on page 64 of\nthis information statement/prospectus) and\nother advisors and representatives, certain\nemployment-related costs relating to employees\nof Eaton Vance (which are described in\n\u201cInterests of Eaton Vance\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u201d beginning\non page 34 of this information\nstatement/prospectus), filing fees due in\nconnection with filings required under the HSR\nAct and filing fees and printing and mailing\ncosts for this information\nstatement/prospectus. Some of these costs have\nalready been incurred or may be incurred\nregardless of whether the Mergers are\ncompleted, including a portion of the fees and\nexpenses of financial advisors and other\nadvisors and representatives and filing fees\nfor this information statement/prospectus.\nMorgan Stanley also will incur transaction\nfees and costs related to formulating and\nimplementing integration plans with respect to\nthe two companies, including facilities and\nsystems consolidation costs. Morgan Stanley\ncontinues to assess the magnitude of these\ncosts, and additional unanticipated costs may\nbe incurred in the Mergers and the integration\nof the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although\nMorgan Stanley expects that the elimination of\nduplicative costs, as well as the realization\nof other efficiencies related to the\nintegration of the businesses, should allow\nMorgan Stanley to offset integration-related\ncosts over time, this net benefit may not be\nachieved in the near term, or at all.\n\nThe Mergers may not be accretive, and may be\ndilutive, to Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings per\nshare, which may negatively affect the market\nprice of Morgan Stanley Common Stock following\ncompletion of the Mergers.\n\nIn connection with the completion of the\nMergers, Morgan Stanley expects to issue\napproximately [\u2022] Morgan Stanley common shares\nand certain Eaton Vance equity awards are\nrequired to be converted into equity awards of\nMorgan Stanley pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement. The issuance of new Morgan Stanley\ncommon shares could have the effect of\ndepressing the market price of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock.\n\nMorgan Stanley currently projects that the\nMergers will result in a number of benefits,\nincluding enhanced competitive positioning and\na platform from which to accelerate growth,\nand that it will ultimately be accretive to\nearnings per share. This projection is based\non preliminary estimates that may materially\nchange.

It was the consensus of the Eaton\nVance board of directors that Morgan Stanley,\nParty B and Party C were the parties, in\naddition to Party A, to be most likely to have\nan interest in pursuing a strategic\ntransaction with Eaton Vance and to have the\nfinancial and other resources necessary to\ncomplete a transaction on terms that the Eaton\nVance board of directors would find\nacceptable. The Eaton Vance board of directors\ndiscussed whether other\n                      44                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nparties should be contacted as part of the\nmarket check and, taking into account the\nrecommendations of management and the\ndiscussions with Centerview, concluded that\nthe potential benefit of contacting parties\nbeyond Party A, Morgan Stanley, Party B and\nParty C at that time was outweighed by the\nrisk that contacting additional parties would\nadversely affect Eaton Vance\u2019s business and\noperations, including by distracting\nmanagement and/or resulting in leaks or market\nrumors that could harm Eaton Vance, and that,\ntherefore, additional parties should not be\ncontacted at that time.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, at the direction of the\nEaton Vance board of directors,\nrepresentatives of Centerview separately\ncontacted representatives of each of Morgan\nStanley, Party B and Party C by telephone to\ninquire as to their interest in pursuing a\npotential strategic transaction involving\nEaton Vance and provided to each party by\nelectronic mail a proposed form of\nnondisclosure agreement to facilitate further\ndiscussions regarding a potential strategic\ntransaction.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, Eaton Vance and Party B\nentered into a nondisclosure agreement, which\nincluded, among other provisions, a one-year\nstandstill provision that would cease to apply\nby its terms upon Eaton Vance\u2019s entry into a\ndefinitive agreement to be acquired by another\nparty.\n\nOn July 14, 2020, Eaton Vance and Morgan\nStanley entered into a nondisclosure\nagreement, which included, among other\nprovisions, a one-year standstill provision\nthat would cease to apply by its terms upon\nEaton Vance\u2019s entry into a definitive\nagreement to be acquired by another party.\n\nOn July 14, 2020, at the direction of the\nEaton Vance board of directors,\nrepresentatives of Centerview then separately\nprovided to representatives of Morgan Stanley\nand representatives of Party B by electronic\nmail a copy of a confidential management\npresentation regarding Eaton Vance\u2019s business\n(the \u201cManagement Presentation\u201d). Also on July\n14, 2020, a representative of Party C informed\nrepresentatives of Centerview that Party C had\ndecided not to pursue a strategic transaction\nwith Eaton Vance.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors held a regularly scheduled meeting\nby videoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and a representative of WilmerHale.\nDuring the meeting, the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors discussed with management and the\nCenterview representatives the Party A Initial\nProposal and the status of discussions between\nEaton Vance and each of Morgan Stanley, Party\nB and Party C (including that Party C had\ndecided not to pursue a strategic transaction\nwith Eaton Vance). At the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Centerview provided their\npreliminary valuation perspectives on the\nParty A Initial Proposal, including by\nreviewing (i) the Eaton Vance Forecasts and\nthe material assumptions reflected therein,\n(ii) a summary of the preliminary financial\nanalyses performed by Centerview (including by\nsummarizing the various judgments and\nassumptions reflected in such financial\nanalyses and the rationale therefor) and (iii)\nCenterview\u2019s preliminary valuation\nperspectives on Party A. Following discussion,\nthe Eaton Vance board of directors directed\nmanagement to indicate to Party A that the\nvaluation reflected in the Party A Initial\nProposal was inadequate, but that Eaton Vance\nwould be willing to continue due diligence\nactivities with Party A to facilitate a\nrevised proposal at a higher valuation. The\nEaton Vance board of directors then discussed\nwhether Eaton Vance should invite other\nparties to participate in Eaton Vance\u2019s market\ncheck at that time, taking into account the\npotential advantage that contacting additional\nparties could increase competition and lead to\na higher valuation and the disadvantage that\ncontacting additional parties could adversely\naffect Eaton Vance\u2019s business and operations,\nincluding by distracting management and/or\nresulting in leaks or market rumors that could\nharm Eaton Vance. Following the discussion, it\nwas the consensus of the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors, consistent with the recommendation\nof management and taking into account\ndiscussions with Centerview, that management\nshould invite the company referred to as Party\nD to participate in Eaton Vance\u2019s market\ncheck.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, Mr. Faust met by\nvideoconference with a representative of Party\nA to convey that the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors considered the valuation reflected\nin the Party A Initial Proposal to be\ninadequate, but that Eaton Vance would be\nwilling to continue due diligence activities\nwith Party A to facilitate Party A submitting\na revised proposal at a higher valuation.\n\nOn July 16, 2020 and July 17, 2020, at the\ndirection of the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors, representatives of Centerview\ncontacted representatives of Party D by\ntelephone to inquire as to Party D\u2019s interest\nin pursuing a potential strategic transaction\ninvolving Eaton Vance and provided to\nrepresentatives of Party D by electronic mail\na proposed form of nondisclosure agreement to\nfacilitate further discussions regarding a\npotential strategic transaction with Eaton\nVance.\n                      45                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nAlso on July 17, 2020, Eaton Vance provided\ncertain representatives of Morgan Stanley with\naccess to a virtual data room that contained\nmaterials and information applicable to Morgan\nStanley\u2019s due diligence investigation of Eaton\nVance and the potential transaction, including\nthe Eaton Vance Forecasts.\n\nDuring the period between the middle of July\nand early September 2020, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley had a series of videoconference\nand telephonic meetings with representatives\nof Eaton Vance and representatives of\nCenterview in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s\ndue diligence investigation of Eaton Vance and\nin connection with Eaton Vance\u2019s reverse due\ndiligence investigation of Morgan Stanley.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Mr. Faust, Mr. Langstraat,\nMs. Hylton and representatives of Centerview\nmet with representatives of Party B by\nvideoconference to provide an overview of\nEaton Vance\u2019s business and other information\napplicable to Party B\u2019s evaluation of a\npotential strategic transaction with Eaton\nVance.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Mr. Faust and\nrepresentatives of Centerview met with\nrepresentatives of Party D by videoconference,\nduring which Mr. Faust provided an overview of\nEaton Vance\u2019s business.\n\nOn July 25, 2020, a representative of Party D\ninformed representatives of Centerview that\nParty D had decided not to pursue a strategic\ntransaction with Eaton Vance.\n\nOn July 28, 2020, representatives of Eaton\nVance and Centerview held a videoconference\nmeeting with representatives of Party B in\nconnection with Party B\u2019s due diligence\ninvestigation of Eaton Vance.\n\nOn July 29, 2020, a representative of Party B\ninformed representatives of Centerview that\nParty B had decided not to pursue a strategic\ntransaction with Eaton Vance.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, representatives of the\nEaton Vance board of directors and management,\nled by Mr. Faust and Ms. Hylton, and\nrepresentatives of Centerview met by\nvideoconference with Party A\u2019s Chief Financial\nOfficer and other representatives of Party A\nas part of Eaton Vance\u2019s and Centerview\u2019s\nevaluation of Party A\u2019s business outlook and\nthe prospects for Party A common stock over\nthe period until the closing of a potential\ntransaction between Eaton Vance and Party A,\nand thereafter.\n\nAlso on August 4, 2020, a representative of\nWilmerHale sent to Party A\u2019s legal counsel a\nproposed form of merger agreement, which\ncontemplated an acquisition of Eaton Vance by\nParty A in an all-stock transaction at an\nunspecified value and exchange ratio,\ncontemplated that Party A would not require\nany employees of Eaton Vance to enter into\nemployment arrangements with Party A as a\nprecondition to execution of the merger\nagreement, contemplated that the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors would have the right to\nterminate the merger agreement to accept a\nsuperior proposal or to change its\nrecommendation in response to an intervening\nevent prior to receipt of the Eaton Vance\nStockholder Approval, required Party A to pay\nEaton Vance an unspecified termination fee if\nrequisite regulatory and antitrust approvals\nwere not obtained, obligated Eaton Vance to\nuse reasonable best efforts to obtain the\nEaton Vance Stockholder Approval within 15\nbusiness days after the registration statement\ncontemplated by the merger agreement was\ndeclared effective, gave each party the right\nto terminate the merger agreement if the Eaton\nVance Stockholder Approval were not obtained\nby such date and required as a closing\ncondition that Eaton Vance obtain consent from\nclients representing at least 70% of Eaton\nVance\u2019s management fee revenue run-rate\ncalculated as of specified measurement date.\nDuring the period between August 4, 2020 and\nAugust 28, 2020, representatives of WilmerHale\nand representatives of Party A\u2019s legal counsel\nexchanged drafts of the proposed merger\nagreement, culminating in the delivery by\nParty A\u2019s legal counsel to representatives of\nWilmerHale on August 28, 2020 of a revised\nform of merger agreement, which indicated\nthat, as a condition to Party\u2019s A willingness\nto enter into the merger agreement with Eaton\nVance, Party A required that certain employees\nof Eaton Vance enter into employee offer\nletters and restrictive covenant agreements\nwith Party A, eliminated the right of the\nEaton Vance board of directors to terminate\nthe merger agreement to accept a superior\nproposal or to change its recommendation in\nresponse to an intervening event prior to\nreceipt of the Eaton Vance Stockholder\nApproval, eliminated Party A\u2019s obligations to\npay Eaton Vance a termination fee if requisite\nregulatory and antitrust approvals were not\nobtained, gave Party A (but not Eaton Vance)\nthe right to terminate the merger agreement if\nthe Eaton Vance Stockholder Approval were not\nobtained within 24 hours after the execution\nof the merger agreement and required as a\nclosing condition that Eaton Vance obtain\nconsent from clients representing at least 75%\nof Eaton Vance\u2019s management fee revenue run-\nrate calculated as of specified measurement\ndate.\n\nAlso on August 4, 2020, Mr. Faust and James\nGorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nof Morgan Stanley, met by videoconference.\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Faust and Mr. Gorman\ndiscussed the potential acquisition of Eaton\nVance by Morgan Stanley and the form and\namount of consideration that Morgan Stanley\nmight be willing\n                      46                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nto offer Eaton Vance stockholders. Mr. Gorman\ninformed Mr. Faust that Morgan Stanley would\nnot commence a transaction with Eaton Vance\nuntil after the closing of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nthen-pending acquisition of E*TRADE Financial\nCorporation (\u201cE*TRADE\u201d), which he told Mr.\nFaust he believed would likely occur before\nOctober 15, 2020.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, representatives of Morgan\nStanley and Mr. Faust participated in a\nteleconference during which the potential\nvaluation of Eaton Vance in a transaction with\nMorgan Stanley was discussed. Later on August\n5, 2020, representatives of Morgan Stanley\nsent to Eaton Vance a letter describing Morgan\nStanley\u2019s views of the rationale and benefits\nof a potential transaction.\n\nOn August 6, 2020, the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and a representative of WilmerHale,\nto discuss the communications with Morgan\nStanley, Party A, Party B and Party D since\nthe meeting of the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors held on July 15, 2020. The\nrepresentatives of Centerview reported that\neach of Party B and Party D had decided not to\npursue a strategic transaction with Eaton\nVance and that Eaton Vance remained in\ndiscussions with each of Morgan Stanley and\nParty A regarding a potential strategic\ntransaction. The Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors then discussed potential\ncommunications with each of Morgan Stanley and\nParty A. After the discussion, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors directed management to\ncommunicate to Morgan Stanley that, while the\nEaton Vance board of directors was unwilling\nto delay its process in light of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s timing constraints, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors would give due\nconsideration to a strategic transaction\nproposal received from Morgan Stanley. The\nEaton Vance board of directors also directed\nmanagement to communicate to Party A a\ncounterproposal to increase the exchange ratio\nin a proposed strategic transaction with Party\nA to a number of shares of Party A common\nstock per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nthat implicitly valued Eaton Vance Common\nStock at $55.91 per share based on the closing\nmarket price per share of Party A common stock\non August 6, 2020 (the \u201cParty A\nCounterproposal\u201d). As part of the Party A\nCounterproposal, the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors authorized and directed management\nto inform Party A that one or more other\nparties had expressed interest in a strategic\ntransaction with Eaton Vance, but that Eaton\nVance would be willing to negotiate\nexclusively with Party A if Party A were to\nrespond quickly to accept the Party A\nCounterproposal.\n\nDuring the period between August 7, 2020 and\nAugust 11, 2020, Mr. Gorman and Mr. Faust had\nmultiple videoconference meetings to further\ndiscuss the consideration that Morgan Stanley\nmight be willing to offer Eaton Vance\nstockholders in connection with the potential\nacquisition of Eaton Vance by Morgan Stanley,\nthe mix of such consideration between cash and\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock, and the timing of\nexecuting a potential definitive merger\nagreement.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, Mr. Faust met by\nvideoconference with a representative of Party\nA to convey the Party A Counterproposal. Mr.\nFaust informed the Party A representative that\none or more other parties had expressed\ninterest in a strategic transaction with Eaton\nVance, but that Eaton Vance would be willing\nto negotiate exclusively with Party A if Party\nA were to respond quickly to accept the Party\nA Counterproposal.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, Eaton Vance received from\nMorgan Stanley a non-binding written proposal\n(the \u201cMorgan Stanley Initial Proposal\u201d) for\nthe acquisition of Eaton Vance by Morgan\nStanley at a value of $55.00 per share of\nEaton Vance Common Stock, financed with 50%\ncash and 50% Morgan Stanley Common Stock, with\nthe consideration including a fixed cash\ncomponent and a fixed exchange ratio to be set\nat a later date prior to execution of a\ndefinitive merger agreement based on agreed-\nupon terms. The Morgan Stanley Initial\nProposal stated Morgan Stanley\u2019s expectation\nthat the E*TRADE transaction would close on or\naround October 1, 2020, and represented that\nMorgan Stanley would move expeditiously to\nexecute a definitive merger agreement with\nEaton Vance within seven days after the\nclosing of the E*TRADE transaction, subject to\ncompletion of confirmatory due diligence.\n\nAlso on August 12, 2020, a representative of\nParty A informed Mr. Faust by telephone that\nParty A was not prepared to submit a revised\nproposal at that time. On the same date, a\nrepresentative of Party A sent to\nrepresentatives of WilmerHale a proposed\nexclusivity agreement, which contemplated that\nEaton Vance would negotiate exclusively with\nParty A through September 8, 2020.\n\nLater on August 12, 2020, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and a representative of WilmerHale.\nAt the meeting, Mr. Faust reported on his\ncommunications with Morgan Stanley and Party A\nsince the meeting of the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors held on August 6, 2020. The Eaton\nVance board of directors discussed the Morgan\nStanley Initial Proposal and the status of\nnegotiations with Party A. Mr. Gorman then\njoined a portion of the meeting to review\n                      47                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nthe Morgan Stanley Initial Proposal and to\nprovide an overview of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nbusiness and strategic rationale for the\nproposed acquisition of Eaton Vance. After Mr.\nGorman departed the meeting, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors discussed potential\nresponses to each of Morgan Stanley and Party\nA. After the discussion, the Eaton Vance board\nof directors directed management to continue\ndiscussions with Morgan Stanley regarding a\npotential strategic transaction, including by\nfacilitating Morgan Stanley\u2019s due diligence\ninvestigation of Eaton Vance and providing to\nMorgan Stanley a proposed form of merger\nagreement. The Eaton Vance board of directors\nalso directed management to inform\nrepresentatives of Party A that Eaton Vance\nwould not agree to an exclusivity arrangement\nor permit Party A to meet with Eaton Vance\u2019s\nsenior management team, as had been requested\nby Party A, unless and until the parties\nreached agreement on the stock exchange ratio\nfor a potential strategic transaction, but\nthat representatives of Eaton Vance and its\nadvisors would continue to work with Party A\ntoward a potential strategic transaction. Mr.\nFaust conveyed this message to a\nrepresentative of Party A during a telephone\ncall on August 13, 2020.\n\nAlso on August 13, 2020, at the direction of\nthe Eaton Vance board of directors,\nrepresentatives of Centerview sent\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley a draft\nmerger agreement for the acquisition of Eaton\nVance by Morgan Stanley, which was consistent\nin all material respects with the form of\nmerger agreement that had been provided by a\nrepresentative of WilmerHale to\nrepresentatives of Party A\u2019s legal counsel on\nAugust 4, 2020.\n\nOn August 18, 2020, Mr. Faust met by\nvideoconference with a representative of Party\nA, who informed Mr. Faust that Party A\nintended to increase the value of Party A\u2019s\ntransaction proposal, but would need some\nadditional time to submit a revised proposal.\n\nDuring the period between August 25, 2020 and\nAugust 27, 2020, representatives of Eaton\nVance and WilmerHale had a series of\ntelephonic meetings with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Davis Polk, Morgan\nStanley\u2019s legal advisor, in connection with\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s due diligence investigation\nof Eaton Vance, including on the topics of\nbusiness and finance matters, legal matters,\nintellectual property and information\ntechnology matters, regulatory and compliance\nmatters, and tax matters.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, the Voting Trustees held a\nmeeting by videoconference, which was attended\nby representatives of Centerview. During the\nmeeting, Mr. Faust and the representatives of\nCenterview discussed with the Voting Trustees\nEaton Vance\u2019s current industry position, the\nrange of strategic alternatives available to\nEaton Vance and the status of Eaton Vance\u2019s\ndiscussions with Party A and Morgan Stanley.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, Mr. Faust met by\nvideoconference with representatives of Party\nA, who informed Mr. Faust that Party A would\nbe submitting a revised non-binding written\nproposal (the \u201cParty A Second Proposal\u201d) to\nacquire Eaton Vance in an all-stock\ntransaction at an increased exchange ratio\ncompared to the Party A Initial Proposal, but\nat a lower exchange ratio than the Party A\nCounterproposal. Based on the closing market\nprice per share of Party A\u2019s common stock on\nAugust 27, 2020, the Party A Second Proposal\nimplicitly valued Eaton Vance Common Stock at\n$55.27 per share on that date. During the\ndiscussion, the Party A representatives noted\nthat, while their due diligence had confirmed\nthe strategic fit, Party A had a less\nfavorable overall view of Eaton Vance\u2019s\nbusiness than when it made the Party A Initial\nProposal. Following Mr. Faust\u2019s meeting with\nrepresentatives of Party A, he received from\nrepresentatives of Party A a letter\nmemorializing the Party A Second Proposal and\nrequesting Eaton Vance\u2019s commitment to\nnegotiate exclusively with Party A through\nSeptember 15, 2020. The Party A Second\nProposal was conditioned on entering into the\nrequested exclusivity agreement by 9:00 a.m.,\nEastern time, on August 31, 2020, and subject\nto completion of due diligence, negotiation of\na definitive agreement and final approval of\nthe boards of directors of Party A and Eaton\nVance.\n\nOn August 28, 2020, Mr. Faust met by\nvideoconference with a representative of Party\nA. Mr. Faust told the Party A representative\nthat the previous day\u2019s discussion led Mr.\nFaust to believe that Party A was not likely\nto materially increase its bid beyond the\nParty A Second Proposal. The Party A\nrepresentative confirmed to Mr. Faust that Mr.\nFaust\u2019s assessment of Party A\u2019s position was\ncorrect.\n\nLater on August 28, 2020, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and a representative of WilmerHale,\nto further discuss the Morgan Stanley Initial\nProposal and to consider the Party A Second\nProposal. The Eaton Vance board of directors\nthen reviewed Centerview\u2019s relationship\ndisclosure with respect to Morgan Stanley and\nconcluded that the relationships between\nCenterview and Morgan Stanley disclosed\ntherein did not present a material conflict of\ninterest. Mr. Faust then reported to the Eaton\nVance board of directors on his recent\nconversations with representatives of Morgan\nStanley and Party A. Mr. Faust stated to the\nEaton Vance board of directors his belief,\nbased on his most recent conversations with\nrepresentatives of Party A, that Party A was\nnot likely to materially\n                      48                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nincrease its bid beyond the Party A Second\nProposal. The Eaton Vance board of directors\ndiscussed, among other things, the material\nissues presented by the Party A Second\nProposal and Party A\u2019s most recent draft\nmerger agreement, the potential advantages and\ndisadvantages of the Party A Second Proposal\nversus the Morgan Stanley Initial Proposal in\nlight of the potential timeline for entering\ninto a definitive agreement with each party,\nand the potential strategies for engaging with\neach party, all with a view to pursuing the\nbest reasonably available alternative for\nEaton Vance and its stockholders. Upon the\nconclusion of the discussion, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors directed management to\nconvey to representatives of Morgan Stanley\nthat Eaton Vance would commit not to pursue\ncompeting transactions for the period of time\nfor execution of a definitive merger agreement\ndescribed in the Morgan Stanley Initial\nProposal if Morgan Stanley were to increase\nthe value of its proposal to $60.00 per share\nof Eaton Vance Common Stock. Following the\nmeeting of the Eaton Vance board of directors,\nMr. Faust informed Mr. Gorman by telephone\nthat Eaton Vance would be willing to commit\nnot to pursue competing transactions for the\nperiod of time for execution of a definitive\nmerger agreement described in the Morgan\nStanley Initial Proposal if Morgan Stanley\nwere to increase the value of its proposal to\n$60.00 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock.\n\nFollowing further discussions between Mr.\nFaust and Mr. Gorman, on August 30, 2020,\nEaton Vance received from Morgan Stanley a\nrevised non-binding written proposal (the\n\u201cMorgan Stanley Second Proposal\u201d) for the\nacquisition of Eaton Vance by Morgan Stanley\nin a merger transaction at a value of $57.50\nper share of Eaton Vance Common Stock,\nfinanced with 50% cash and 50% stock, plus a\n$2.50 per share one-time cash dividend payable\nto Eaton Vance stockholders prior to the\nclosing of the proposed transaction. The\nMorgan Stanley Second Proposal indicated that\nthe consideration would consist of a fixed\ncash component and a fixed exchange ratio to\nbe set at a later date prior to execution of\nthe definitive merger agreement based on\nagreed-upon terms. The Morgan Stanley Second\nProposal also restated Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nexpectation that the E*TRADE transaction would\nclose on or around October 1, 2020 and its\ncommitment to move expeditiously to execute a\ndefinitive merger agreement with Eaton Vance\nwithin seven days after the close of the\nE*TRADE transaction. The Morgan Stanley Second\nProposal assumed that Eaton Vance would\nneither increase the amount of its regular\nquarterly dividends nor restart its common\nshare repurchase program.\n\nLater on August 30, 2020, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and a representative of WilmerHale,\nto consider the Morgan Stanley Second\nProposal. Mr. Faust reported to the Eaton\nVance board of directors on his recent\nconversations with representatives of Morgan\nStanley and restated his belief that Party A\nwas not likely to materially increase its bid\nbeyond the Party A Second Proposal. The Eaton\nVance board of directors discussed, among\nother things, the potential advantages and\ndisadvantages associated with terminating\ndiscussions with Party A and committing to a\nperiod with Morgan Stanley during which Eaton\nVance would not pursue competing transactions,\nincluding the possibility of successfully\nconcluding negotiations with Morgan Stanley\nduring such period and the possibility that,\ndue to intervening events, neither Morgan\nStanley nor Party A might be willing and able\nto proceed with a transaction if delayed until\nafter the conclusion of such period. Following\nthe discussion, and taking into account the\nrelevant facts and circumstances, including\nthe relative implied values of the competing\nproposals, the Eaton Vance board of directors\ndirected management to inform Morgan Stanley\nthat, in consideration of the Morgan Stanley\nSecond Proposal, Eaton Vance would terminate\ndiscussions with the other interested party\nand refrain from pursuing competing\ntransactions until after the period for\nexecuting a definitive agreement described in\nthe Morgan Stanley Second Proposal. Following\nthe meeting of the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors, Mr. Faust informed Mr. Gorman by\ntelephone that, in consideration of the Morgan\nStanley Second Proposal, Eaton Vance would\nterminate discussions with the other\ninterested party and not pursue competing\ntransactions until after the period for\nexecuting a definitive agreement described in\nthe Morgan Stanley Second Proposal.

Based on the closing\nmarket price per share of Party A\u2019s common\nstock on August 31, 2020, the Party A Third\nProposal implicitly valued Eaton Vance Common\nStock at $62.06 per share on that date. The\nParty A Third Proposal was conditioned on\nEaton Vance committing to negotiate\nexclusively with Party A through September 30,\n2020 and subject to completion of due\ndiligence, negotiation of a definitive\nagreement and final approval of the boards of\ndirectors of Party A and Eaton Vance.\n                      49                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nLater on August 31, 2020, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview and representatives of WilmerHale,\nto discuss the Party A Third Proposal.

Following the\ndiscussion that ensued, and after taking into\naccount the various risks, uncertainties and\nother factors deemed relevant by the Eaton\nVance board of directors, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors directed management to\npropose to Morgan Stanley that it agree to pay\na $2.00 per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nincrease in the value of the transaction\nproceeds to Eaton Vance stockholders in\nexchange for Eaton Vance\u2019s commitment, subject\nto the Eaton Vance directors\u2019 duties under\nMaryland law, to proceed toward execution of a\ndefinitive merger agreement with Morgan\nStanley on or before October 8, 2020. The\nEaton Vance board of directors also discussed\nwhat would be an acceptable response from\nMorgan Stanley.\n\nLater on October 4, 2020, Mr. Faust conveyed\nto Mr. Gorman by telephone the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors\u2019 request for a $2.00 per\nshare of Eaton Vance Common Stock price\nincrease in the value of the transaction\nproceeds to Eaton Vance stockholders versus\nthe Morgan Stanley Second Proposal.\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Mr. Gorman conveyed to Mr.\nFaust by telephone Morgan Stanley\u2019s revised\nproposal (the \u201cMorgan Stanley Third Proposal\u201d)\nto acquire Eaton Vance in a merger transaction\nat a value of $56.50 per share of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock, financed with 50% cash and 50%\nstock, plus a $4.25 per share one-time cash\ndividend payable to Eaton Vance stockholders\nprior to the closing. Mr. Faust responded by\nindicating that the Morgan Stanley Third\nProposal would be acceptable to the Eaton\nVance board of directors, authorizing Morgan\nStanley representatives to meet with the\nVoting Trustees and confirming that Eaton\nVance would work expeditiously with Morgan\nStanley to finalize and announce a definitive\nmerger agreement on or before October 8, 2020.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley led by Mr.\nGorman met by videoconference with the Voting\nTrustees later that day to review for the\nVoting Trustees Morgan Stanley\u2019s business and\norganizational plans for the combined company.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors held a special meeting by\nvideoconference, which was attended by Ms.\nHylton, Mr. Marius, representatives of\nCenterview, representatives of Houlihan Lokey,\nrepresentatives of WilmerHale and\nrepresentatives of DLA Piper. During the\nmeeting, Mr. Faust reported to the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors on the discussions with\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley since the\nmeeting of the Eaton Vance board of directors\nheld on October 4, 2020. The Eaton Vance board\nof directors then discussed with management\nand representatives of Centerview the relative\nvalues per share of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nimplied by the Morgan Stanley Third Proposal\nand the Party A Third Proposal, considering\nboth the historical returns and the\nanticipated future returns of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock and Party A common stock over the\nperiod until the closing of a potential\ntransaction between Eaton Vance and the\nrespective parties, and thereafter. The\nCenterview representatives provided the Eaton\nVance board of directors with an analysis\nshowing that the value per share of the Morgan\nStanley Third Proposal exceeded that of the\nParty A Third Proposal on approximately 70% of\ntrading days over the prior three months,\nbased on each day\u2019s closing market prices. Mr.\nFaust and other parties to the discussion\nexpressed their belief that announcement of a\ntransaction between Eaton Vance and Morgan\nStanley would likely have a more favorable\neffect on the performance of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock than announcement of a\ntransaction with Party A would have on the\nperformance of Party A common stock, and that\nthe overall prospects for Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock were likely more favorable than\nthe prospects for Party A common stock over\nthe time periods relevant to the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors\u2019 decision. Thereafter, the\nrepresentatives of Centerview reviewed their\nfinancial analysis of the Morgan Stanley Third\nProposal and of the Party A Third Proposal.\nThe representatives of Centerview were then\nexcused from the meeting and the\nrepresentatives of Houlihan Lokey joined the\nmeeting to review their financial analysis of\nthe Morgan Stanley Third Proposal.

Representatives of\nWilmerHale and DLA Piper then reviewed with\nthe Eaton Vance board of directors legal\nconsiderations, including the duties of the\nmembers of the Eaton Vance board of directors\nunder Maryland law, in connection with the\nEaton Vance board of directors\u2019 evaluation of\nthe Morgan Stanley Third Proposal and the\nParty A Third Proposal, which had an implied\nvalue of $61.41 per share of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock based on the closing market price\nper share of Party A\u2019s common stock on October\n6, 2020. After discussion, the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors concluded that a\ntransaction with Morgan Stanley on the terms\nset forth in the proposed merger agreement was\nthe best reasonably available alternative for\nEaton Vance and its stockholders and directed\nmanagement to continue efforts to execute a\ndefinitive merger agreement with Morgan\nStanley on or prior to October 8, 2020.\n                      52                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nLater on October 6, 2020, the Voting Trustees\nheld a meeting by videoconference, which was\nattended by representatives of Centerview,\nrepresentatives of Houlihan Lokey,\nrepresentatives of WilmerHale and\nrepresentatives of Gordon Feinblatt.

The Eaton       \n     Vance board of directors\u2019 belief that    \n     the Merger Consideration offered by      \n     Morgan Stanley in the Mergers and the    \n     Special Dividend, taken together,        \n     represented a compelling premium to the  \n  \u2022  market trading price of Eaton Vance      \n     Non-Voting Common Stock compared to      \n     comparable transactions, as more fully   \n     described below under \u201cThe               \n     Mergers\u2014Opinions of Eaton Vance\u2019s        \n     Financial Advisors\u201d beginning on         \n     page64of this information                \n     statement/prospectus.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Compelling Strategic Logic. The Eaton    \n     Vance board of directors\u2019 belief that    \n     the proposed transaction with Morgan     \n     Stanley is strategically compelling and  \n     that Eaton Vance\u2019s stockholders would,   \n     to the extent they receive Morgan        \n     Stanley Common Stock that is retained    \n     post-closing, benefit from being         \n     stockholders in a significantly more     \n     risk-diversified business than Eaton     \n     Vance currently maintains. The Eaton     \n     Vance board of directors also believed   \n  \u2022  that Eaton Vance\u2019s stockholders would,   \n     to the extent they retain Morgan         \n     Stanley Common Stock received as Merger  \n     Consideration, benefit from the          \n     complementary strengths of Eaton Vance   \n     and Morgan Stanley and the unique and    \n     compelling potential strategic benefits  \n     to be realized from the Mergers, such    \n     as the combined company\u2019s ability to     \n     broaden distribution access, fill        \n     product and services gaps through        \n     highly complementary offerings,          \n     increase the scale and breadth of        \n     Morgan Stanley\u2019s                         \n                                              \n55                                            \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \ninvestment management and wealth management   \nfranchises, and improve operating efficiency  \nof the combined company\u2019s investment          \nmanagement and wealth management businesses,  \nwhich are expected to position the combined   \ncompany to be an industry leader in investment\nmanagement and wealth management across       \ncustomer segments and geographic regions,     \nthereby increasing the contribution of        \ninvestment management and wealth management   \nbusinesses to the overall earnings of Morgan  \nStanley and potentially causing Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock to be afforded a higher valuation\nin the market, which higher valuation would   \nbenefit Eaton Vance stockholders who become   \nMorgan Stanley stockholders in the Mergers. To\nthe extent that the above-described or other  \nfactors cause the price of Morgan Stanley     \nCommon Stock to appreciate over the period    \nuntil the transaction closes, the value of the\nMerger Consideration \u2013 whether paid in shares \nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock, cash or a     \ncombination of both \u2013 would increase          \nfractionally in equal proportion to the       \nbenefit of all Eaton Vance stockholders.      \n                                              \n     Best Reasonably Available Alternative    \n     for Maximizing Stockholder Value. The    \n     Eaton Vance board of directors\u2019          \n     determination, after consultation with   \n     senior management and its financial and  \n     legal advisors, that entering into the   \n     Merger Agreement with Morgan Stanley     \n     was more favorable to Eaton Vance        \n  \u2022  stockholders than other alternatives     \n     reasonably available to Eaton Vance,     \n     including continued operation of Eaton   \n     Vance on a standalone basis or the       \n     pursuit of a potential alternative       \n     transaction with Party A or any other    \n     party. In making its determination, the  \n     Eaton Vance board of directors took      \n     into account a number of factors,        \n     including:                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Eaton Vance board of directors\u2019      \n     assessment of Eaton Vance\u2019s business     \n     and operations, historicalresults of     \n     operations, financial prospects and      \n     conditions, and the determination that   \n  \u25cb  continuedoperation of Eaton Vance on a   \n     standalone basis was not likely to       \n     produce, on a risk-adjusted basis,more   \n     value for Eaton Vance stockholders than  \n     the Merger Consideration offered by      \n     Morgan Stanleytaken together with the    \n     Special Dividend;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     the Eaton Vance board of directors\u2019      \n     belief as to the attractive potential    \n     to create meaningful                     \n     businessopportunities and favorable      \n     market valuation effects for Morgan      \n     Stanley as a result of combining         \n     withEaton Vance, from which Eaton Vance  \n     stockholders will have the opportunity   \n  \u25cb  to benefit (fractionallyin equal         \n     proportion for all Eaton Vance           \n     stockholders to the extent reflected in  \n     the price performanceof Morgan Stanley   \n     Common Stock prior to the closing, and   \n     thereafter fully reflected in the value  \n     ofthe Merger Consideration received in   \n     the form of Morgan Stanley Common Stock  \n     that is retained byEaton Vance           \n     stockholders post-closing);              \n                                              \n                                              \n     that, according to a backward-looking    \n     comparison (the \u201cOctober 4 Comparison\u201d)  \n     prepared byCenterview and presented to   \n     the Eaton Vance board of directors at    \n     the meeting of the Eaton Vanceboard of   \n     directors held on October 4, 2020, the   \n     value per share of Eaton Vance Common    \n     Stock impliedby the Morgan Stanley       \n     Second Proposal exceeded that of the     \n     Party A Third Proposal on                \n     approximately50% of the trading days     \n     over the three months preceding such     \n     meeting.

While Eaton Vance\u2019s         \n     business continues to present            \n     opportunities for growth, it has also    \n     become subject to increasing             \n     competitive pressures in the investment  \n     management and wealth management         \n     industries due to, among other factors,  \n     a changing competitive landscape,        \n     including the need for greater scale     \n     driven by clients and distribution       \n     partners seeking to reduce the number    \n  \u2022  of investment management and wealth      \n     management provider relationships they   \n     maintain and to extract greater value    \n     from those provider relationships. As    \n     such, there are increasing challenges    \n     to maintaining Eaton Vance\u2019s historical  \n     growth rate, profitability and           \n     valuation as a standalone company. In    \n     evaluating the Mergers, the Eaton Vance  \n     board of directors considered that       \n     there were significant risks to          \n     executing on Eaton Vance\u2019s standalone    \n     plan.                                    \n                                              \n57                                            \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \n     Market, Industry, Political, Economic    \n     and Regulatory Conditions. In            \n     evaluating the Mergers, the Eaton Vance  \n     board of directors considered the        \n     current market, industry, political,     \n     economic and regulatory conditions. In   \n     particular, the Eaton Vance board of     \n     directors noted the significant          \n     disruption in business activity and the  \n     performance of global financial markets  \n     caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the     \n     uncertain outlook for the U.S. and       \n     global capital markets, the uncertainty  \n     related to the November 2020 U.S.        \n     elections, the potential for adverse     \n  \u2022  legal, regulatory and tax law changes    \n     as a result of legislative and           \n     regulatory initiatives that may          \n     increase costs and limit Eaton Vance\u2019s   \n     ability to pursue business               \n     opportunities, the potential for         \n     reduced access to markets outside the    \n     U.S. due to restrictions on global       \n     trade or other factors, and the          \n     potential for meaningful declines in     \n     market prices of common stocks and       \n     other risk assets, which would           \n     adversely affect the revenue and         \n     profitability of Eaton Vance\u2019s           \n     investment management and wealth         \n     management businesses.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Ability of Stockholders to Elect the     \n     Form of Merger Consideration and         \n     Participate in the CombinedCompany. In   \n     evaluating the Mergers, the Eaton Vance  \n     board of directors also considered that  \n     the Merger Agreement allows Eaton Vance  \n     stockholders to elect to receive Stock   \n     Consideration or Mixed Consideration     \n     through which they could participate     \n     post-closing in the value created by     \n     the combination of Eaton Vance and       \n     Morgan Stanley and the future growth of  \n     Morgan Stanley through ownership of      \n  \u2022  Morgan Stanley Common Stock, while also  \n     permitting Eaton Vance stockholders to   \n     elect, subject to a proration and        \n     adjustment mechanism, to receive Cash    \n     Consideration upon completion of the     \n     Mergers. The structure of the Merger     \n     Agreement provides for all Eaton Vance   \n     stockholders, whether they elect to      \n     receive Stock Consideration, Mixed       \n     Consideration or Cash Consideration, to  \n     participate fractionally in equal        \n     proportion in the appreciation (or       \n     depreciation) of Morgan Stanley Common   \n     Stock over the period until the          \n     transaction closes.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Tax Status of the Transaction. The       \n     Eaton Vance board of directors           \n     considered the expected tax treatment    \n     of the Mergers for U.S. federal income   \n     tax purposes, including that it is       \n     anticipated that the transaction will    \n     not be taxable to Eaton Vance            \n  \u2022  stockholders to the extent that they     \n     receive Morgan Stanley Common Stock as   \n     consideration, as more fully described   \n     below under the section entitled \u201cThe    \n     Mergers\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax          \n     Considerations of the Mergers\u201d           \n     beginning on page82of this information   \n     statement/prospectus.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     High Likelihood of Completion. The       \n     Eaton Vance board of directors\u2019 view     \n     that the likelihood of completion of     \n     the Mergers is high, particularly in     \n     light of the terms of the Merger         \n     Agreement and the conditions to closing  \n     the Mergers, including an achievable     \n     threshold of client consents required    \n     to be obtained and the obligation of     \n     Morgan Stanley to use reasonable best    \n     efforts to obtain regulatory approvals   \n  \u2022  required to complete the Mergers and to  \n     use reasonable best efforts to resolve   \n     impediments or objections, if any,       \n     asserted by any governmental authority   \n     with respect to the Mergers in           \n     connection with obtaining all consents   \n     required to be obtained from any         \n     governmental authority, in each case     \n     subject to the limitations described     \n     under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Reasonable   \n     Best Efforts Covenant\u201d beginning on      \n     page105of this information statement     \n     statement/prospectus.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Favorable Terms in the Merger            \n     Agreement.

                              \n     That Eaton Vance was required to use     \n     its reasonable best efforts to cause     \n     delivery of the Eaton Vance Stockholder  \n     Approval by 5:00

                 \nThe Eaton Vance board of directors considered \nall of these factors as a whole and believed  \nthat, overall, the potential benefits of the  \nMergers to Eaton Vance\u2019s

The foregoing discussion of factors  \nconsidered by the Eaton Vance board of        \ndirectors is not intended to be exhaustive but\nincludes the material factors considered by   \nthe Eaton Vance board of directors. In light  \nof the variety of factors considered in       \nconnection with its evaluation of the Mergers \nand the complexity of these matters, the Eaton\nVance board of directors did not find it      \npracticable to, and did not, quantify, rank or\notherwise assign relative weights to the      \nspecific factors considered in reaching its   \ndeterminations and recommendations. Moreover, \neach member of the Eaton Vance board of       \ndirectors applied his or her own personal     \nbusiness judgment to the process and may have \nviewed factors differently or given different \nweight or merit to different factors. The     \nEaton Vance board of directors did not        \nundertake to make any specific determination  \nas to whether any factor, or any particular   \naspect of any factor, supported or did not    \nsupport its ultimate determination. The Eaton \nVance board of directors based its            \nrecommendation on the totality of the         \ninformation presented. The Eaton Vance board  \nof directors evaluated the factors described  \nabove, among others, and (i) determined that  \nthe Merger Agreement and the Mergers are in   \nthe best interests of Eaton Vance and Eaton   \nVance\u2019s stockholders, (ii) approved and       \ndeclared advisable the Mergers and the other  \ntransactions set forth in the Merger Agreement\non the terms and conditions of the Merger     \nAgreement, (iii) directed that the approval of\nthe Mergers and the other transactions on the \nterms and conditions of the Merger Agreement  \nbe submitted to the Voting Trustees, the      \nholders of the Voting Trust Receipts and the  \nVoting Trust, the sole holder of Eaton Vance  \nVoting Common Stock, for consideration, and   \n(iv) recommended the approval of the Merger   \nAgreement and the transactions set forth      \ntherein by the Voting Trustees (in their      \ncapacities as such), the holders of the Voting\nTrust Receipts (in their capacities as such)  \nand the Voting Trust.

Centerview also assumed, at Eaton\nVance\u2019s direction, that the proposed Mergers\nand the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement will be consummated on the\nterms set forth in the Merger Agreement\n(including that Eaton Vance will pay the\nSpecial Dividend in accordance with the Merger\nAgreement) and in accordance with all\napplicable laws and other relevant documents\nor requirements, without delay or the waiver,\nmodification or amendment of any term,\ncondition or agreement, the effect of which\nwould be material to Centerview\u2019s analysis or\nCenterview\u2019s opinion and that, in the course\nof obtaining the necessary governmental,\nregulatory and other approvals, consents,\nreleases and waivers for the proposed Mergers\nand the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement, no delay, limitation,\nrestriction, condition or other change,\nincluding any divestiture requirements or\namendments or modifications, will be imposed,\nthe effect of which would be material to\nCenterview\u2019s analysis or Centerview\u2019s opinion.\nCenterview further assumed, at Eaton Vance\u2019s\ndirection, that the Mergers will qualify for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes as a\nreorganization within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code. Centerview did not\nevaluate and did not express any opinion as to\nthe solvency or fair value of Eaton Vance or\nMorgan Stanley, or the ability of Eaton Vance\nor Morgan Stanley to pay their respective\nobligations when they come due, or as to the\nimpact of the proposed Mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement on such matters, under any state,\nfederal or other laws relating to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar matters.

The summary set forth below\ndoes not purport to be a complete description\nof the financial analyses performed or factors\nconsidered by, and underlying the opinion of,\nCenterview, nor does the order of the\nfinancial analyses described represent the\nrelative importance or weight given to those\nfinancial analyses by Centerview. Centerview\nmay have deemed various assumptions more or\nless probable than other assumptions, so the\nreference ranges resulting from any particular\nportion of the analyses summarized below\nshould not be taken to be Centerview\u2019s view of\nthe actual value of Eaton Vance. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses set forth\nbelow include information presented in tabular\nformat. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses, the tables must be read\ntogether with the text of each summary, as the\ntables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses\nperformed by Centerview. Considering the data\nin the tables below without considering all\nfinancial analyses or factors or the full\nnarrative description of such analyses or\nfactors, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying such analyses or\nfactors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying\nCenterview\u2019s financial analyses and its\nopinion. In performing its analyses,\nCenterview made numerous assumptions with\nrespect to industry performance, general\nbusiness and economic conditions and other\nmatters, many of which are beyond the control\nof Eaton Vance or any other parties to the\nproposed Mergers and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. None of\nEaton Vance, Morgan Stanley, Merger Sub 1,\nMerger Sub 2 or Centerview or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are\nmaterially different from those discussed. Any\nestimates contained in these analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or\npredictive of future results or values, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable\nthan as set forth below. In addition, analyses\nrelating to the value of Eaton Vance do not\npurport to be appraisals or reflect the prices\nat which Eaton Vance may actually be sold.\nAccordingly, the assumptions and estimates\nused in, and the results derived from, the\nfinancial analyses are inherently subject to\n                      66                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nsubstantial uncertainty. Except as otherwise  \nnoted, the following quantitative information,\nto the extent that it is based on market data,\nis based on market data as it existed on or   \nbefore October 7, 2020 (the last trading day  \nbefore the public announcement of the proposed\nMergers and the other transactions            \ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement) and is  \nnot necessarily indicative of current market  \nconditions. Selected Public Company Analysis  \nCenterview reviewed and compared certain      \nfinancial information, ratios and multiples   \nfor Eaton Vance to corresponding financial    \ninformation, ratios and multiples for publicly\ntraded companies that Centerview deemed       \ncomparable, based on its experience and       \nprofessional judgment, to Eaton Vance, which  \nselected publicly traded companies we refer to\nin this summary of Centerview\u2019s opinion as the\n\u201cselected companies\u201d. The selected companies  \nconsisted of:                                 \n                                      \n  \u2022  Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.  \n                                      \n                                   \n  \u2022  AllianceBernstein Holding LP  \n                                   \n                                              \n  \u2022  Artisan Partners Asset Management, Inc.  \n                                              \n                      \n  \u2022  BlackRock, Inc.  \n                      \n                           \n  \u2022  Cohen & Steers, Inc.  \n                           \n                             \n  \u2022  Federated Hermes, Inc.  \n                             \n                               \n  \u2022  Franklin Resources, Inc.  \n                               \n                   \n  \u2022  Invesco Ltd.  \n                   \n                                \n  \u2022  Janus Henderson Group PLC  \n                                \n                                \n  \u2022  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.  \n                                \nAlthough none of the selected companies is    \ndirectly comparable to Eaton Vance, these     \ncompanies were selected, among other reasons, \nbecause they are publicly traded companies    \nwith certain operational and financial        \ncharacteristics, which, for purposes of its   \nanalyses, Centerview considered to be similar \nto those of Eaton Vance. However, because none\nof the selected companies is exactly the same \nas Eaton Vance, Centerview believed that it   \nwas inappropriate to, and therefore did not,  \nrely solely on the quantitative results of the\nselected public company analysis. Accordingly,\nCenterview also made qualitative judgments,   \nbased on its experience and professional      \njudgment, concerning differences between the  \nbusiness, financial and operating             \ncharacteristics and prospects of Eaton Vance  \nand the selected companies that could affect  \nthe public trading values of each in order to \nprovide a context in which to consider the    \nresults of the quantitative analysis. Using   \npublicly available information obtained from  \nSEC filings and other data sources and closing\nstock prices as of October 7, 2020 (but in the\ncase of Janus Henderson Group PLC and Invesco \nLtd., as of October 1, 2020, the last trading \nday prior to the disclosure of Trian Partners\u2019\nstake in each of these companies with a view  \nof a potential business combination and, in   \nthe case of Franklin Resources, Inc., based on\nselected research analysts who have disclosed \npro forma metrics following the closing of    \nFranklin Resources, Inc.\u2019s acquisition of Legg\nMason, Inc.), Centerview calculated, for each \nselected company the following ratios and     \nmultiples: (i) such company\u2019s enterprise value\n(calculated as the equity value (determined   \nusing the treasury stock method and taking    \ninto account outstanding in-the-money options,\nwarrants, restricted stock units and other    \nconvertible securities) plus the face value of\ndebt and certain liabilities less cash and    \ncash equivalents and certain other            \ninvestments) as a multiple of Wall Street     \nresearch analyst consensus estimated earnings \nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and      \namortization, or EBITDA, for calendar year    \n2021 and (ii) the ratio of such company\u2019s     \nstock price to Wall Street research analyst   \nconsensus estimated earnings per share, or EPS\n(a ratio commonly referred to as a price to   \nearnings ratio, or P/E), for calendar year    \n2021. These analyses resulted in a median     \nmultiple of enterprise value to 2021 calendar \nyear estimated EBITDA of 7.5x and a median    \nratio of closing stock price to 2021 calendar \nyear estimated EPS of 9.0x, in each case, for \nsuch selected companies. Based on its         \nexperience and professional judgment, for     \npurposes of its analysis, Centerview selected \nreference ranges of multiples of enterprise   \nvalue to 2021 calendar year estimated EBITDA  \nof 7.0x to 9.5x and ratios of closing stock   \nprice to 2021 calendar year estimated EPS of  \n9.0x to 14.0x. In selecting these reference   \nranges, Centerview made qualitative judgments \nbased on its experience and professional      \njudgment concerning differences between the   \n                                              \n67                                            \n                                              \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nbusiness, financial and operating             \ncharacteristics of Eaton Vance and the        \nselected companies that could affect their    \npublic trading values in order to provide a   \ncontext in which to consider the results of   \nthe quantitative analysis. Centerview applied \nthe EBITDA multiple reference range to Eaton  \nVance\u2019s calendar year 2021 estimated adjusted \nEBITDA as set forth in the Internal Data to   \nderive a range of implied enterprise values   \nfor Eaton Vance. Centerview subtracted from   \nthis range of implied enterprise values the   \nface value of Eaton Vance\u2019s net debt as of    \nJuly 31, 2020 as set forth in the Internal    \nData to derive a range of implied equity      \nvalues for Eaton Vance. Centerview then       \ndivided these implied equity values by the    \nnumber of fully-diluted outstanding shares of \nEaton Vance Common Stock as of October 7, 2020\nas set forth in the Internal Data to derive a \nrange of implied per share equity values for  \neach share of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common   \nStock. Centerview also applied the EPS        \nmultiple reference range to Eaton Vance\u2019s     \ncalendar year 2021 estimated adjusted EPS of  \n$3.64 per share of Eaton Vance Non-Voting     \nCommon Stock as set forth in the Internal Data\nto derive a range of implied per share equity \nvalues for each share of Eaton Vance Non-     \nVoting Common Stock. The results of this      \nanalyses are summarized as follows: based on  \nEaton Vance\u2019s 2021 calendar year estimated    \noperating EBITDA, as set forth in the Internal\nData, Centerview calculated an implied per    \nshare equity value range for each share of    \nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock of        \napproximately $37.21 to $48.98, and based on  \nEaton Vance\u2019s 2021 calendar year estimated    \noperating EPS, as set forth in the Internal   \nData, Centerview calculated an implied per    \nshare equity value range for each share of    \nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock of        \napproximately $32.76 to $50.97. Centerview    \nthen compared these ranges to the implied     \nvalue of the Merger Consideration of $60.91   \nper share of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common    \nStock based on a cash consideration of $28.25 \nper share, a Special Dividend of $4.25 per    \nshare, and $28.41 stock consideration per     \nshare (based upon an exchange ratio of 0.5833 \nand the closing price of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock as of October 7, 2020), to be paid to   \nthe holders of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common  \nStock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement. Selected Transaction    \nAnalysis Centerview reviewed and compared     \ncertain information relating to the following \nselected transactions involving publicly      \ntraded asset management companies (which are  \nreferred to as the \u201cselected transactions\u201d in \nthis Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis)\nthat Centerview, based on its experience and  \nprofessional judgment, deemed relevant to     \nconsider in relation to Eaton Vance and the   \nproposed Mergers and the other transactions   \ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement.         \n                                              \n  Date           Target           Acquiror    \n  Announced                                   \n  February       Legg Mason,      Franklin    \n  2020           Inc.

However, because none of the  \nselected transactions used in this analysis is\nidentical or directly comparable to the       \nproposed Mergers and the other transactions   \ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement,         \nCenterview believed that it was inappropriate \nto, and therefore did not, rely solely on the \nquantitative results of the selected precedent\ntransaction analysis. Accordingly, Centerview \nalso made qualitative judgments, based on its \nexperience and professional judgment,         \nconcerning differences between the            \noperational, business or financial            \ncharacteristics of Eaton Vance and each target\ncompany as well as the proposed Mergers and   \nthe other transactions contemplated by the    \nMerger Agreement and the selected transactions\nthat could affect the transaction values of   \neach in order to provide a context in which to\nconsider the results of the quantitative      \nanalysis.                                     \n                                              \n68                                            \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nUsing publicly available information obtained\nfrom SEC filings and other data sources,\nCenterview calculated, for each selected\ntransaction, among other things, the\nenterprise value implied for the applicable\ntarget company based on the consideration\npayable in the applicable selected\ntransactions, as a multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s EBITDA for the most recently ended\ntwelve months prior to the announcement of\nsuch selected transaction, or LTM EBITDA. This\nanalysis resulted in a median multiple of\nenterprise value to LTM EBITDA of 9.8x for\nsuch selected transactions.\n\nBased on its analysis and other considerations\nthat Centerview deemed relevant in its\nprofessional judgment and experience,\nCenterview selected a reference range of\nmultiples of enterprise value to LTM EBITDA of\n8.0x to 11.0x. In selecting this range,\nCenterview made qualitative judgments based on\nits experience and professional judgment\nconcerning differences between the business,\nfinancial and operating characteristics and\nprospects of Eaton Vance and the companies\nincluded in the selected transactions as well\nas the proposed Mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement and the selected transactions and\nother factors that could affect each\ntransaction or the public trading, acquisition\nor other values of such companies or Eaton\nVance in order to provide a context in which\nto consider the results of the quantitative\nanalysis.\n\nCenterview applied this reference range to\nEaton Vance\u2019s LTM EBITDA, as set forth in the\nInternal Data, to derive a range of implied\nenterprise values for Eaton Vance. Centerview\nsubtracted from this range of implied\nenterprise values the face value of Eaton\nVance\u2019s net debt as of July\u00a031, 2020 as set\nforth in the Internal Data to derive a range\nof implied equity values for Eaton Vance.\nCenterview then divided these implied equity\nvalues by the number of fully-diluted\noutstanding shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nas of October\u00a07, 2020 as set forth in the\nInternal Data to derive a range of implied per\nshare equity value for each share of Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock of approximately\n$39.17 to $52.10. Centerview then compared\nthis range to the implied value of the Merger\nConsideration of $60.91 per share of Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock based on a cash\nconsideration of $28.25 per share, a Special\nDividend of $4.25 per share, and $28.41 stock\nconsideration per share (based upon an\nexchange ratio of 0.5833 and the closing price\nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock as of\nOctober\u00a07, 2020) to be paid to the holders of\nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock (other\nthan Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\n                                              \n   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis              \n                                              \nCenterview performed a discounted cash flow\nanalysis of Eaton Vance based on the\nForecasts, which is a traditional valuation\nmethodology used to derive a valuation of an\nasset by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of\nestimated future cash flows of the asset.\n\u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of\nfuture cash flows and is obtained by\ndiscounting those future cash flows by a\ndiscount rate that takes into account\nmacroeconomic assumptions and estimates of\nrisk, the opportunity cost of capital,\nexpected returns and other appropriate\nfactors.\n\nIn performing this analysis, Centerview\ncalculated a range of illustrative equity\nvalues for Eaton Vance by applying a discount\nrate range of 10.0% to 11.0% (reflecting\nCenterview\u2019s analysis of Eaton Vance\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital) and the mid-\nyear convention to (a) Eaton Vance\u2019s\nmanagement plan forecast as of June\u00a011, 2020\nof after-tax unlevered free cash flows of\nEaton Vance for the fiscal quarter ending\nOctober\u00a031, 2020 and for the fiscal years 2021\nthrough 2025 utilizing the Forecasts at the\ndirection of Eaton Vance and assumptions\ndiscussed with Eaton Vance management and (b)\na range of illustrative terminal values for\nEaton Vance, calculated by Centerview applying\nperpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to\n2.0%, which Centerview selected based on its\nprofessional judgment, to Eaton Vance\u2019s after-\ntax unlevered free cash flows for the terminal\nyear. Centerview then divided these implied\nequity values by the number of fully-diluted\noutstanding share of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nas of October\u00a07, 2020 as set forth in the\nInternal Data to derive a range of implied per\nshare equity value for each share of Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock of approximately\n$49.94 to $60.04. Centerview then compared\nthis range to the implied value of the Merger\nConsideration of $60.91 per share of Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock based on a cash\nconsideration of $28.25 per share, a Special\nDividend of $4.25 per share, and $28.41 stock\nconsideration per share (based upon an\nexchange ratio of 0.5833 and the closing price\nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock as of\nOctober\u00a07, 2020) to be paid to the holders of\nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock (other\nthan Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\n                      69                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOther Factors Centerview noted for the Eaton  \nVance board of directors certain additional   \nfactors solely for informational purposes,    \nincluding, among other things, the following: \n                                              \n     Historical Stock Price Trading           \n     Analysis. Centerview reviewed the        \n     historical closing trading prices of     \n     the Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock  \n  \u2022  for the 52-week period prior to October  \n     7, 2020, which reflected low and high    \n     closing trading prices during such       \n     52-week period of $23.76 to $51.68 per   \n     share of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common   \n     Stock.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Analyst Price Target Analysis.           \n     Centerview reviewed stock price targets  \n     for the Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common    \n     Stock reflected in publicly available    \n  \u2022  Wall Street research analyst reports as  \n     of October\u00a07, 2020, which indicated low  \n     and high analyst stock price targets     \n     ranging from $35.00 to $50.00 per share  \n     of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock.  \n                                              \nGeneral The preparation of a financial opinion\nis a complex analytical process involving     \nvarious determinations as to the most         \nappropriate and relevant methods of financial \nanalysis and the application of those methods \nto the particular circumstances and,          \ntherefore, a financial opinion is not readily \nsusceptible to summary description. In        \narriving at its opinion, Centerview did not   \ndraw, in isolation, conclusions from or with  \nregard to any factor or analysis that it      \nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its       \ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of  \nits experience and professional judgment after\nconsidering the results of all of the         \nanalyses. Centerview\u2019s financial analyses and \nopinion were only one of many factors taken   \ninto consideration by the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors in its evaluation of the proposed   \nMergers and the other transactions            \ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement.         \nConsequently, the analyses described above    \nshould not be viewed as determinative of the  \nviews of the Eaton Vance board of directors or\nmanagement of Eaton Vance with respect to the \nMerger Consideration or as to whether the     \nEaton Vance board of directors would have been\nwilling to determine that a different         \nconsideration was fair. The consideration for \nthe proposed Mergers and the other            \ntransactions contemplated by the Merger       \nAgreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length \nnegotiations between Eaton Vance and Morgan   \nStanley and was approved by the Eaton Vance   \nboard of directors. Centerview provided advice\nto Eaton Vance during these negotiations.     \nCenterview did not, however recommend any     \nspecific amount of consideration to Eaton     \nVance or the Eaton Vance board of directors or\nthat any specific amount of consideration     \nconstituted the only appropriate consideration\nfor the proposed Mergers and the other        \ntransactions contemplated by the Merger       \nAgreement. Centerview is a securities firm    \nengaged directly and through affiliates and   \nrelated persons in a number of investment     \nbanking, financial advisory and merchant      \nbanking activities. In the two years prior to \nthe date of its written opinion, Centerview   \nhas been engaged to provide financial advisory\nservices to Eaton Vance, including in         \nconnection with various strategic matters, and\nCenterview received approximately $250,000 in \ncompensation from Eaton Vance for such        \nservices. In the two years prior to the date  \nof its written opinion, Centerview has not    \nbeen engaged to provide financial advisory or \nother services to Morgan Stanley, and         \nCenterview has not received any compensation  \nfrom Morgan Stanley during such period.       \nCenterview may provide financial advisory and \nother services to or with respect to Eaton    \nVance or Morgan Stanley or their respective   \naffiliates in the future, for which Centerview\nmay receive compensation.

The     \nEaton Vance board of directors selected       \nCenterview as its financial advisor in        \nconnection with the proposed Mergers and the  \nother transactions contemplated by the Merger \nAgreement based on Centerview\u2019s               \nqualifications, professional reputation and   \nindustry expertise.

In addition, Eaton Vance has agreed\nto reimburse certain of Centerview\u2019s expenses \narising, and to indemnify Centerview against  \ncertain liabilities that may arise, out of    \nCenterview\u2019s engagement.

On October 7, 2020,       \nHoulihan Lokey verbally rendered its opinion  \nto the Eaton Vance board of directors (which  \nwas subsequently confirmed in writing by      \ndelivery of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s written opinion  \naddressed to the Eaton Vance board of         \ndirectors dated October 7, 2020), as of such  \ndate and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations \nset forth in its written opinion, and taking  \ninto account the Special Dividend, the Merger \nConsideration (which for purposes of Houlihan \nLokey\u2019s opinion means the cash and shares of  \nMorgan Stanley Common Stock to be received in \nthe Mixed Consideration, the Cash             \nConsideration and the Stock Consideration,    \ntaken in the aggregate) to be received by the \nholders of Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock\n(other than Morgan Stanley and affiliates of  \nEaton Vance) in the First Merger pursuant to  \nthe Merger Agreement was fair to such holders \nfrom a financial point of view. Houlihan      \nLokey\u2019s opinion was directed to the Eaton     \nVance board of directors (in its capacity as  \nsuch) and only addressed the fairness, from a \nfinancial point of view, taking into account  \nthe Special Dividend, of the Merger           \nConsideration to be received by the holders of\nEaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock (other    \nthan Morgan Stanley and affiliates of Eaton   \nVance) in the First Merger pursuant to the    \nMerger Agreement, and did not address any     \nother aspect or implication of the Mergers or \nany other agreement, arrangement or           \nunderstanding.

In addition,  \nmanagement of Eaton Vance advised Houlihan    \nLokey, and Houlihan Lokey assumed, that the   \nEaton Vance Forecasts reviewed by Houlihan    \nLokey were reasonably prepared in good faith  \non bases reflecting the best currently        \navailable estimates and judgments of such     \nmanagement as to the future financial results \nand condition of Eaton Vance and the other    \nmatters covered thereby, and Houlihan Lokey   \nexpressed no opinion with respect to such     \nprojections or the assumptions on which they  \nwere based. As the Eaton Vance board of       \ndirectors was aware, Houlihan Lokey was not   \nprovided with access to the management of, or \nadvisors to, Morgan Stanley, and did not have \naccess to financial forecasts relating to     \nMorgan Stanley prepared by the management of  \nMorgan Stanley. Houlihan Lokey assumed that,  \nwere Houlihan Lokey to have had access to     \nMorgan Stanley and its advisors, any          \ninformation received from such parties would  \nnot have materially affected or changed       \nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion. With respect to the \npublicly available research analyst estimates \nfor Morgan Stanley referred to above, Houlihan\nLokey reviewed and discussed such estimates   \nwith the management of Eaton Vance, and       \nHoulihan Lokey assumed that such estimates    \nwere a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate\nthe future financial performance of Morgan    \nStanley. Houlihan Lokey expressed no opinion  \nwith respect to such estimates or the         \nassumptions on which they were based. Houlihan\nLokey relied upon and assumed, without        \nindependent verification, that there was no   \nchange in the businesses, assets, liabilities,\nfinancial condition, results of operations,   \ncash flows or prospects of Eaton Vance or     \nMorgan Stanley since the respective dates of  \nthe most recent financial statements and other\ninformation, financial or otherwise, provided \nto Houlihan Lokey that would be material to   \nits analyses or its opinion, and that there   \nwas no information or any facts that would    \nmake any of the information reviewed by       \nHoulihan Lokey incomplete or misleading.      \nHoulihan Lokey relied upon and assumed,       \nwithout independent verification, that (a) the\nrepresentations and warranties of all parties \nto the Merger Agreement and all other related \ndocuments and instruments that were referred  \nto therein are true and correct, (b) each     \nparty to the Merger Agreement and such other  \nrelated documents and instruments would fully \nand timely perform all of the covenants and   \nagreements required to be performed by such   \nparty, (c) all conditions to the consummation \nof the Mergers would be satisfied without     \nwaiver thereof, and (d) the Mergers would be  \nconsummated in a timely manner and the Special\nDividend would be declared and paid, in each  \ncase in accordance with the terms described in\nthe Merger Agreement and such other related   \ndocuments and instruments, without any        \namendments or modifications thereto. At the   \nEaton Vance board of directors\u2019 direction,    \nHoulihan Lokey assumed for purposes of its    \nopinion that the Eaton Vance Voting Common    \nStock and the Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common   \nStock have equivalent economic value,         \nnotwithstanding the different voting rights   \nand other non-financial terms of such shares  \nthat could impact their respective values, and\ndisregarded the individual circumstances of   \nspecific security holders with respect to     \ncontrol, voting or other rights, aspects or   \nrelationships which may distinguish such      \nholders. Houlihan Lokey also assumed, with the\nconsent of Eaton Vance, that the Mergers,     \ntaken together as an integrated transaction,  \nwill qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the \nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.        \nHoulihan Lokey relied upon and assumed,       \nwithout independent verification, that (i) the\nMergers would be consummated and the Special  \nDividend would be declared and paid, in each  \ncase, in a manner that complies in all        \nrespects with all applicable foreign, federal \nand state statutes, rules and regulations, and\n(ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other  \nconsents and approvals necessary for the      \nconsummation of the Mergers and the           \ndeclaration and payment of the Special        \nDividend would be obtained and that no delay, \nlimitations, restrictions or conditions would \nbe imposed or amendments, modifications or    \nwaivers made that would result in the         \ndisposition of any assets of Eaton Vance or   \nMorgan Stanley, or otherwise have an effect on\nthe Mergers, the Special Dividend, Eaton Vance\nor Morgan Stanley or any expected benefits of \nthe Mergers that would be material to Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s analyses or its opinion. Houlihan     \nLokey also relied upon and assumed, without   \nindependent verification, at the direction of \nEaton Vance, that any adjustments to the      \nMerger Consideration pursuant to the Merger   \nAgreement would                               \n                                              \n72                                            \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nnot be material to Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses\nor its opinion, and Houlihan Lokey expressed\nno opinion with respect to such adjustments.\nIn addition, Houlihan Lokey relied upon and\nassumed, without independent verification,\nthat the final form of the Merger Agreement\nwould not differ in any respect from the draft\nof the Merger Agreement identified above.\n\nFurthermore, in connection with Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not\nrequested to make, and did not make, any\nphysical inspection or independent appraisal\nor evaluation of any of the assets, properties\nor liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative,\noff-balance-sheet or otherwise) of Eaton\nVance, Morgan Stanley or any other party, nor\nwas Houlihan Lokey provided with any such\nappraisal or evaluation. Houlihan Lokey did\nnot estimate, and expressed no opinion\nregarding, the liquidation value of any entity\nor business. Houlihan Lokey undertook no\nindependent analysis of any potential or\nactual litigation, regulatory action, possible\nunasserted claims or other contingent\nliabilities, to which Eaton Vance or Morgan\nStanley was or may be a party or was or may be\nsubject, or of any governmental investigation\nof any possible unasserted claims or other\ncontingent liabilities to which Eaton Vance or\nMorgan Stanley was or may be a party or was or\nmay be subject.\n\nHoulihan Lokey was not requested to, and did\nnot, (a) initiate or participate in any\ndiscussions or negotiations with, or solicit\nany indications of interest from, third\nparties with respect to the Mergers, the\nsecurities, assets, businesses or operations\nof Eaton Vance or any other party, or any\nalternatives to the Mergers or the Special\nDividend, (b) negotiate the terms of the\nMergers or the Special Dividend, or (c) advise\nthe Eaton Vance board of directors or any\nother party with respect to alternatives to\nthe Mergers or the Special Dividend. Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on\nfinancial, economic, market and other\nconditions as in effect on, and the\ninformation made available to Houlihan Lokey\nas of, the date of its opinion. Houlihan Lokey\ndid not undertake, and is under no obligation,\nto update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its\nopinion, or otherwise comment on or consider\nevents occurring or coming to Houlihan Lokey\u2019s\nattention after the date thereof. Houlihan\nLokey did not express any opinion as to what\nthe value of the Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nactually would be when issued pursuant to the\nFirst Merger or the price or range of prices\nat which the shares of the Eaton Vance Non-\nVoting Common Stock or the Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock may be purchased or sold, or\notherwise be transferable, at any time.\nHoulihan Lokey assumed that the shares of the\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock to be issued in\nthe First Merger to the stockholders of Eaton\nVance would be listed on the NYSE.\n\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was furnished for the\nuse of the Eaton Vance board of directors\n(solely in its capacity as such) in connection\nwith its evaluation of the Mergers and may not\nbe used for any other purpose without Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s prior written consent. Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion was not intended to be, and\ndid not constitute, a recommendation to the\nEaton Vance board of directors, any security\nholder or any other party as to how to act or\nvote or make any election with respect to any\nmatter relating to the Mergers, the Special\nDividend or otherwise, including, without\nlimitation, whether the holders of the Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock should elect to\nreceive the Mixed Consideration, the Cash\nConsideration, or the Stock Consideration.\n\nHoulihan Lokey was not requested to opine as\nto, and its opinion did not express an opinion\nas to or otherwise address, among other\nthings: (i)\u00a0the underlying business decision\nof the Eaton Vance board of directors, Eaton\nVance, its security holders or any other party\nto proceed with or effect the Mergers or to\ndeclare and pay the Special Dividend, (ii)\u00a0the\nterms of any arrangements, understandings,\nagreements or documents related to, or the\nform, structure or any other portion or aspect\nof, the Mergers, the Special Dividend or\notherwise (other than the Merger Consideration\nto the extent expressly specified in its\nopinion), including, without limitation, the\nfairness of the Merger Consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of the Eaton Vance\nVoting Common Stock, the fairness of the\naggregate Merger Consideration to be received\nby the holders of the Eaton Vance Voting\nCommon Stock and the holders of the Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock, or the fairness\nof the Merger Consideration to be received by\nany individual holder of the Eaton Vance Non-\nVoting Common Stock as a result of any\nelection made or deemed to have been made by\nsuch holder or as a result of the proration\nprocedures set forth in the Merger Agreement,\n(iii)\u00a0the fairness of any portion or aspect of\nthe Mergers to the holders of any class of\nsecurities, creditors or other constituencies\nof Eaton Vance, or to any other party, except\nif and only to the extent expressly set forth\nin the last sentence of its opinion, (iv)\u00a0the\nrelative merits of the Mergers and the Special\nDividend as compared to any alternative\nbusiness strategies or transactions that might\nbe available for Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley\nor any other party, (v)\u00a0the fairness of any\nportion or aspect of the Mergers to any one\nclass or group of Eaton Vance\u2019s or any other\nparty\u2019s security holders or other constituents\nvis-\u00e0-vis any other class or group of Eaton\nVance\u2019s or such other party\u2019s security holders\nor other constituents (including, without\nlimitation, the fairness of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of\nthe Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock\nrelative to the Merger Consideration to be\nreceived\n                      73                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nby the holders of the Eaton Vance Voting\nCommon Stock, or vice versa, the fairness to\nthe holders of the Eaton Vance Non-Voting\nCommon Stock of the Merger Consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of the Eaton Vance\nVoting Common Stock, or vice versa, the\nfairness of the allocation of the Merger\nConsideration between the holders of the Eaton\nVance Voting Common Stock and the holders of\nthe Eaton Vance Non-Voting Common Stock, or\nthe fairness of the consideration to be\nreceived in the Mixed Consideration, the Cash\nConsideration or the Stock Consideration\nrelative to the consideration to be received\nin any other election), (vi)\u00a0whether or not\nEaton Vance, Morgan Stanley, their respective\nsecurity holders or any other party is\nreceiving or paying reasonably equivalent\nvalue in the Mergers, (vii)\u00a0the solvency,\ncreditworthiness or fair value of Eaton Vance,\nMorgan Stanley or any other participant in the\nMergers, or any of their respective assets,\nunder any applicable laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance\nor similar matters as a result of the Mergers,\nthe Special Dividend or otherwise, or\n(viii)\u00a0the fairness, financial or otherwise,\nof the amount, nature or any other aspect of\nany compensation to or consideration payable\nto or received by any officers, directors or\nemployees of any party to the Mergers, any\nclass of such persons or any other party,\nrelative to the Merger Consideration or\notherwise. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or\ninterpretation was intended in matters that\nrequire legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or\nother similar professional advice. It is\nassumed that such opinions, counsel or\ninterpretations were or will be obtained from\nthe appropriate professional sources.\nFurthermore, Houlihan Lokey relied, with the\nconsent of the Eaton Vance board of directors,\non the assessments by the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors, Eaton Vance and its advisors, as to\nall legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and\nother similar matters with respect to Eaton\nVance, the Mergers and the Special Dividend or\notherwise.\n\nIn performing its analyses, Houlihan Lokey\nconsidered general business, economic,\nindustry and market conditions, financial and\notherwise, and other matters as they existed\non, and could be evaluated as of, the date of\nits opinion. No company, transaction or\nbusiness used in Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses for\ncomparative purposes is identical to Eaton\nVance, Morgan Stanley or the proposed Mergers\nand an evaluation of the results of those\nanalyses is not entirely mathematical. As a\nconsequence, mathematical derivations (such as\nthe high, low, mean and median) of financial\ndata are not by themselves meaningful and in\nselecting the ranges of multiples to be\napplied were considered in conjunction with\nexperience and the exercise of judgment. The\nestimates contained in the financial forecasts\nprepared by the management of Eaton Vance and\nthe implied reference range values indicated\nby Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual values or\npredictive of future results or values, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable\nthan those suggested by the analyses. In\naddition, any analyses relating to the value\nof assets, businesses or securities do not\npurport to be appraisals or to reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities\nactually may be sold, which may depend on a\nvariety of factors, many of which are beyond\nthe control of Eaton Vance. Much of the\ninformation used in, and accordingly the\nresults of, Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\n\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was only one of many\nfactors considered by the Eaton Vance board of\ndirectors in evaluating the proposed Mergers.\nNeither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion nor its\nanalyses were determinative of the Merger\nConsideration or of the views of the Eaton\nVance board of directors or management with\nrespect to the Mergers or the Merger\nConsideration. Under the terms of its\nengagement by Eaton Vance, neither Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion nor any other advice or\nservices rendered by it in connection with the\nproposed Mergers or otherwise, should be\nconstrued as creating, and Houlihan Lokey\nshould not be deemed to have, any fiduciary\nduty to, or agency relationships with, the\nEaton Vance board of directors, Eaton Vance,\nMorgan Stanley, any security holder or\ncreditor of Eaton Vance or Morgan Stanley or\nany other person, regardless of any prior or\nongoing advice or relationships. The type and\namount of consideration payable in the First\nMerger was determined through negotiation\nbetween Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley, and\nthe decision to enter into the Merger\nAgreement was solely that of the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors.\n                                              \n   Financial Analyses                         \n                                              \nIn preparing its opinion to the Eaton Vance\nboard of directors, Houlihan Lokey performed a\nvariety of analyses, including those described\nbelow. The summary of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s\nanalyses is not a complete description of the\nanalyses underlying Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion.\nThe preparation of such an opinion is a\ncomplex process involving various quantitative\nand qualitative judgments and determinations\nwith respect to the financial, comparative and\nother analytical methods employed and the\nadaptation and application of these methods to\nthe unique facts and circumstances presented.\nAs a consequence, neither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s\nopinion nor its underlying analyses is readily\nsusceptible to summary description. Houlihan\nLokey arrived at its opinion based on the\nresults of all analyses undertaken by it and\nassessed as a whole and did not draw, in\nisolation, conclusions from or with regard to\nany individual analysis, methodology or\nfactor. While the results of each analysis\nwere taken into account in reaching Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s overall conclusion with respect to\nfairness, Houlihan Lokey did not make separate\nor quantifiable\n                      74                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \njudgments regarding individual analyses.      \nAccordingly, Houlihan Lokey believes that its \nanalyses and the following summary must be    \nconsidered as a whole and that selecting      \nportions of its analyses, methodologies and   \nfactors, without considering all analyses,    \nmethodologies and factors, could create a     \nmisleading or incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses and      \nopinion. Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses were       \nnecessarily based on business, financial,     \neconomic, market and other conditions as in   \neffect on, and the information made available \nto Houlihan Lokey as of, the date of Houlihan \nLokey\u2019s opinion. There is significant         \nuncertainty as to the potential direct and    \nindirect business, financial, economic and    \nmarket implications and consequences of the   \nspread of the coronavirus and associated      \nillnesses and the actions and measures that   \ncountries, central banks, international       \nfinancing and funding organizations, stock    \nmarkets, businesses and individuals may take  \nto address the spread of the coronavirus and  \nassociated illnesses including, without       \nlimitation, those actions and measures        \npertaining to fiscal and monetary policies,   \nlegal and regulatory matters and the credit,  \nfinancial and stock markets (collectively, the\n\u201cPandemic Effects\u201d), and the Pandemic Effects \ncould have a material impact on Houlihan      \nLokey\u2019s analyses. The following is a summary  \nof the material financial analyses performed  \nby Houlihan Lokey in connection with the      \npreparation of its opinion and reviewed with  \nthe Eaton Vance board of directors on October \n7, 2020. The order of the analyses does not   \nrepresent relative importance or weight given \nto those analyses by Houlihan Lokey. The      \nanalyses summarized below include information \npresented in tabular format. The tables alone \ndo not constitute a complete description of   \nthe analyses. Considering the data in the     \ntables below without considering the full     \nnarrative description of the analyses, as well\nas the methodologies underlying, and the      \nassumptions, qualifications and limitations   \naffecting, each analysis, could create a      \nmisleading or incomplete view of Houlihan     \nLokey\u2019s analyses. For purposes of its         \nanalyses, Houlihan Lokey reviewed a number of \nfinancial and operating metrics, including:   \n                                              \n     Enterprise Value \u2014 generally, the value  \n     as of a specified date of the relevant   \n     company\u2019s outstanding equity securities  \n     (taking into account outstanding         \n     options and other securities             \n     convertible, exercisable or              \n     exchangeable into or for equity          \n  \u2022  securities of the company) plus the      \n     amount of its net debt (the amount of    \n     its outstanding indebtedness,            \n     non-convertible preferred stock,         \n     capital lease obligations and            \n     non-controlling interests less the       \n     amount of cash and cash equivalents and  \n     investments on its balance sheet).       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Equity Market Value \u2014 generally, the     \n     value as of a specified date of the      \n     relevant company\u2019s outstanding equity    \n  \u2022  securities (taking into account          \n     outstanding options and other            \n     securities convertible, exercisable or   \n     exchangeable into or for equity          \n     securities of the company).              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Adjusted EBITDA \u2014 generally, the amount  \n     of the relevant company\u2019s earnings       \n  \u2022  before interest, taxes, depreciation     \n     and amortization for a specified time    \n     period, adjusted for certain             \n     non-recurring items.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Adjusted Net Income \u2014 generally, is      \n  \u2022  calculated as net income available to    \n     common shareholders, adjusted for        \n     certain non-recurring items.             \n                                              \nUnless the context indicates otherwise,       \nenterprise values and equity values used in   \nthe selected companies analysis described     \nbelow were calculated using the closing price \nof Eaton Vance Common Stock and the common    \nstock of the selected companies listed below  \nas of October 6, 2020, and transaction values \nfor the selected transactions analysis        \ndescribed below were calculated on an         \nenterprise value basis based on the announced \ntransaction equity price and other public     \ninformation available at the time of the      \nannouncement. The estimates of the future     \nfinancial and operating performance of Eaton  \nVance relied upon for the financial analyses  \ndescribed below were based on the Eaton Vance \nForecasts.

The shares of Eaton Vance\nNon-Voting Common Stock are listed on the\nNYSE. In addition, holders of shares of Eaton\nVance Non-Voting Common Stock may not exercise\nappraisal rights under the MGCL in connection\nwith the Mergers because shares of Eaton Vance\nNon-Voting Common Stock were not entitled to\nvote on the Mergers. In addition, because the\nVoting Trust, as the sole equityholder of\nEaton Vance Voting Common Stock, has voted in\nfavor of the Mergers, it is not entitled to\nexercise appraisal rights in respect of the\nMergers.\n                                              \n  Material U.S. Federal Income Tax            \n  Considerations                              \n                                              \nThe Mergers. For U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, the Mergers, taken together, are\nintended to constitute a single integrated\ntransaction that qualifies as a\n\u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to the\nobligations of Morgan Stanley and Eaton Vance\nto complete the Mergers that each of Morgan\nStanley and Eaton Vance receive an opinion\nfrom Davis Polk and WilmerHale, respectively\n(or, in each case, another third party\nnationally recognized law or accounting firm\nreasonably agreed to by the parties), dated\nthe closing date of the Mergers, to the effect\nthat the Mergers, taken together as an\nintegrated transaction, will qualify as a\n\u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code. These opinions of counsel\nwill be based on assumptions, representations,\nwarranties and covenants of Eaton Vance,\nMorgan Stanley, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2.\nIf any of the assumptions, representations,\ncovenants or undertakings is incorrect,\nincomplete, inaccurate, or is violated, the\nvalidity of the opinions may be affected and\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Mergers could differ materially from those\ndescribed in this information\nstatement/prospectus. Neither Morgan Stanley\nnor Eaton Vance will request a ruling from the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) with\nrespect to the tax treatment of the Mergers.\n\nThe United States federal income tax\nconsequences to a particular holder of Eaton\nVance Common Stock of the Mergers will depend\non whether such holder of Eaton Vance Common\nStock receives solely Morgan Stanley\n                      82                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nCommon Stock, a combination of cash and Morgan\nStanley Common Stock, or solely cash in\nexchange for such holder's shares of Eaton\nVance Common Stock. Assuming that the Mergers\nqualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (i)\u00a0a\nholder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nreceives solely shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock in the Mergers generally will not\nrecognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes as a result of such exchange,\nexcept with respect to the receipt of cash in\nlieu of a fractional share of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock and (ii)\u00a0a holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock who receives a combination of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock and cash in the\nMergers generally will recognize gain (equal\nto the excess, if any, of the value of the\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock plus the amount of\ncash received over the holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the Eaton Vance Common Stock\nexchanged therefor), but not loss, to the\nextent such gain does not exceed the amount of\ncash the holder receives in such exchange. A\nholder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nreceives solely cash in the Mergers will\nrecognize gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference between the amount of cash\nreceived and the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\nin the shares exchanged therefor.\n\nThe Special Dividend. For U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, the Special Dividend is intended\nto be treated, and will be reported by Eaton\nVance to shareholders of record on December 4,\n2020, as a distribution by Eaton Vance within\nthe meaning of Section 301 of the Code. Under\nSection 301 of the Code, the Special Dividend\nwill be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes to the extent paid out of\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits of\nEaton Vance. Any amount of the Special\nDividend treated as a dividend for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes paid to a non-U.S.\nholder (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u201d beginning on page\n112 of this information statement/prospectus)\nwill generally be subject to withholding tax\nat a 30% rate (or such lower rate specified by\nan applicable income tax treaty).\n\nYou should read \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income\nTax Considerations\u201d beginning on page\n                                              \n  112                                         \n                                              \nof this information statement/prospectus for a\nmore complete discussion of the U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations relating to the\nMergers and Special Dividend.

As a result, the\nrecorded assets and liabilities of Morgan\nStanley will be carried forward at their\ncarrying values and the historical operating\nresults for Morgan Stanley will be unchanged\nfor prior periods. The assets and liabilities\nof Eaton Vance will be adjusted to their\nrespective fair values at the closing date of\nthe Mergers, including any identifiable\nintangible assets acquired. In addition, any\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired will be\nrecorded as goodwill. The purchase price will\nbe comprised of the closing date fair value of\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Common Stock to be issued to\nEaton Vance stockholders and cash\nconsideration payable in connection with the\nMergers. In accordance with current accounting\nguidance, goodwill and any indefinite-lived\nintangible assets will not be amortized but\nwill be evaluated for impairment annually and\nunder certain circumstances. Identified\nfinite-lived intangible assets will be\namortized over their estimated lives and\ntested for impairment when indicators of\nimpairment exist. Further, the acquisition\nmethod of accounting will result in the\noperating results of Eaton Vance being\nincluded in the operating results of Morgan\nStanley beginning from the date of completion\nof the Mergers.\nListing of Shares of Morgan Stanley Common    \nStock and Delisting and Deregistration of     \nShares of Eaton Vance Stock                   \nApplication will be made to have the shares of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock to be issued in\nthe Mergers approved for listing on the NYSE,\nwhere shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nare currently traded.

There can be no\nassurances as to when, or if, the Mergers will\noccur. If the Mergers are not completed on or\nbefore the End Date, either Morgan Stanley or\nEaton Vance may terminate the Merger\nAgreement. The right to terminate the Merger\nAgreement after the End Date will not be\navailable to Morgan Stanley or Eaton Vance, as\napplicable, if that party\u2019s breach of any\nprovision of the Merger Agreement resulted in\nthe failure of the Mergers to be completed by\nthe End Date.

Accordingly,\nthe total number of shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock to be issued and the total amount\nof cash to be paid by Morgan Stanley as part\nof the Merger Consideration will not change\nfrom what was agreed to in the Merger\nAgreement (other than for adjustment as\ndescribed below under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Adjustments\u201d). However, since the\nmarket price of Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nwill fluctuate, the total value of the Mixed\nConsideration and the value of the Stock\nConsideration may increase or decrease between\nthe date of the Merger Agreement and the\nEffective Time. Accordingly, the value of the\nactual per share consideration to be paid to\nEaton Vance stockholders cannot be determined\nuntil after the determination of the Morgan\nStanley Common Stock Reference Price. No\nfractional shares of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock will be issued in the Mergers, and Eaton\nVance stockholders will receive cash in lieu\nof any fractional shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock, as described below under \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Fractional Shares\u201d.\n                      85                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nMixed Consideration The Merger Agreement      \nprovides that each share of Eaton Vance Common\nStock with respect to which an Eaton Vance    \nstockholder makes an election to receive a    \nfixed combination of cash and Morgan Stanley  \nCommon Stock (each, a \u201cMixed Consideration    \nElecting Share\u201d), and each share for which an \nEaton Vance stockholder fails to make any     \nelection with respect to such stockholder\u2019s   \nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock prior to   \nthe Election Deadline (each, a \u201cNon-Electing  \nShare\u201d), will be converted into the right to  \nreceive the Mixed Consideration.

The\nForm of Election will allow each Eaton Vance\nstockholder to specify the number of shares of\nEaton Vance Common Stock with respect to which\nsuch holder elects to receive Cash\nConsideration, Stock Consideration or Mixed\nConsideration. The election must be made prior\nto the Election Deadline. The Election\nDeadline will be 5:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on the date that is three business days\nbefore the closing date.

If a cash\nelection or stock election is so revoked, the\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock represented\nby the Form of Election will be treated as\nshares electing Mixed Consideration unless the\nstockholder properly makes a subsequent\nelection. The accounts of holders of\nUncertificated Shares will not be credited at\nthe Depository Trust Company, unless that\nstockholder so requests.

This\ndiscussion is based upon the Code, Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder,\nadministrative rulings and judicial decisions\nin effect as of the date of this information\nstatement/prospectus, all of which are subject\nto change at any time, possibly with\nretroactive effect. Any such change could\naffect the accuracy of the statements and\nconclusions set forth in this discussion. This\ndiscussion does not address any U.S. state or\nlocal or non-U.S. tax considerations or any\nU.S. federal estate, gift, alternative minimum\ntax, or Medicare contribution tax\nconsiderations.\n\nThe following discussion applies only to\nholders of Eaton Vance Common Stock who hold\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock as capital\nassets within the meaning of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment).\nFurther, this discussion does not purport to\nconsider all aspects of U.S. federal income\ntaxation that might be relevant to such\nholders in light of their particular\ncircumstances and does not apply to holders\nsubject to special treatment under the U.S.\nfederal income tax laws (such as, for example,\ndealers or brokers in securities, commodities\nor foreign currencies; traders in securities\nthat elect to apply a mark-to-market method of\naccounting; persons who are required to\nrecognize income or gain with respect to the\nMergers no later than such income or gain is\nrequired to be reported on an applicable\nfinancial statement under Section 451(b) of\nthe Code; banks and certain other financial\ninstitutions; insurance companies; mutual\nfunds; tax-exempt organizations; partnerships,\nS corporations or other pass-through entities\nor investors therein; regulated investment\ncompanies; real estate investment trusts;\ncontrolled foreign corporations; passive\nforeign investment companies; former citizens\nor residents of the United States; holders\nwhose functional currency is not the U.S.\ndollar; holders who hold shares of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock as part of a hedge, straddle,\nconstructive sale or conversion transaction or\nother integrated investment; holders who\nacquired Eaton Vance Common Stock pursuant to\nthe exercise of employee stock options,\nthrough a tax qualified retirement plan or\notherwise as compensation; or holders who own\nor have owned (directly, indirectly or\nconstructively) 5% or more of Eaton Vance\u2019s\nstock (by vote or value)).\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S.\nholder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock that is, for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, (i)\u00a0an individual citizen or\nresident of the United States, (ii)\u00a0a\ncorporation, or entity treated as a\ncorporation, organized in or under the laws of\nthe United States or any political subdivision\nthereof, (iii)\u00a0an estate, the income of which\nis includible in gross income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, regardless of its source,\nor (iv)\u00a0a trust if (a) a court within the\nUnited States is able to exercise primary\nsupervision over the trust\u2019s administration\nand one or more U.S. persons has the authority\nto control all of the trust\u2019s substantial\ndecisions or (b)\u00a0such trust has made a valid\nelection to be treated as a U.S. person for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. A \u201cnon-U.S.\nholder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock that is not a U.S. holder.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes holds Eaton Vance Common Stock, the\ntax treatment of a partner in such partnership\nwill generally depend on the status of the\npartner and the activities of the partnership.\nAny entity treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes that holds Eaton\nVance Common Stock, and any partners in such\npartnership, should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the tax consequences of the Mergers\nand Special Dividend to their specific\ncircumstances.\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, the\nMergers, taken together, are intended to\nconstitute a single integrated transaction\nthat qualifies as a \u201creorganization\u201d within\nthe meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It\nis a condition to the obligations of Morgan\nStanley and Eaton Vance to complete the\nMergers that each of Morgan Stanley and Eaton\nVance receive an opinion from Davis Polk and\nWilmerHale, respectively (or, in each case,\nanother third party nationally recognized law\nor accounting firm reasonably agreed to by the\nparties), dated the closing date of the\nMergers, to the effect that the Mergers, taken\ntogether as an integrated transaction, will\nqualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These\nopinions of counsel will be based on\nassumptions, representations, warranties and\ncovenants of Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley,\nMerger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2. If any of the\nassumptions, representations, covenants or\nundertakings is incorrect, incomplete,\ninaccurate, or is violated, the validity of\nthe opinions may be affected and the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the Mergers\ncould differ materially from those described\nin this information statement/prospectus.\n\nAn opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s\nlegal judgment but is not binding on the IRS\nor any court and there can be no assurance\nthat the IRS will not challenge the\nconclusions reflected in the opinions or that\na court would not sustain such a challenge.\nNeither Morgan Stanley nor Eaton Vance will\nrequest a ruling from the IRS with respect to\nthe tax treatment of the Mergers or Special\nDividend, and as a result, no assurance can be\ngiven that the IRS will\n                     112                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nnot challenge the treatment of the Mergers or\nthe Special Dividend described below or that a\ncourt would not sustain such a challenge. If\nthe IRS were to successfully challenge the\n\u201creorganization\u201d status of the Mergers, the\ntax consequences would differ from those set\nforth in this information statement/prospectus\nand holders of Eaton Vance Common Stock could\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the\nreceipt of Morgan Stanley Common Stock, cash,\nor a combination thereof in the Mergers.\n\nThe following discussion assumes that the\nMergers, taken together, will constitute a\nsingle integrated transaction that qualifies\nas a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 368(a) of the Code.\n                                              \n  U.S. Holders                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  Tax Consequences of the Mergers Generally   \n                                              \nNeither Morgan Stanley nor Eaton Vance will\nrecognize gain or loss for United States\nfederal income tax purposes as a result of the\nMergers.\n\nThe United States federal income tax\nconsequences of the Mergers to a particular\nU.S. holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock will\ndepend on whether such holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock receives cash, shares of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock or a combination of cash\nand shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock in\nexchange for such holder's shares of Eaton\nVance Common Stock. The terms of the Merger\nAgreement permit a holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock to make an election with respect\nto each share of Eaton Vance Common Stock to\nreceive cash, Morgan Stanley Common Stock or a\ncombination of cash and Morgan Stanley Common\nStock, subject to automatic adjustment as\ndescribed under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Allocation of Merger Consideration\nand Illustrative Elections and Calculations\u201d\non page 87 of this information\nstatement/prospectus. A U.S. holder may make a\ndifferent election with respect to particular\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock. The U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to a holder\nwill not be ascertainable until the amount of\ncash and shares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nthe holder will receive in the Mergers, as a\nresult of the holder\u2019s elections, is\ndetermined.\n\nA holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nacquired different blocks of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock at different times and at\ndifferent prices generally must apply the\nrules described in the following sections\nseparately to each identifiable block of\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock. A U.S.\nholder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who holds\nEaton Vance Common Stock with differing bases\nor holding periods should consult the holder\u2019s\ntax advisor with regard to the tax\nconsequences of making the elections described\nabove in this information statement/prospectus\nto receive the Mixed Consideration, Cash\nConsideration or Stock Consideration, subject\nto automatic adjustment, for particular shares\nof Eaton Vance Common Stock, identifying the\nparticular shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nfor which various elections are made and\nidentifying the bases or holding periods of\nthe particular shares of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock received in the Mergers.\nExchange of Shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nSolely for Shares of Morgan Stanley Common    \nStock                                         \nExcept as described below with respect to the\nreceipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share\nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock, a U.S. holder\nwho receives solely shares of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock in exchange for shares of Eaton\nVance Common Stock in the Mergers will\ngenerally not recognize gain or loss as a\nresult of such exchange. A U.S. holder\u2019s\naggregate tax basis in the Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock received in exchange for the\nEaton Vance Common Stock surrendered\n(including the basis allocable to any\nfractional share of Morgan Stanley Common\nStock for which cash is received) will equal\nthe U.S. holder\u2019s aggregate tax basis in the\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock exchanged\ntherefor (after taking into account the\nSpecial Dividend, as described below). A U.S.\nholder\u2019s holding period in the Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock received (including the holding\nperiod of any fractional share of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock deemed received and\nredeemed, as described below) will include the\nholding period for the holder\u2019s shares of\nEaton Vance Common Stock surrendered in\nexchange therefor.\nExchange of Shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nSolely for Cash                               \nA U.S. holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock who\nreceives solely cash in exchange for shares of\nEaton Vance Common Stock in the Mergers\ngenerally will recognize capital gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the amount of\ncash received by such holder and such holder's\ntax basis in the shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock exchanged therefor (after taking into\naccount the Special Dividend, as described\nbelow). The IRS has interpreted Section 356 of\nthe Code in a manner that would not entitle a\nU.S. holder that exchanges an identifiable\nblock of Eaton Vance Common Stock solely for\ncash, but also exchanges a different\nidentifiable block of Eaton Vance Common\n                     113                      \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nStock solely for Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nor Morgan Stanley Common Stock and cash, to\ntake any loss with respect to the block of\nEaton Vance Common Stock exchanged solely for\ncash, although the IRS and Treasury Department\nstated in the preamble to regulations\naddressing basis allocation issues, published\nin 2006, that they were considering whether\nregulations should be adopted interpreting\nSection 356 of the Code in a manner that would\npermit a taxpayer to recognize a loss in\nsimilar fact patterns. If such a U.S. holder\nrealizes a loss with respect to shares of\nEaton Vance Common Stock exchanged for cash,\nsuch holder should consult the holder\u2019s tax\nadvisor with respect to the possibility of\nrecognizing such loss and if such loss is not\nrecognized, the allocation of any excess basis\nin such shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nsurrendered to Morgan Stanley Common Stock\nreceived in the Mergers.\nExchange of Shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nfor a Combination of Morgan Stanley Common    \nStock and Cash                                \nExcept as described below with respect to the\nreceipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share\nof Morgan Stanley Common Stock, a U.S. holder\nof Eaton Vance Common Stock who exchanges\nshares of Eaton Vance Common Stock for a\ncombination of Morgan Stanley Common Stock and\ncash will recognize gain, if any, (but not\nloss) equal to the lesser of (i)\u00a0the excess,\nif any, of the amount of cash plus the fair\nmarket value at the Effective Time of the\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock received in\nexchange for such shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock in the Mergers, over such holder's tax\nbasis in the shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock exchanged therefor and (ii)\u00a0the amount\nof cash received by such holder in exchange\nfor such shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock.\nGenerally, such holder's aggregate tax basis\nin the Morgan Stanley Common Stock received by\nsuch holder in the Mergers, including the\nbasis allocable to any fractional share of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock for which cash is\nreceived, will equal such holder's aggregate\ntax basis in the shares of Eaton Vance Common\nStock exchanged therefor (after taking into\naccount the Special Dividend, as described\nbelow), increased by the amount of taxable\ngain, if any, recognized by such holder of\nEaton Vance Common Stock in the exchange of\nsuch shares, and decreased by the amount of\ncash received by such holder of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock in exchange for such shares of\nEaton Vance Common Stock. A U.S. holder\u2019s\nholding period in the Morgan Stanley Common\nStock received (including the holding period\nof any fractional share of Morgan Stanley\nCommon Stock deemed received and redeemed, as\ndescribed below) will include the holding\nperiod for the holder\u2019s shares of Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock surrendered in exchange therefor.\n                                              \n  Cash in Lieu of Fractional Share            \n                                              \nA U.S. holder of Eaton Vance Common Stock that\nreceives cash in lieu of a fractional share of\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock will generally be\ntreated as having received such fractional\nshare and then as having received such cash in\nredemption of the fractional share. Gain or\nloss will generally be recognized based on the\ndifference between the amount of cash received\nin lieu of the fractional share of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock and the portion of the\nU.S. holder\u2019s aggregate adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares of Eaton Vance Common Stock\nexchanged therefor which is allocable to the\nfractional share.\n                                              \n  Capital Gain or Loss                        \n                                              \nAny gain or loss recognized with respect to\nthe exchange of Eaton Vance Common Stock in\nthe Mergers will generally be capital gain or\nloss. Such gain or loss will generally be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.\nholder\u2019s holding period for its Eaton Vance\nCommon Stock surrendered in the Mergers\nexceeds one year at the Effective Time. Long-\nterm capital gains of certain non-corporate\nholders of Eaton Vance Common Stock, including\nindividuals, are generally taxed at\npreferential rates. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to limitations.\n                                              \n  Recharacterization as a Dividend            \n                                              \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, it is possible\nthat a U.S. holder may be required to treat\nany gain recognized or cash received as a\ndividend to the extent of such U.S. holder's\nratable share of the undistributed earnings\nand profits of Eaton Vance if such holder\u2019s\npercentage ownership in Morgan Stanley\n(including Morgan Stanley stock that the\nholder is deemed to own under certain\nattribution rules) after the Mergers is not\nmeaningfully reduced from what the holder\u2019s\npercentage ownership would have been if the\nholder had received solely shares of Morgan\nStanley Common Stock rather than cash and\nMorgan Stanley Common Stock, if any, in the\nMergers, which is referred to as a dividend\nequivalent transaction. A U.S. holder with a\nrelatively minimal stock interest in Eaton\nVance and Morgan Stanley that experiences a\nreduction in its proportionate interest in\nMorgan Stanley as a result of the Mergers\ngenerally should not be regarded as having had\na dividend equivalent transaction as a result\nof the Mergers. Since the possibility of\ndividend treatment depends primarily upon the\nparticular circumstances of a holder of Eaton\nVance Common Stock,\n                     114                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nincluding the application of certain          \nconstructive ownership rules, holders of Eaton\nVance Common Stock (particularly holders that \nalso own actually or constructively Morgan    \nStanley stock before the Mergers) should      \nconsult their tax advisors as to the          \npossibility that all or a portion of any cash \nreceived in the exchange for their shares of  \nEaton Vance Common Stock will be treated as a \ndividend. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nof the Special Dividend Under the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,\nEaton Vance shall declare and pay the Special \nDividend. On November 23, 2020, the Board of  \nDirectors of Eaton Vance declared the Special \nDividend, which is payable on December 18,    \n2020, to shareholders of record on December 4,\n2020. Because the Special Dividend is payable \non December 18, 2020 to shareholders of record\non December 4, 2020 regardless of whether or  \nnot the Mergers are completed and whether such\nholder holds Eaton Vance Common Stock at the  \nEffective Time, the Special Dividend is       \nintended to be treated, and will be reported  \nby Eaton Vance to shareholders of record on   \nDecember 4, 2020, as a distribution by Eaton  \nVance within the meaning of Section 301 of the\nCode. Under Section 301 of the Code, the      \nSpecial Dividend will be treated as a dividend\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes to the   \nextent paid out of current or accumulated     \nearnings and profits of Eaton Vance.          \nGenerally, individual U.S. holders who meet   \napplicable holding period requirements under  \nthe Code for \u201cqualified dividends\u201d (generally \nmore than 60 days during the 121-day period   \nsurrounding the ex-dividend date) will be     \ntaxed on the Special Dividend at preferential \nlong-term capital gain rates. To the extent   \nthat the amount of any dividend exceeds Eaton \nVance\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and  \nprofits, the excess will first be treated as a\ntax-free return of capital, causing a         \nreduction in the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted basis \nin the Eaton Vance Common Stock. If such basis\nis reduced to zero, any remaining portion of  \nthe Special Dividend will be taxed as capital \ngain, which would be long-term capital gain if\nthe U.S. holder has held the Eaton Vance      \nCommon Stock for more than one year at the    \ntime the Special Dividend is received. To the \nextent an individual U.S. holder of Eaton     \nVance Common Stock includes the Special       \nDividend in income as a qualified dividend and\nsuch dividend constitutes an \u201cextraordinary   \ndividend\u201d (generally, where the amount of the \ndividend exceeds 10% of the holder\u2019s tax basis\nin its stock), any loss on the sale or        \nexchange of such stock, to the extent of such \ndividend, will be treated as long-term capital\nloss. The deductibility of capital losses is  \nsubject to limitations. U.S. holders of Eaton \nVance Common Stock should consult their tax   \nadvisors regarding the possible applicability \nof the extraordinary dividend provisions of   \nthe Code with respect to the Special Dividend \nand the potential effect of such provisions on\nany losses realized with respect to           \nconsideration received in the Mergers.

The Morgan\nStanley Bylaws provide that a special meeting\nof stockholders may be called by Morgan\nStanley\u2019s corporate secretary at the\n                     128                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \ndirection of the Morgan Stanley board of      \ndirectors or at the written request of holders\nof shares of Morgan Stanley stock owning at   \nleast twenty-five percent (25%) of the number \nof outstanding shares of Morgan Stanley stock \nentitled to vote on the matter or matters to  \nbe brought at such meeting as of the most     \nrecent date for which such number is disclosed\nby Morgan Stanley in an annual or quarterly   \nreport filed with the SEC under the Exchange  \nAct before the proposed special meeting.      \nSpecial meetings of Morgan Stanley            \nstockholders may not otherwise be called by   \nMorgan Stanley stockholders. No Stockholder   \nAction by Written Consent The Morgan Stanley  \ncertificate of incorporation provides that,   \nsubject to rights of holders of any series of \nMorgan Stanley preferred stock, stockholder   \naction may be taken at a duly called annual or\nspecial meeting of stockholders but not by    \nwritten consent in lieu of a meeting.         \nProvisions Relating to Amendments to the      \nMorgan Stanley Certificate of Incorporation   \nand the Morgan Stanley Bylaws The Morgan      \nStanley Certificate of Incorporation provides \nthat it can only be amended, altered, changed \nor repealed in the manner prescribed in the   \nMorgan Stanley Certificate of Incorporation   \nand by applicable law. Under Delaware law, an \namendment to a corporation\u2019s certificate of   \nincorporation generally requires a board      \nresolution declaring the advisability of the  \namendment and approval by the holders of a    \nmajority of the outstanding stock entitled to \nvote thereon, unless the corporation\u2019s        \ncertificate of incorporation requires a       \ngreater vote. If the proposed amendment would \nincrease or decrease the aggregate number of  \nauthorized shares of a class of stock,        \nincrease or decrease the par value of the     \nshares of such class or change the powers,    \npreferences or special rights of the shares of\nsuch class so as to affect them adversely, the\nholders of a majority of the outstanding      \nshares of such class will be entitled to vote \nas a class upon the proposed amendment. The   \nMorgan Stanley certificate of incorporation   \nfurther provides that any amendment or repeal \nof certain articles thereof that relate to    \ndirectors\u2019 liability for breach of fiduciary  \nduty and indemnification to directors,        \nofficers, employees and agents will not       \nadversely affect any right or protection      \nexisting thereunder in respect of any act or  \nomission occurring prior to such amendment or \nrepeal. Under Delaware law, the power to      \nadopt, amend or repeal bylaws is vested in    \nstockholders, unless a corporation\u2019s          \ncertificate of incorporation confers the power\nto adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon         \ndirectors as well. The Morgan Stanley         \nCertificate of Incorporation provides that    \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s board of directors is        \nauthorized and empowered to adopt, amend or   \nrepeal the Morgan Stanley bylaws, and that    \nsuch bylaws may be amended or repealed by     \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s stockholders having voting   \npower with respect thereto. Further, the      \nMorgan Stanley Bylaws provide that they may be\naltered, amended or repealed, in whole or in  \npart, or new bylaws may be adopted by Morgan  \nStanley\u2019s stockholders or the Morgan Stanley  \nboard of directors at any meeting thereof,    \nprovided that notice of such amendment is     \ncontained in the notice of such meeting of    \nstockholders or in the notice of such meeting \nof the board of directors, and, in the latter \ncase, such notice is given not less than      \ntwenty-four hours prior to the meeting.       \nDelaware\u2019s Anti-Takeover Statute Under        \nDelaware law, a corporation is prohibited from\nengaging in any business combination with an  \ninterested stockholder for a period of three  \nyears from the date on which any such         \nstockholder first becomes an interested       \nstockholder unless:                           \n                                              \n     prior to the stockholder becoming an     \n     interested stockholder, the board of     \n  \u2022  directors approves the business          \n     combination or the transaction in which  \n     the stockholder became an interested     \n     stockholder;                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     upon the consummation of the             \n     transaction in which the stockholder     \n     became an interested stockholder, the    \n  \u2022  interested stockholder owns at least     \n     85% of the voting stock of the           \n     corporation other than shares held by    \n     directors who are also officers and      \n     certain employee stock plans; or         \n                                              \n                                              \n     the business combination is approved by  \n     the board of directors and by the        \n  \u2022  affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the       \n     outstanding voting stock not owned by    \n     the interested stockholder at a          \n     meeting.                                 \n                                              \nDelaware law defines the term \u201cbusiness       \ncombination\u201d to include, among other things,  \ntransactions such as mergers or consolidations\nwith an interested stockholder or certain     \nsales, transfers, exchanges or other          \ndispositions of assets to an interested       \nstockholder, which assets have an aggregate   \nmarket value equal to 10% or more of either   \nthe aggregate market                          \n                                              \n129                                           \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \nvalue of all the assets of the corporation or\naggregate market value of all the outstanding\nstock of the corporation. Delaware law defines\nthe term \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to include\nany person who (together with affiliates and\nassociates) owns (or in certain cases, within\nthe past three years did own) 15% or more of\nthe outstanding voting stock of the\ncorporation. A corporation can expressly elect\nnot to be governed by the business combination\nprovisions in Delaware law in its certificate\nof incorporation or bylaws, but Morgan Stanley\nhas not done so.\n                                              \n  Regulatory Restrictions on Ownership        \n                                              \nThe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHC\nAct\u201d) requires any bank holding company (as\ndefined in the BHC Act) to obtain the approval\nof the Federal Reserve Board prior to\nacquiring more than five percent (5%)\u00a0of\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s outstanding common stock. Any\nperson, other than a bank holding company, is\nrequired to obtain prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve Board to acquire ten percent\n(10%) or more of Morgan Stanley\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock under the CIBC Act. Anyone (other\nthan an individual) who either owns, controls\nor has the power to vote twenty-five percent\n(25%) or more of any class of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nvoting securities, controls in any manner the\nelection of a majority of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\ndirectors, or directly or indirectly exercises\na controlling influence over the management or\npolicies of Morgan Stanley, is subject to\nregulation as a bank holding company under the\nBHC\u00a0Act.\n                     130                      \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nCOMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS If the       \ntransactions contemplated by the Merger       \nAgreement are completed, Eaton Vance          \nstockholders will receive shares of Morgan    \nStanley Common Stock in connection with the   \nMergers and become stockholders of Morgan     \nStanley. The following is a summary of certain\ndifferences between (i) the current rights of \nEaton Vance stockholders under Maryland law,  \nthe Eaton Vance amended and restated articles \nof incorporation, as amended by the articles  \nof amendment thereto (referred to in this     \nsection as the \u201cEaton Vance charter\u201d) and the \nEaton Vance Bylaws, and (ii) the current      \nrights of Morgan Stanley stockholders under   \nDelaware law, the Morgan Stanley Certificate  \nof Incorporation, including the certificates  \nof designation relating to each series of     \nMorgan Stanley preferred stock (referred to in\nthis section as the \u201cMorgan Stanley charter\u201d) \nand the Morgan Stanley bylaws. The following  \nsummary is not a complete statement of the    \nrights of stockholders of the two companies or\na complete description of the specific        \nprovisions referred to below. This summary is \nqualified in its entirety by reference to the \nDelaware General Corporation law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d),\nthe MGCL and Morgan Stanley\u2019s and Eaton       \nVance\u2019s governing documents (which we urge you\nto read carefully and in their entirety).     \nCopies of the respective companies\u2019 governing \ndocuments have been filed with the SEC. To    \nfind out where copies of these documents can  \nbe obtained, see \u201cWhere You Can Find More     \nInformation\u201d beginning on page 153of this     \ninformation statement/prospectus. In addition,\nthe identification of some of the differences \nin the rights of Morgan Stanley and Eaton     \nVance stockholders is not intended to indicate\nthat other differences that are equally       \nimportant do not exist. Morgan Stanley and    \nEaton Vance urge you to carefully read this   \nentire information statement/prospectus, the  \nrelevant provisions of the DGCL, the MGCL and \nthe other documents to which Morgan Stanley   \nand Eaton Vance refer in this information     \nstatement/prospectus for a more complete      \nunderstanding of the differences between the  \nrights of a Morgan Stanley stockholder and the\nrights of an Eaton Vance stockholder. Between \nthe date of the Merger Agreement and the      \nEffective Time, Eaton Vance has agreed not to \namend its governing documents and Morgan      \nStanley has agreed not to amend its governing \ndocuments in a manner that would be materially\nadverse to Eaton Vance stockholders. Morgan   \nStanley is incorporated under the laws of the \nState of Delaware and the rights of Morgan    \nStanley stockholders are governed by the DGCL \nand other applicable Delaware law. Eaton Vance\nis incorporated under the laws of the State of\nMaryland and the rights of Eaton Vance are    \ngoverned by the MGCL and other applicable     \nMaryland law. As a result of the Mergers,     \nEaton Vance stockholders will receive cash and\nshares of Morgan Stanley stock and will become\nMorgan Stanley stockholders. Thus, following  \nthe Mergers, the rights of Eaton Vance        \nstockholders who become Morgan Stanley        \nstockholders in connection with the Mergers   \nwill be governed by the DGCL and the other    \napplicable Delaware law and will also then be \ngoverned by the Morgan Stanley charter and the\nMorgan Stanley bylaws.

At your direction, we have assumed\nfor purposes of this Opinion that the Company\nVoting Common Stock and the Company Non-Voting\nCommon Stock have equivalent economic value,\nnotwithstanding the different voting rights\nand other non-financial terms of such shares\nthat could impact their respective values, and\nhave disregarded the individual circumstances\nof specific security holders with respect to\ncontrol, voting or other rights, aspects or\nrelationships which may distinguish such\nholders.

Section 102(b)(7) of the        \nDelaware General Corporation law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) \npermits a corporation to provide in its       \ncertificate of incorporation that a director  \nof the corporation shall not be personally    \nliable to the corporation or its stockholders \nfor monetary damages for breach of fiduciary  \nduty as a director, except for liability (i)  \nfor any breach of the director\u2019s duty of      \nloyalty to the corporation or its             \nstockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not  \nin good faith or which involve intentional    \nmisconduct or a knowing violation of law,     \n(iii) for unlawful payments of dividends or   \nunlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or    \nother distributions, (iv) for any transaction \nfrom which the director derived an improper   \npersonal benefit or (v) any act or omission   \nbefore the adoption of such a provision in the\ncertificate of incorporation. The Morgan      \nStanley certificate of incorporation limits   \nthe personal liability of a director to Morgan\nStanley and its stockholders for monetary     \ndamages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a   \ndirector to the fullest extent permitted by   \nlaw.

Section 145 of the DGCL\ncontains provisions for mandatory and         \ndiscretionary indemnification of a            \ncorporation\u2019s directors, officers and other   \npersonnel, and related matters. Under Section \n145 of the DGCL, a corporation may indemnify  \ndirectors and officers as well as other       \nemployees and individuals against expenses    \n(including attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines \nand amounts paid in settlement actually and   \nreasonably incurred by such person in         \nconnection with any threatened, pending or    \ncompleted actions, suits or proceedings in    \nwhich such person is made a party by reason of\nsuch person being or having been a director,  \nofficer, employee or agent of the corporation.\nThe DGCL provides that Section 145 is not     \nexclusive of other rights to which those      \nseeking indemnification may be entitled under \nany bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or \ndisinterested directors or otherwise. Expenses\nincurred by any such person in defending any  \nsuch proceeding in advance of its final       \ndisposition upon receipt (unless Morgan       \nStanley upon authorization of the board of    \ndirectors of Morgan Stanley waives such       \nrequirement to the extent permitted by        \napplicable law) of an undertaking by or on    \nbehalf of such person to repay such amount if \nit shall ultimately be determined that such   \nperson is not entitled to be indemnified by   \nMorgan Stanley as authorized in the Morgan    \nStanley bylaws or otherwise. Insurance . The  \nMorgan Stanley bylaws provide that Morgan     \nStanley may maintain insurance, at its        \nexpense, for the benefit of Morgan Stanley and\nany person who is or was a director, officer, \npartner, member, employee or agent of Morgan  \nStanley or Morgan Stanley\u2019s subsidiary or of  \nanother corporation, partnership, limited     \nliability company, joint venture, trust or    \nother enterprise against any expense,         \nliability or loss, whether or not Morgan      \nStanley would have the power to indemnify such\nperson against such expense, liability or loss\nunder the DGCL.
