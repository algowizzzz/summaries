We compete in the\nU.S. and globally for\nclients, market share\nand human talent.\nOperating\n\nwithin the financial\nservices industry on a\nglobal basis presents,\namong other things,\ntechnological, risk\nmanagement,\nregulatory,\ninfrastructure and\nother challenges that\nrequire effective\nresource allocation in\norder for us to remain\ncompetitive. Our\ncompetitive position\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including our\nreputation, client\nexperience, the\nquality and\nconsistency of our\nlong-term investment\nperformance,\ninnovation, execution,\nrelative pricing and\nother factors,\nincluding entering\ninto new or expanding\ncurrent businesses as\na result of\nacquisitions and other\nstrategic initiatives.\nOur ability to sustain\nor improve our\ncompetitive position\nalso depends\nsubstantially on our\nability to continue to\nattract and retain\nhighly qualified\nemployees while\nmanaging compensation\nand other costs. We\ncompete with\ncommercial banks,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, brokerage\nfirms, insurance\ncompanies, exchanges,\nelectronic trading and\nclearing platforms,\nfinancial data\nrepositories, sponsors\nof mutual funds, hedge\nfunds, real assets\nfunds and private\ncredit and equity\nfunds, energy\ncompanies, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial or\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally,\nincluding through the\ninternet. In addition,\nrestrictive laws and\nregulations applicable\nto certain global\nfinancial services\ninstitutions, which\nhave been increasing\nin complexity and\nvolume, may prohibit\nus from engaging in\ncertain transactions,\nimpose more stringent\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, increase\ncosts, and can put us\nat a competitive\ndisadvantage to\ncompetitors in certain\nbusinesses not subject\nto these same\nrequirements.

We\noperate as a BHC and\nFHC under the BHC Act\nand are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve. In\nparticular, we are\nsubject to (among\nother things):\nsignificant regulation\nand supervision;\nintensive scrutiny of\nour businesses and\nplans for expansion of\nthose businesses;\nlimitations on\nactivities; a systemic\nrisk regime that\nimposes heightened\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements;\n\nrestrictions on\nactivities and\ninvestments imposed by\na section of the BHC\nAct added by the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) referred\nto as the \u201cVolcker\nRule\u201d; and\ncomprehensive\nderivatives\nregulation.

The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\nbanking entities,\nincluding us and our\naffiliates, from\nengaging in certain\nproprietary trading\nactivities, as defined\nin the Volcker Rule,\nsubject to exemptions\nfor underwriting,\nmarket-making, risk-\nmitigating hedging and\ncertain other\nactivities. The\nVolcker Rule also\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule, subject to a\nnumber of exemptions\nand exclusions.

In\naddition to capital\nregulations, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have\nadopted liquidity and\nfunding standards,\nincluding the LCR, the\nNSFR, liquidity stress\ntesting and associated\nliquidity reserve\nrequirements.\n\nFor more information,\nsee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Balance\nSheet\u2014Regulatory\nLiquidity Framework.\u201d\n\nSystemic Risk Regime.\nUnder rules issued by\nthe Federal Reserve,\nlarge BHCs, including\nMorgan Stanley, must\nconduct internal\nliquidity stress\ntests, maintain\nunencumbered highly\nliquid assets to meet\nprojected net cash\noutflows for 30 days\nover the range of\nliquidity stress\nscenarios used in\ninternal stress tests,\nand comply with\nvarious liquidity risk\nmanagement\nrequirements. These\nlarge BHCs also must\ncomply with a range of\nrisk management and\ncorporate governance\nrequirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nalso imposes single-\ncounterparty credit\nlimits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for\nlarge banking\norganizations. U.S.\nG-SIBs, including us,\nare subject to a limit\nof 15% of Tier 1\ncapital for aggregate\nnet credit exposures\nto any \u201cmajor\ncounterparty\u201d (defined\nto include other U.S.\nG-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs\nand non-bank\nsystemically important\nfinancial institutions\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve). In\naddition, we are\nsubject to a limit of\n25% of Tier 1 capital\nfor aggregate net\ncredit exposures to\nany other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nUnder the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the Federal\nReserve is required to\nadopt rules that would\ncreate a new early\nremediation framework\nto address financial\ndistress or material\nmanagement weaknesses.\nThe Federal Reserve\nproposed such rules in\n2012, but to date has\nnot finalized these\nproposed rules. The\nFederal Reserve also\nhas the ability to\nestablish additional\nprudential standards,\nincluding those\nregarding contingent\ncapital, enhanced\npublic disclosures and\nlimits on short-term\ndebt, including off-\nbalance sheet\nexposures.

We\nare required to submit\nonce every two years\nto the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC a\nresolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy\nfor a rapid and\norderly resolution\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Interim\nupdates are required\nin certain limited\ncircumstances,\nincluding material\nmergers or\nacquisitions or\nfundamental changes to\nour resolution\nstrategy.\n\nOur preferred\nresolution strategy,\nwhich is set out in\nour most recent\nresolution plan, is an\nSPOE strategy, which\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy after the\nParent Company has\nfiled for bankruptcy.\n\nOur next resolution\nplan is due July 1,\n2023. Further, we\nsubmit an annual\nrecovery plan to the\nFederal Reserve that\noutlines the steps\nthat management could\ntake over time to\ngenerate or conserve\nfinancial resources in\ntimes of prolonged\nfinancial stress.\n\nCertain of our\ndomestic and foreign\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution\nand recovery planning\nrequirements in\n                                \n  3    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe jurisdictions in\nwhich they operate.\nFor example, the FDIC\ncurrently requires\ncertain insured\ndepository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries, to\nsubmit a resolution\nplan every three\nyears, that describes\nthe IDI\u2019s strategy for\na rapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure of the IDI.\n\nIn addition, certain\nfinancial companies,\nincluding BHCs such as\nthe Firm and certain\nof its subsidiaries,\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nwith the FDIC being\nappointed as receiver,\nprovided that\ndetermination of\nextraordinary\nfinancial distress and\nsystemic risk is made\nby the U.S. Treasury\nSecretary in\nconsultation with the\nU.S. President.\nRegulators have\nadopted certain\norderly liquidation\nauthority implementing\nregulations and may\nexpand or clarify\nthese regulations in\nthe future. If we were\nsubject to the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nthe FDIC would have\nconsiderable powers,\nincluding: the power\nto remove directors\nand officers\nresponsible for our\nfailure and to appoint\nnew directors and\nofficers; the power to\nassign our assets and\nliabilities to a third\nparty or bridge\nfinancial company\nwithout the need for\ncreditor consent or\nprior court review;\nthe ability to\ndifferentiate among\nour creditors,\nincluding treating\ncertain creditors\nwithin the same class\nbetter than others,\nsubject to a minimum\nrecovery right on the\npart of disfavored\ncreditors to receive\nat least what they\nwould have received in\nbankruptcy\nliquidation; and broad\npowers to administer\nthe claims process to\ndetermine\ndistributions from the\nassets of the\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas been developing an\nSPOE strategy that\ncould be used to\nimplement the orderly\nliquidation authority.\n\nRegulators have also\ntaken and proposed\nvarious actions to\nfacilitate an SPOE\nstrategy under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nor other resolution\nregimes.\n\nFor more information\nabout our resolution\nplan-related\nsubmissions and\nassociated regulatory\nactions, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk,\u201d\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Total\nLoss-Absorbing\nCapacity, Long-Term\nDebt and Clean Holding\nCompany Requirements\u201d\nand \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory R\nequirements\u2014Resolution\nand Recovery\nPlanning.\u201d\n\nCyber and Information\nSecurity Risk\nManagement and\nProtection of Client\nInformation\n\nThe financial services\nindustry faces\nincreased global\nregulatory focus\nregarding cyber and\ninformation security\nrisk management\npractices. Many\naspects of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto cybersecurity legal\nand regulatory\nrequirements enacted\nby U.S. federal and\nstate governments and\nother non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These\nrequirements are\ngenerally aimed at\ncodifying basic\ncybersecurity\nprotections and\nmandating data breach\nnotification\nrequirements.\n\nOur businesses are\nalso subject to\nincreasing privacy and\ndata protection legal\nrequirements\nconcerning the use and\nprotection of certain\npersonal information\nwith regard to\nclients, employees and\nothers. These\nrequirements impose\nmandatory privacy and\ndata protection\nobligations, including\nproviding for\nindividual rights,\nenhanced governance\nand accountability\nrequirements, and\nsignificant fines and\nlitigation risk for\nnoncompliance. In\naddition, several\njurisdictions have\nenacted or proposed\npersonal data\nlocalization\nrequirements and\nrestrictions on cross-\nborder transfer of\npersonal data that may\nrestrict our ability\nto conduct business in\nthose jurisdictions or\ncreate additional\nfinancial and\nregulatory burdens to\ndo so.\n\nNumerous jurisdictions\nhave passed laws,\nrules and regulations\nin these areas and\nmany are considering\nnew or updated ones\nthat could impact our\nbusinesses,\nparticularly as the\napplication,\ninterpretation and\nenforcement of these\nlaws, rules and\nregulations are often\nuncertain and\nevolving. Many aspects\nof our businesses are\nsubject to legal\nrequirements\nconcerning the use and\nprotection of certain\ncustomer information,\nas well as the privacy\nand cybersecurity laws\nreferenced above. We\nhave adopted measures\ndesigned to comply\nwith these and related\napplicable\nrequirements in all\nrelevant\njurisdictions.\n                                              \n  U.S. Bank Subsidiaries                      \n                                              \nThe U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries are FDIC-\ninsured depository\ninstitutions subject\nto supervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the OCC\nand are subject to the\nOCC\u2019s risk governance\nguidelines, which\nestablish heightened\nstandards for a large\nIDI\u2019s risk governance\nframework and the\noversight of that\nframework by the IDI\u2019s\nboard of directors.\nThe U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries are also\nsubject to prompt\ncorrective action\nstandards, which\nrequire the relevant\nfederal banking\nregulator to take\nprompt corrective\naction with respect to\na depository\ninstitution if that\ninstitution does not\nmeet certain capital\nadequacy standards.

These\ninclude the level and\nvolatility of equity,\nfixed income and\ncommodity prices, the\nlevel and term\nstructure of interest\nrates, inflation and\ncurrency values, the\nlevel of other market\nindices, fiscal or\nmonetary policies\nestablished by central\nbanks and financial\nregulators, and\nuncertainty concerning\ngovernment shutdowns,\ndebt ceilings or\nfunding, which may be\ndriven by economic\nconditions, market\nuncertainty or lack of\nconfidence among\ninvestors and clients\ndue to the effects of\nwidespread events such\nas global pandemics,\nnatural disasters,\nclimate-related\nincidents, acts of war\nor aggression,\ngeopolitical\ninstability, changes\nto global trade\npolicies and the\nimplementation of\ntariffs or\nprotectionist trade\npolicies and other\nfactors, or a\ncombination of these\nor other factors. For\nexample, in 2022, the\nglobal economic and\ngeopolitical\nenvironment was\ncharacterized by\npersistent inflation,\nrising interest rates,\nvolatility in global\nfinancial markets\n(leading to, among\nother things, a\ndecline in equity\nprices), supply chain\ncomplications,\nrecessionary fears,\nand geopolitical\nuncertainty regarding\nthe war between Russia\nand Ukraine and its\nimpact on the global\nmarkets, including the\nenergy markets.\n\nThe results of our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, particularly\nresults relating to\nour involvement in\nprimary and secondary\nmarkets for all types\nof financial products,\nare subject to\nsubstantial market\nfluctuations due to a\nvariety of factors\nthat we cannot control\nor predict with great\ncertainty. These\nfluctuations impact\nresults by causing\nvariations in business\nflows and activity and\nin the fair value of\nsecurities and other\nfinancial products.\nFluctuations also\noccur due to the level\nof global market\nactivity, which, among\nother things, can be\nimpacted by market\nuncertainty or lack of\ninvestor and client\nconfidence due to\nunforeseen economic,\ngeopolitical or\n\nmarket conditions that\nin turn affect the\nsize, number and\ntiming of investment\nbanking client\nassignments and\ntransactions and the\nrealization of returns\nfrom our principal\ninvestments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable\nmarket or economic\nconditions may have\nadverse impacts on the\nlevel of individual\ninvestor confidence\nand participation in\nthe global markets\nand/or the level of\nand mix of client\nassets, which would\nnegatively impact the\nresults of our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nSubstantial market\nfluctuations could\nalso cause variations\nin the value of our\ninvestments in our\nfunds, the flow of\ninvestment capital\ninto or from AUM, and\nthe way customers\nallocate capital among\nmoney market, equity,\nfixed income or other\ninvestment\nalternatives, which\ncould negatively\nimpact the results of\nour Investment\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nThe value of our\nfinancial instruments\nmay be materially\naffected by market\nfluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and\ndisruptions in the\nmarkets may make it\ndifficult to value and\nmonetize certain of\nour financial\ninstruments,\nparticularly during\nperiods of market\nuncertainty or\ndisplacement.\nSubsequent valuations\nin future periods, in\nlight of factors then\nprevailing, may result\nin significant changes\nin the value of these\ninstruments and may\nadversely impact\nhistorical or\nprospective fees and\nperformance-based\nincome (also known as\nincentive fees, which\ninclude carried\ninterest) in respect\nof certain businesses.\nIn addition, at the\ntime of any sales and\nsettlements of these\nfinancial instruments,\nthe price we\nultimately realize\nwill depend on the\ndemand and liquidity\nin the market at that\ntime and may be\nmaterially lower than\ntheir current fair\nvalue. Any of these\nfactors could cause a\ndecline in the value\nof our financial\ninstruments, which may\nadversely affect our\nresults of operations\nin future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial\nmarkets are\nsusceptible to severe\nevents evidenced by\nrapid depreciation in\nasset values\naccompanied by a\nreduction in asset\nliquidity. Under these\nextreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be as\neffective at\nmitigating trading\nlosses as they would\nbe under more normal\nmarket conditions.\nMoreover, under these\nconditions, market\nparticipants are\nparticularly exposed\nto trading strategies\nemployed by many\nmarket participants\nsimultaneously and on\na large scale, which\ncould lead to\nincreased individual\ncounterparty risk for\nour businesses.\nAlthough our risk\nmanagement and\nmonitoring processes\nseek to quantify and\nmitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves,\nsevere market events\nhave historically been\ndifficult to predict,\nand we could realize\nsignificant losses if\nextreme market events\nwere to occur.\n\nHolding large and\nconcentrated positions\nmay expose us to\nlosses.\n\nConcentration of risk\nmay reduce revenues or\nresult in losses in\nour market-making,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting\n(including\n                                \n  9    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nblock trading), and\nlending businesses\n(including margin\nlending) in the event\nof unfavorable market\nmovements.

Furthermore,\nthe concentration of\nFirm and personal\ninformation held by a\nhandful of third-\nparties increases the\nrisk that a breach at\na key third-party may\ncause an industry-wide\nevent that could\nsignificantly increase\nthe cost and risk of\nconducting business.\n\nThere can be no\nassurance that our\nbusiness contingency\nand security response\nplans fully mitigate\nall potential risks to\nus.

See\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation\u201d and\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements.\u201d\n\nFurther, because both\nour resolution plan\ncontemplates an SPOE\nstrategy under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code\nand the FDIC has\nproposed an SPOE\nstrategy through which\nit may apply its\norderly liquidation\nauthority powers, we\nbelieve that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy is the\nreasonably likely\noutcome if either our\nresolution plan were\nimplemented or a\nresolution proceeding\nwere commenced under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority.\nAn SPOE strategy\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy, and the\nParent Company has\nentered into a secured\namended and restated\nsupport agreement with\nsuch entities,\npursuant to which it\nwould provide such\ncapital and liquidity\nto such entities.\n\nIn addition, a wholly\nowned, direct\nsubsidiary of the\nParent Company, Morgan\nStanley Holdings LLC\n(\u201cFunding IHC\u201d),\nserves as a resolution\nfunding vehicle. The\nParent Company has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to the\nFunding IHC. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nmaterial assets that\ncan be contributed\nunder the terms of the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement\n(other than shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets),\nto the Funding IHC.\nThe Funding IHC would\nbe obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity, as\napplicable, to certain\nsupported\nsubsidiaries, pursuant\nto the terms of the\nsecured amended and\nrestated support\nagreement.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and of\nthe Funding IHC,\nrespectively, under\nthe amended and\nrestated support\nagreement are in most\ncases secured on a\nsenior basis by the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany (other than\nshares in subsidiaries\nof the Parent Company\nand certain other\nassets), and the\nassets of the Funding\nIHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of\ncertain supported\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding the\n\nFunding IHC, against\nthe assets of the\nParent Company with\nrespect to such\nsecured assets are\neffectively senior to\nunsecured obligations\nof the Parent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE\nstrategy, whether\napplied pursuant to\nour resolution plan or\nin a resolution\nproceeding under the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, is intended\nto result in better\noutcomes for creditors\noverall, there is no\nguarantee that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy, including\nthe provision of\nsupport to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s supported\nsubsidiaries pursuant\nto the secured amended\nand restated support\nagreement, will not\nresult in greater\nlosses for holders of\nour securities\ncompared with a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy for us.\n\nRegulators have taken\nand proposed various\nactions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, the orderly\nliquidation authority\nand other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequires top-tier BHCs\nof U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to\nmaintain adequate\nTLAC, including equity\nand eligible long-term\ndebt, in order to\nensure that such\ninstitutions have\nenough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point\nof failure to be\nrecapitalized through\nthe conversion of debt\nto equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on\neligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is\nused. The combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the TLAC\nrequirement is that\nour losses will be\nimposed on the holders\nof eligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\nthe creditors of our\nsupported subsidiaries\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nE.U. jurisdictions,\nhave implemented, or\nare in the process of\nimplementing, changes\nto resolution regimes\nto provide resolution\nauthorities with the\nability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity organized in\nsuch jurisdiction by\nwriting down certain\nunsecured liabilities\nor converting certain\nunsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers are\nintended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured creditors.\nThis may increase the\noverall level of\ncapital and liquidity\nrequired by us on a\nconsolidated basis and\nmay result in\nlimitations on our\nability to efficiently\ndistribute capital and\nliquidity among our\naffiliated entities,\nincluding in times of\nstress. Non-U.S.\nregulators are also\nconsidering\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\nTLAC that would pass\nlosses up from the\nsubsidiaries to the\nParent Company and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe Parent Company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented\nfrom paying dividends\nor taking other\ncapital actions\nbecause of regulatory\nconstraints or revised\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve,\nincluding with respect\nto regulatory capital\nrequirements, stress\ntesting and capital\nplanning. We submit,\non at least an annual\nbasis, a capital plan\nto the Federal Reserve\ndescribing proposed\n                                 \n  15    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ndividend payments to\nshareholders, proposed\nrepurchases of our\noutstanding securities\nand other proposed\ncapital actions that\nwe intend to take. Our\nability to take\ncapital actions\ndescribed in the\ncapital plan is\ndependent on, among\nother factors, the\nresults of supervisory\nstress tests conducted\nby the Federal Reserve\nand our compliance\nwith regulatory\ncapital requirements\nimposed by the Federal\nReserve.\n\nIn addition, the\nFederal Reserve may\nchange regulatory\ncapital requirements\nto impose higher\nrequirements that\nrestrict our ability\nto take capital\nactions or may modify\nor impose other\nregulatory standards\nor restrictions that\nincrease our operating\nexpenses or constrain\nour ability to take\ncapital actions.

In\naddition to the\nmonetary consequences,\nthese measures could\ncause collateral\nconsequences. For\nexample, such matters\ncould impact our\nability to engage in,\nor impose limitations\non, certain of our\nbusinesses.\n\nThese investigations\nand proceedings, as\nwell as the amount of\npenalties and fines\nsought, continue to\nimpact the financial\nservices industry, and\ncertain U.S. and\ninternational\ngovernmental entities\nhave brought criminal\nactions against, or\nhave sought criminal\nconvictions, pleas or\ndeferred prosecution\nagreements from,\nfinancial\ninstitutions.\nSignificant regulatory\nor law enforcement\naction against us\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition or results\nof operations or cause\nus significant\nreputational harm,\nwhich could seriously\nharm our business.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nalso provides\ncompensation to\nwhistleblowers who\npresent the SEC or\nCFTC with information\nrelated to securities\nor commodities law\nviolations that leads\nto a successful\nenforcement action. As\na result of this\ncompensation, it is\npossible we could face\nan increased number of\ninvestigations by the\nSEC or CFTC.\n\nWe have been named,\nfrom time to time, as\na defendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, as well as\ninvestigations or\nproceedings brought by\nregulatory agencies,\narising in connection\nwith our activities as\na global diversified\nfinancial services\ninstitution.

In\nother cases, including\nantitrust litigation,\nwe may be subject to\nclaims for joint and\nseveral liability with\nother defendants for\ntreble damages or\nother relief related\nto alleged\nconspiracies involving\nother institutions.\nLike any large\ncorporation, we are\nalso subject to risk\nfrom potential\nemployee misconduct,\nincluding non-\ncompliance with\npolicies, laws, rules\nand regulations, and\nimproper use or\ndisclosure of\nconfidential\ninformation, or\nimproper sales\npractices or other\nconduct.\n\nWe may be responsible\nfor representations\nand warranties\nassociated with\ncommercial and\nresidential real\nestate loans and may\nincur losses in excess\nof our reserves.\n\nWe originate loans\nsecured by commercial\nand residential\nproperties. Further,\nwe securitize and\ntrade in a wide range\nof commercial and\nresidential real\nestate and real\nestate-related assets\nand products. In\nconnection with these\nactivities, we have\nprovided, or otherwise\nagreed to be\nresponsible for,\ncertain\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. Under\ncertain circumstances,\nwe may be required to\nrepurchase such assets\nor make other payments\nrelated to such assets\nif such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties were\nbreached, and may\nincur losses as a\nresult. We have also\nmade representations\nand warranties in\nconnection with our\nrole as an originator\nof certain loans that\nwe securitized in CMBS\nand RMBS. For\nadditional\ninformation, see Note\n15 to the financial\nstatements.\n\nA failure to address\nconflicts of interest\nappropriately could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and\nreputation.\n\nAs a global financial\nservices firm that\nprovides products and\nservices to a large\nand diversified group\nof clients, including\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nindividuals, we face\npotential conflicts of\ninterest in the normal\ncourse of business.\nFor example, potential\nconflicts can occur\nwhen there is a\ndivergence of\ninterests between us\nand a client, among\nclients, between an\nemployee on the one\nhand and us or a\nclient on the other,\nor situations in which\nwe may be a creditor\nof a client. Moreover,\nwe utilize multiple\nbrands and business\nchannels, including\nthose resulting from\nour acquisitions, and\ncontinue to enhance\nthe collaboration\nacross business\nsegments, which may\nheighten the potential\nconflicts of interest\nor the risk of\nimproper sharing of\ninformation.\n\nWe have policies,\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest,\nand we utilize various\nmeasures, such as the\nuse of disclosure, to\nmanage these potential\nconflicts. However,\nidentifying and\nmitigating potential\nconflicts of interest\ncan be complex and\nchallenging and can\nbecome the focus of\nmedia and regulatory\nscrutiny. Indeed,\nactions that merely\nappear to\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    16  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncreate a conflict can\nput our reputation at\nrisk even if the\nlikelihood of an\nactual conflict has\nbeen mitigated. It is\npossible that\npotential conflicts\ncould give rise to\nlitigation or\nenforcement actions,\nwhich may lead to our\nclients being less\nwilling to enter into\ntransactions in which\na conflict may occur\nand could adversely\naffect our businesses\nand reputation.\n\nOur regulators also\nhave the ability to\nscrutinize our\nactivities for\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nthrough detailed\nexaminations of\nspecific transactions.\nFor example, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve\nsubjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve\nscrutiny with respect\nto transactions\nbetween our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates. Further,\nthe Volcker Rule\nsubjects us to\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding certain\ntransactions between\nus and our clients.\n                                              \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nOur risk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposures in all\nmarket environments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, which could\nresult in unexpected\nlosses.\n\nWe have devoted\nsignificant resources\nto develop our risk\nmanagement\ncapabilities and\nexpect to continue to\ndo so in the future.\nNonetheless, our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nmodels and processes,\nincluding our use of\nvarious risk models\nfor assessing market,\ncredit, liquidity and\noperational exposures\nand hedging\nstrategies, stress\ntesting and other\nanalysis, may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposure in all market\nenvironments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, including risks\nthat are unidentified\nor unanticipated.\n\nAs our businesses\nchange and grow,\nincluding through\nacquisitions, and the\nmarkets in which we\noperate evolve, our\nrisk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not\nalways adapt with\nthose changes. Some of\nour methods of\nmanaging risk are\nbased upon our use of\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\nAs a result, these\nmethods may not\npredict future risk\nexposures, which could\nbe significantly\ngreater than the\nhistorical measures\nindicate.\n\nIn addition, many\nmodels we use are\nbased on assumptions\nor inputs regarding\ncorrelations among\nprices of various\nasset classes or other\nmarket indicators and,\ntherefore, cannot\nanticipate sudden,\nunanticipated, or\nunidentified market or\neconomic movements,\nsuch as the impact of\na pandemic or a sudden\ngeopolitical conflict,\nwhich could cause us\nto incur losses.\n\nManagement of market,\ncredit, liquidity,\noperational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and\ncompliance risks\nrequires, among other\nthings, policies and\nprocedures to record\nproperly and verify a\nlarge number of\ntransactions and\nevents, and these\npolicies and\nprocedures may not be\nfully effective. Our\ntrading risk\nmanagement strategies\nand techniques also\nseek to balance\n\nour ability to profit\nfrom trading positions\nwith our exposure to\npotential losses.\n\nWhile we employ a\nbroad and diversified\nset of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the timing\nof such outcomes. For\nexample, to the extent\nthat our trading or\ninvesting activities\ninvolve less liquid\ntrading markets or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sales\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and,\ntherefore, reduce our\nrisk associated with\nsuch positions. We\nmay, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course\nof our trading or\ninvesting activities.\nFor more information\non how we monitor and\nmanage market and\ncertain other risks\nand related\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Market Risk.\u201d\n\nClimate change\nmanifesting as\nphysical or transition\nrisks could result in\nincreased costs and\nrisks and adversely\naffect our operations,\nbusinesses and\nclients.\n\nThere continues to be\nincreasing concern\nover the risks of\nclimate change and\nrelated environmental\nsustainability\nmatters. The physical\nrisks of climate\nchange include harm to\npeople and property\narising from acute,\nclimate-related\nevents, such as\nfloods, hurricanes,\nheatwaves, wildfires,\nand chronic, longer-\nterm shifts in climate\npatterns, such as\nhigher global average\ntemperatures, rising\nsea levels, and\ndroughts. Such events\ncould disrupt our\noperations or those of\nour clients or third-\nparties on which we\nrely, including\nthrough direct damage\nto physical assets and\nindirect impacts from\nsupply chain\ndisruption and market\nvolatility. Over the\nlonger term, these\nevents could impact\nthe ability of certain\nof our clients or\ncustomers to repay\ntheir obligations,\nreduce the value of\ncollateral, limit\ninsurance coverage and\nresult in other\neffects.\n\nAdditionally,\ntransitioning to a\nlow-carbon economy\nwill likely require\nextensive policy,\nlegal, technology and\nmarket changes.\nTransition risks,\nincluding changes in\nconsumer and business\nsentiment, related\ntechnologies,\nshareholder\npreferences, and any\nadditional regulatory\nand legislative\nrequirements,\nincluding carbon\ntaxes, could increase\nour expenses and\nadversely impact our\nstrategies, including\nby limiting our\nability to pursue\ncertain business\nactivities or offer\ncertain products and\nservices. Over the\nlonger term, negative\nimpacts to certain of\nour clients, such as\ndecreased\nprofitability and\nstranded assets, could\nalso lead to increased\ncredit and\ncounterparty risk to\nus.\n\nIn addition, our\nreputation and client\nrelationships may be\nadversely impacted as\na result of our\npractices related to\nclimate change,\nincluding our\ninvolvement, or our\nclients\u2019 involvement,\nin certain industries,\nprojects, or\ninitiatives associated\nwith causing, or\npotentially slowing\nsolutions to, climate\nchange, as well as any\ndecisions we make to\ncontinue to conduct or\nchange our activities\nin response to\nconsiderations\nrelating to climate\nchange. Legislative or\n                                 \n  17    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nregulatory\nuncertainties and\nchange regarding\nclimate-related risks,\nincluding inconsistent\nperspectives or\nrequirements, are\nlikely to result in\nhigher regulatory,\ncompliance, credit,\nreputational and other\nrisks and costs.\n\nOur ability to achieve\nour long-term climate-\nrelated goals and\ncommitments could also\nresult in reputational\nharm as a result of\npublic sentiment,\nregulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation and reduced\ninvestor and\nstakeholder\nconfidence. If we are\nunable to achieve our\nobjectives relating to\nclimate change or our\ncurrent response to\nclimate change is\nperceived to be\nineffective or\ninsufficient, our\nbusiness and\nreputation may suffer.\n\nThe risks associated\nwith, and the\nperspective of\nregulators,\ngovernments,\nshareholders,\nemployees and other\nstakeholders\nregarding, climate\nchange are continuing\nto evolve rapidly,\nwhich can make it\ndifficult to assess\nthe ultimate impact on\nus of climate change-\nrelated risks and\nuncertainties. As\nclimate risk is\ninterconnected with\nother risk types,\nincluding geopolitical\nrisks, we have\ndeveloped and continue\nto enhance processes\nto embed climate risk\nconsiderations into\nour risk management\nstrategies for risks\nsuch as market, credit\nand operational risks,\nas well as our\ngovernance structures.\nDespite our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nthe unpredictability\nsurrounding the timing\nand severity of\nclimate change events\nand societal or\npolitical changes in\nreaction to them make\nit difficult to\npredict, identify,\nmonitor and\neffectively mitigate\nclimate risk exposure.\n\nIn addition, the\nmethodologies and data\nused to manage and\nmonitor climate risk\nare still in early\nstages and continue to\nevolve. Current\napproaches utilize\ninformation and\nestimates that have\nbeen derived from\ninformation or factors\nreleased by third-\nparty sources, which\nmay not reflect the\nlatest or most\naccurate data.\nClimate-related data,\nparticularly\ngreenhouse gas\nemissions for clients\nand counterparties,\nremains limited in\navailability and\nvariable in quality.\nCertain third-party\ninformation may also\nchange over time as\nmethodologies evolve\nand are refined. While\nwe believe this\ninformation is the\nbest available at the\ntime, we may only be\nable to complete\nlimited validation.\nFurthermore, modeling\ncapabilities and\nmethodologies to\nanalyze climate-\nrelated risks,\nalthough improving,\nremain nascent and\nemerging. These and\nother factors could\ncause results to\ndiffer materially from\nthose expressed in the\nestimates and beliefs\nmade by third-parties\nand by us, which could\nalso impact our\nmanagement of risk in\nthis area.\n\nReplacement of London\nInterbank Offered Rate\nand replacement or\nreform of other\ninterest rate\nbenchmarks could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations.\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave sponsored\ninitiatives in recent\nyears to replace LIBOR\nand replace or reform\ncertain other interest\nrate benchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from use of the\nIBORs to alternative\nrates and other\npotential\n\ninterest rate\nbenchmark reforms is\nunderway and is a\nmulti-year initiative.\nThese reforms have\ncaused and may in the\nfuture cause such\nrates to perform\ndifferently than in\nthe past, or to cease\nentirely, or have\nother consequences\nthat are contrary to\nmarket expectations.\n\nThe ongoing market\ntransition away from\nIBORs and other\ninterest rate\nbenchmarks to\nalternative reference\nrates is complex and\ncould have a range of\nadverse impacts on our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations. In\nparticular, such\ntransition or reform\ncould:\n\n\u2022 Adversely impact the\npricing, liquidity,\nvalue of, return on\nand trading for a\nbroad array of\nfinancial products,\nincluding any IBOR-\nlinked securities,\nloans and derivatives\nthat are included in\nour financial assets\nand liabilities;\n\n\u2022 Require further\nextensive changes to\ndocumentation that\ngoverns or references\nIBOR or IBOR-based\nproducts, including,\nfor example, pursuant\nto time-consuming\nrenegotiations of\nexisting documentation\nto modify the terms of\noutstanding securities\nand related hedging\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 Result in a\npopulation of products\nwith documentation\nthat governs or\nreferences IBOR or\nIBOR-based products\nbut that cannot be\namended due to an\ninability to obtain\nsufficient consent\nfrom counterparties or\nproduct owners;\n\n\u2022 Result in inquiries,\nreviews or other\nactions from\nregulators in respect\nof our (or the\nmarket\u2019s) preparation,\nreadiness, transition\nplans and actions\nregarding the\nreplacement of an IBOR\nwith one or more\nalternative reference\nrates, including\nregulatory guidance\nregarding constraints\non the entry into new\nU.S. dollar IBOR-\nlinked contracts after\nDecember 31, 2021;\n\n\u2022 Result in disputes,\nlitigation or other\nactions with clients,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors in various\nscenarios, such as\nregarding the\ninterpretation and\nenforceability of\nprovisions in IBOR-\nbased products such as\nfallback language or\nother related\nprovisions, including\nin the case of\nfallbacks to the\nalternative reference\nrates, any economic,\nlegal, operational or\nother impact resulting\nfrom the fundamental\ndifferences between\nthe IBORs and the\nvarious alternative\nreference rates;\n\n\u2022 Require the\nadditional transition\nand/or further\ndevelopment of\nappropriate systems\nand analytics to\neffectively transition\nour risk management\nprocesses from IBORs\nto those based on one\nor more alternative\nreference rates in a\ntimely manner,\nincluding by\nquantifying value and\nrisk for various\nalternative reference\nrates, which may prove\nchallenging given the\nlimited history of the\nproposed alternative\nreference rates; and\n\n\u2022 Cause us to incur\nadditional costs in\nrelation to any of the\nabove factors.\n\nOther factors include\nthe pace of the\ntransition to the\nalternative reference\nrates, timing\nmismatches between\ncash and derivative\nmarkets, the specific\nterms and parameters\nfor and market\nacceptance of any\nalternative reference\nrate, market\nconventions for the\nuse of any alternative\nreference rate in\nconnection with a\nparticular product\n(including the\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    18  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntiming and market\nadoption of any\nconventions proposed\nor recommended by any\nindustry or other\ngroup), prices of and\nthe liquidity of\ntrading markets for\nproducts based on\nalternative reference\nrates, and our ability\nto further transition\nand develop\nappropriate systems\nand analytics for one\nor more alternative\nreference rates.\n\nSee also \u201cManagement's\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Regulatory \nRequirements\u2014Regulator\ny Developments and\nOther Matters\u201d herein.\n                                              \n  Competitive Environment                     \n                                              \nWe face strong\ncompetition from\nfinancial services\nfirms and others,\nwhich could lead to\npricing pressures that\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nrevenues and\nprofitability.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry and all\naspects of our\nbusinesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. We compete\nwith commercial banks,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, brokerage\nfirms, insurance\ncompanies, exchanges,\nelectronic trading and\nclearing platforms,\nfinancial data\nrepositories, sponsors\nof mutual funds, hedge\nfunds, real assets\nfunds and private\ncredit and equity\nfunds, energy\ncompanies, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial or\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally,\nincluding through the\ninternet.

We compete\non the basis of\nseveral factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, capital or\naccess to capital,\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\ntechnology,\nreputation, risk\nappetite and price.\n\nOver time, certain\nsectors of the\nfinancial services\nindustry have become\nmore concentrated, as\ninstitutions involved\nin a broad range of\nfinancial services\nhave left businesses,\nbeen acquired by or\nmerged into other\nfirms, or have\ndeclared bankruptcy.\nSuch changes could\nresult in our\nremaining competitors\ngaining greater\ncapital and other\nresources, such as the\nability to offer a\nbroader range of\nproducts and services\nand geographic\ndiversity, or new\ncompetitors may\nemerge.\n\nWe have experienced\nand may continue to\nexperience pricing\npressures as a result\nof these factors and\nas some of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nreducing prices,\neliminating\ncommissions or other\nfees, or providing\nmore favorable terms\nof business. In\naddition, certain of\nour competitors may be\nsubject to different\nand, in some cases,\nless stringent, legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan we are, thereby\nputting us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage. Some new\ncompetitors in the\nfinancial technology\nsector have sought to\ntarget existing\nsegments of our\nbusinesses that could\nbe susceptible to\ndisruption by\ninnovative or less\nregulated business\nmodels.

In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities\nand other automated\ntrading platforms, and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies will\nlikely continue the\npressure on revenues.\nThe trend toward\ndirect access to\nautomated, electronic\nmarkets will likely\ncontinue as additional\nmarkets move to more\nautomated trading\nplatforms.

From\ntime to time, we may\ndisclose certain \u201cnon-\nGAAP financial\nmeasures\u201d in this\ndocument or in the\ncourse of our earnings\nreleases, earnings and\nother conference\ncalls, financial\npresentations,\ndefinitive proxy\nstatement and\notherwise. A \u201cnon-GAAP\nfinancial measure\u201d\nexcludes, or includes,\namounts from the most\ndirectly comparable\nmeasure calculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP. We consider the\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures we disclose\nto be useful to us,\ninvestors, analysts\nand other stakeholders\nby providing further\ntransparency about, or\nan alternate means of\nassessing or comparing\nour financial\ncondition, operating\nresults and capital\nadequacy.\n\nThese measures are not\nin accordance with, or\na substitute for, U.S.\nGAAP and may be\ndifferent from or\ninconsistent with non-\nGAAP financial\nmeasures used by other\ncompanies. Whenever we\nrefer to a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, we\nwill also generally\ndefine it or present\nthe most directly\ncomparable financial\nmeasure calculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP, along with a\nreconciliation of the\ndifferences between\nthe U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measure and\nthe non-GAAP financial\nmeasure.\n\nIn the fourth quarter\nof 2022, we introduced\nnew non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. These\nmeasures exclude the\nimpact of mark-to-\nmarket gains and\nlosses on investments\nassociated with\ncertain employee\ndeferred cash-based\ncompensation plans\nfrom net revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nThese employee\ndeferred cash-based\ncompensation plans are\nprimarily reflected in\nour Wealth Management\nbusiness segment. We\nconsider these new\nmeasures useful for\nanalysts, investors,\nand other stakeholders\nto allow better\ncomparability of\nperiod-to-period\nunderlying operating\nperformance and\nrevenue trends,\nespecially in our\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment. By\nexcluding the impact\nof these items we are\nbetter able to\ndescribe the business\ndrivers and resulting\nimpact to net revenues\nand corresponding\nchange to the\nassociated\ncompensation expenses.\n\nCompensation expense\nfor deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nawards is calculated\nbased on the notional\nvalue of the award\ngranted, adjusted for\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of the\n\nreferenced investments\nthat employees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards.\n\nWe invest directly, as\na principal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of our\nobligations under\nthese deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nplans. Changes in the\nfair value of such\ninvestments, net of\nfinancing costs, are\nrecorded in Net\nrevenues, and included\nin Transactional\nrevenues in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nrecognized in net\nrevenues, there is\ntypically a timing\ndifference between the\nimmediate recognition\nof gains and losses on\nour investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nmay not be material to\nour Income before\nprovision for income\ntaxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment reported\nratios and operating\nmetrics in certain\nperiods due to\npotentially\nsignificant impacts to\nnet revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nFor additional\ninformation on\ndeferred cash-based\ncompensation, refer to\n\u201cOther Matters\u201d\nherein.\n\nThe principal non-GAAP\nfinancial measures\npresented in this\ndocument are set forth\nin the following\ntables.\n

Asset management revenues are\ninfluenced by the level and relative mix of\nAUM and related fee rates. The current market\nenvironment may impact AUM and net flows\nwithin asset classes and therefore our asset\nmanagement revenues. See \u201cAssets under\nManagement or Supervision\u201d herein.\nPerformance-based Income and Other\nPerformance-based income and other revenues\nwere $43 million in 2022, representing a 93%\ndecrease from the prior year, primarily due to\nlower accrued carried interest in certain\nprivate equity and real estate funds, losses\non investments associated with certain\nemployee deferred cash-based compensation\nplans, and mark-to-market losses on public\ninvestments. Non-interest Expenses Non-\ninterest expenses of $4,568 million in 2022\nwere relatively unchanged from the prior year\nperiod, reflecting higher Non-compensation\nexpenses offset by lower Compensation and\nbenefits. \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower discretionary\nincentive compensation driven by lower asset\nmanagement revenues and lower compensation\nassociated with carried interest, partially\noffset by the impact of incremental\ncompensation as a result of the Eaton Vance\nacquisition. \u2022 Non-compensation expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher marketing\nand business development costs and incremental\nexpenses as a result of the Eaton Vance\nacquisition.\n                                 \n  35    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAssets under\nManagement or\nSupervision\nRollforwards\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n1.

We invest\ndirectly, as a\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of our\nobligations under\nthese deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nplans. Changes in the\nfair value of such\ninvestments, net of\nfinancing costs, are\nrecorded in Net\nrevenues, and included\nin Transactional\nrevenues in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nrecognized in net\nrevenues, there is\ntypically a timing\ndifference between the\nimmediate recognition\nof gains and losses on\nour investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nmay not be material to\nour Income before\nprovision for income\ntaxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment reported\nratios and operating\nmetrics in certain\nperiods due to\npotentially\nsignificant impacts to\nnet revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nAt December 31, 2022,\nsubstantially all\nemployee notional\ninvestments that\nsubjected the Firm to\nprice risk were\neconomically hedged.\nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026       2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deferr\u2026                                     \n  cash-b\u2026    $   761    $    810    $  1,263  \n  awards                                      \n  Return                                      \n  on            -716         526         856  \n  refere\u2026                                     \n  invest\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $    45    $  1,336    $  2,119  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\nby Segment\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026       2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Instit\u2026    $   -97    $    372    $    851  \n  Securi\u2026                                     \n  Wealth          11         798       1,000  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Invest\u2026        131         166         268  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $    45    $  1,336    $  2,119  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \n                                 \n  37    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nProjected Future\nCompensation\nObligation 1\n                                              \n  $ in millions                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Award liabilities at December     $  4,880  \n  31, 20222, 3                                \n  Fully vested amounts to be                  \n  distributed by the end                -729  \n  of February 20234                           \n  Unrecognized portion of prior               \n  awards at December                   1,096  \n  31, 20223                                   \n  2022 performance year awards           384  \n  granted in 20233                            \n  Total5                            $  5,631  \n                                              \n1.

We adopted the\nfollowing accounting updates on January 1,\n2023: \u2022 Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses.\nThis accounting update eliminates the\naccounting guidance for Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and requires new\ndisclosures regarding certain modifications of\nfinancing receivables ( i.e. , principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-\nthan-insignificant payment delays and term\nextensions) to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The update also requires\ndisclosure of current period gross charge-offs\nby year of origination for financing\nreceivables measured at amortized cost. We\nadopted this update on a prospective basis and\nnoted no impact on our financial condition or\nresults of operation upon adoption. We are\ncurrently evaluating the following accounting\nupdate, however, we do not expect a material\nimpact on our financial condition or results\nof operations upon adoption: \u2022 Fair Value\nMeasurement . This accounting update clarifies\nthat a contractual restriction on the sale of\nan equity security is not considered part of\nthe unit of account of the equity security\nand, therefore, is not considered in measuring\nfair value. The update also requires\nadditional disclosures including the fair\nvalue of equity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions, the nature and\nremaining duration of the restriction and\ncircumstances that could cause the restriction\nto lapse. The ASU is effective January 1, 2024\nwith early adoption permitted. Critical\nAccounting Estimates Our financial statements\nare prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP,\nwhich requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions (see Note 1 to the financial\nstatements). We believe that of our\nsignificant accounting policies (see Note 2 to\nthe financial statements), the following\npolicies involve a higher degree of judgment\nand complexity. Fair Value Financial\nInstruments Measured at Fair Value A\nsignificant number of our financial\ninstruments are carried at fair value. The use\nof fair value to measure financial instruments\nis fundamental to our risk management\npractices and is our most critical accounting\nestimate. We make estimates regarding the\nvaluation of assets and liabilities measured\nat fair value in preparing the financial\nstatements. These assets and liabilities\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    38  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n\u2022 Trading assets and\nTrading liabilities;\n\n\u2022 Investment\nSecurities\u2014AFS;\n\n\u2022 Certain Securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell;\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n(measured at the lower\nof amortized cost or\nfair value);\n\n\u2022 Certain Deposits,\nprimarily certificates\nof deposit;\n\n\u2022 Certain Securities\nsold under agreements\nto repurchase;\n\n\u2022 Certain Other\nsecured financings;\nand\n\n\u2022 Certain Borrowings.\n\nFair value is defined\nas the price that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability ( i.e. , the\nexit price) in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date.\n\nIn determining fair\nvalue, we use various\nvaluation approaches.\nA hierarchy for inputs\nis used in measuring\nfair value that\nmaximizes the use of\nobservable prices and\ninputs and minimizes\nthe use of\nunobservable prices\nand inputs by\nrequiring that the\nrelevant observable\ninputs be used when\navailable. The\nhierarchy is broken\ndown into three\nlevels, wherein Level\n1 represents quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets, Level 2\nrepresents valuations\nbased on quoted prices\nin markets that are\nnot active or for\nwhich all significant\ninputs are observable,\nand Level 3 consists\nof valuation\ntechniques that\nincorporate\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nand, therefore,\nrequire the greatest\nuse of judgment. The\nfair values for the\nsubstantial majority\nof our financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value\nare based on\nobservable prices and\ninputs and are\nclassified in level 1\nor 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.4% and\n1.1% of our total\nassets, as of December\n31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nIn periods of market\ndisruption, the\nobservability of\nprices and inputs, as\nwell as market\nliquidity may be\nreduced for many\ninstruments, which\ncould cause an\ninstrument to be\nrecategorized from\nLevel 1 to Level 2 or\nfrom Level 2 to Level\n3. In addition, a\ndownturn in market\nconditions could lead\nto declines in the\nvaluation of many\ninstruments carried at\nfair value.\nImprecision in\nestimating\nunobservable market\ninputs or other\nfactors can affect the\namount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a\nparticular position.\nThe Firm uses various\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in the\ndetermination of fair\nvalue. The use of\nmethodologies or\nassumptions different\nthan those used by the\nFirm could result in a\ndifferent estimate of\nfair value at the\nreporting date. For\nfurther information on\nthe definition of fair\nvalue, Level 1, Level\n2, Level 3 and related\nvaluation techniques,\nand quantitative\ninformation about and\nsensitivity of\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nused in Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements,\nsee Notes 2 and 5 to\nthe financial\nstatements.\n\nWhere appropriate,\nvaluation adjustments\nare made to account\nfor various factors\nsuch as liquidity risk\n(bid-ask adjustments),\ncredit quality, model\nuncertainty,\nconcentration risk and\nfunding in order to\narrive at fair value.\nFor a further\ndiscussion of\nvaluation adjustments\nthat we apply, see\nNote 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Intangible Assets              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe test goodwill for\nimpairment on an\nannual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\nEvaluating goodwill\nfor impairment\nrequires management to\nmake significant\njudgments, including,\nin part, the use of\nunobservable inputs\nthat are subject to\nuncertainty. Goodwill\nimpairment tests are\nperformed at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below our\nbusiness segments.\nGoodwill no longer\nretains its\nassociation with a\nparticular acquisition\nonce it has been\nassigned to a\nreporting unit. As\nsuch, all the\nactivities of a\nreporting unit,\nwhether acquired or\norganically developed,\nare available to\nsupport the value of\nthe goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, we\nhave the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\n\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, we\ncompare the fair value\nof a reporting unit\nwith its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited by the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\n\nThe carrying value of\neach reporting unit is\ndetermined based on\nthe capital allocated\nto the reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunits is derived based\non valuation\ntechniques we believe\nmarket participants\nwould use for each of\nthe reporting units.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue is generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology.\nIn certain instances,\nwe may also utilize\nmethodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncertain comparable\ncompanies.\n\nThe discounted cash\nflow methodology uses\nprojected future cash\nflows based on the\nreporting units\u2019\nearnings forecast.

In such\ncases, the remaining\ncarrying amount is\namortized\nprospectively over the\nrevised useful life,\nunless it is\ndetermined that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is indefinite,\nin which case the\nintangible asset is\nnot amortized.\n\n\u2022 Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is no longer\nindefinite; in such\ncases, the carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\namortized\nprospectively over its\nremaining useful life.\n\nThe initial valuation\nof an intangible asset\nas part of the\nacquisition method of\naccounting and the\nsubsequent valuation\nof intangible assets\nas part of an\nimpairment assessment\nare subjective and\nbased, in part, on\ninputs that are\nunobservable and can\nbe subject to\nuncertainty. These\ninputs include, but\nare not limited to,\nforecasted cash flows,\nrevenue growth rates,\ncustomer attrition\nrates and discount\nrates.\n\nFor both goodwill and\nintangible assets, to\nthe extent an\nimpairment loss is\nrecognized, the loss\nestablishes the new\ncost basis of the\nasset. Subsequent\nreversal of impairment\nlosses is not\npermitted. For\namortizable intangible\nassets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized\nover the remaining\nuseful life of that\nasset. Unanticipated\ndeclines in our\nrevenue generating\ncapability, adverse\nmarket or economic\nevents, and regulatory\nactions, could result\nin material impairment\ncharges in future\nperiods.\n\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 11\nto the financial\nstatements for\nadditional information\nabout goodwill and\nintangible assets.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Contingencies          \n                                              \nIn the normal course\nof business, we have\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with our\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\n\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress.\n\nWe are also involved,\nfrom time to time, in\nother reviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding our\nbusiness and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, investment\nbanking advisory\nservices, capital\nmarkets activities,\nsales, trading,\nfinancing, prime-\nbrokerage, market-\nmaking activities,\nwealth and investment\nmanagement services,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby us, and accounting\nand operational\nmatters, certain of\nwhich may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief.\n\nAccruals for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nare generally\ndetermined on a case-\nby-case basis. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand we can reasonably\nestimate the amount of\nthat loss, we accrue\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\ndeciding when and if\nto make these\naccruals, and the\nactual cost of a legal\nclaim or regulatory\nfine/penalty may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals.\n\nSee Note 15 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation on legal\ncontingencies.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nWe are subject to the\nincome and indirect\ntax laws of the U.S.,\nits states and\nmunicipalities and\nthose of the foreign\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    40  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \njurisdictions in which\nwe have significant\nbusiness operations.\nThese tax laws are\ncomplex and subject to\ninterpretation by the\ntaxpayer and the\nrelevant governmental\ntaxing authorities. We\nmust make judgments\nand interpretations\nabout the application\nof these inherently\ncomplex tax laws when\ndetermining the\nprovision for income\ntaxes and the expense\nfor indirect taxes and\nmust also make\nestimates about when\ncertain items affect\ntaxable income in the\nvarious tax\njurisdictions.\nDisputes over\ninterpretations of the\ntax laws may be\nsettled with the\ntaxing authority upon\nexamination or audit.\nWe periodically\nevaluate the\nlikelihood of\nassessments in each\ntaxing jurisdiction\nresulting from current\nand subsequent years\u2019\nexaminations, and\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits related to\npotential losses that\nmay arise from tax\naudits are established\nin accordance with the\nrelevant accounting\nguidance. Once\nestablished,\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits are adjusted\nwhen there is more\ninformation available\nor when an event\noccurs requiring a\nchange. Our provision\nfor income taxes is\ncomposed of current\nand deferred taxes.\nCurrent income taxes\napproximate taxes to\nbe paid or refunded\nfor the current\nperiod. Deferred\nincome taxes reflect\nthe net tax effects of\ntemporary differences\nbetween the financial\nreporting and tax\nbases of assets and\nliabilities and are\nmeasured using the\napplicable enacted tax\nrates and laws that\nwill be in effect when\nsuch differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nOur deferred tax\nbalances may also\ninclude deferred\nassets related to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards, such as\nnet operating losses\nand tax credits that\nwill be realized\nthrough reduction of\nfuture tax liabilities\nand, in some cases,\nare subject to\nexpiration if not\nutilized within\ncertain periods. We\nperform regular\nreviews to ascertain\nwhether deferred tax\nassets are realizable.\nThese reviews include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions\nregarding future\ntaxable income and\nincorporate various\ntax planning\nstrategies, including\nstrategies that may be\navailable to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards before\nthey expire. Once the\ndeferred tax asset\nbalances have been\ndetermined, we may\nrecord a valuation\nallowance against the\ndeferred tax asset\nbalances to reflect\nthe amount we estimate\nis more likely than\nnot to be realized at\na future date. Both\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes may\nreflect adjustments\nrelated to our\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits. Significant\njudgment is required\nin estimating the\nconsolidated provision\nfor (benefit from)\nincome taxes, current\nand deferred tax\nbalances (including\nvaluation allowance,\nif any), accrued\ninterest or penalties\nand uncertain tax\npositions. Revisions\nin estimates and/or\nthe actual costs of a\ntax assessment may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals and\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits, if any.

Other assets primarily\nincludes Goodwill and Intangible assets,\npremises, equipment and software, ROU assets\nrelated to leases, other investments and\ndeferred tax assets. A substantial portion of\ntotal assets consists of cash and cash\nequivalents, liquid marketable securities and\nshort-term receivables. In the Institutional\nSecurities business segment, these arise from\nmarket-making, financing and prime brokerage\nactivities, and in the Wealth Management\nbusiness segment, these arise from banking\nactivities, including management of the\ninvestment portfolio. Total assets of $1,180\nbillion at December 31, 2022 were relati vely\nunchanged from $1,188 billion at December 31,\n2021. Liquidity Risk Management Framework The\nprimary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management\nFramework is to ensure that we have access to\nadequate funding across a wide range of market\nconditions and time horizons. The framework is\ndesigned to enable us to fulfill our financial\nobligations and support the execution of our\nbusiness strategies. The following principles\nguide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:\n\u2022 Sufficient Liquidity Resources should be\nmaintained to cover maturing liabilities and\nother planned and contingent outflows; \u2022\nMaturity profile of assets and liabilities\nshould be aligned, with limited reliance on\nshort-term funding; \u2022 Source, counterparty,\ncurrency, region and term of funding should be\ndiversified; and \u2022 Liquidity Stress Tests\nshould anticipate, and account for, periods of\nlimited access to funding. The core components\nof our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are\nthe Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity\nStress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which\nsupport our target liquidity profile. Required\nLiquidity Framework Our Required Liquidity\nFramework establishes the amount of liquidity\nwe must hold in both normal and stressed\nenvironments to ensure that our financial\ncondition and overall soundness are not\nadversely affected by an inability\n\n(or perceived inability) to meet our financial\nobligations in a timely manner. The Required\nLiquidity Framework considers the most\nconstraining liquidity requirement to satisfy\nall regulatory and internal limits at a\nconsolidated and legal entity level. Liquidity\nStress Tests We use Liquidity Stress Tests to\nmodel external and intercompany liquidity\nflows across multiple scenarios and a range of\ntime horizons. These scenarios contain various\ncombinations of idiosyncratic and systemic\nstress events of different severity and\nduration. The methodology, implementation,\nproduction and analysis of our Liquidity\nStress Tests are important components of the\nRequired Liquidity Framework. The assumptions\nused in our various Liquidity Stress Test\nscenarios include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: \u2022 No government support; \u2022 No\naccess to equity and limited access to\nunsecured debt markets; \u2022 Repayment of all\nunsecured debt maturing within the stress\nhorizon; \u2022 Higher haircuts for and\nsignificantly lower availability of secured\nfunding; \u2022 Additional collateral that would be\nrequired by trading counterparties, certain\nexchanges and clearing organizations related\nto credit rating downgrades; \u2022 Additional\ncollateral that would be required due to\ncollateral substitutions, collateral disputes\nand uncalled collateral; \u2022 Discretionary\nunsecured debt buybacks; \u2022 Drawdowns on\nlending commitments provided to third parties;\nand \u2022 Client cash withdrawals and reduction in\ncustomer short positions that fund long\npositions. Liquidity Stress Tests are produced\nand results are reported at different levels,\nincluding major operating subsidiaries and\nmajor currencies, to capture specific cash\nrequirements and cash availability across the\nFirm, including a limited number of asset\nsales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity\nStress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use\ntheir own liquidity first to fund their\nobligations before drawing liquidity from the\nParent Company and that the Parent Company\nwill support its subsidiaries and will not\nhave access to subsidiaries\u2019 liquidity\nreserves. In addition to the assumptions\nunderpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we\ntake into consideration settlement risk\nrelated to intraday settlement and clearing of\nsecurities and financing activities. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we\nmaintained sufficient Liquidity Resources to\nmeet current and contingent funding\nobligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress\nTests.\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    42  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nLiquidity Resources We\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity resources,\nwhich consist of HQLA\nand cash deposits with\nbanks (\u201cLiquidity\nResources\u201d) to cover\ndaily funding needs\nand to meet strategic\nliquidity targets\nsized by the Required\nLiquidity Framework\nand Liquidity Stress\nTests. We actively\nmanage the amount of\nour Liquidity\nResources considering\nthe following\ncomponents: unsecured\ndebt maturity profile;\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition; funding\nneeds in a stressed\nenvironment, inclusive\nof contingent cash\noutflows; legal\nentity, regional and\nsegment liquidity\nrequirements;\nregulatory\nrequirements; and\ncollateral\nrequirements. The\namount of Liquidity\nResources we hold is\nbased on our risk\nappetite and is\ncalibrated to meet\nvarious internal and\nregulatory\nrequirements and to\nfund prospective\nbusiness activities.\nThe Liquidity\nResources are\nprimarily held within\nthe Parent Company and\nits major operating\nsubsidiaries.

We\npursue a strategy of\ndiversification of\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding sources (by\nproduct, investor and\nregion) and attempt to\nensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities\nequals or exceeds the\nexpected holding\nperiod of the assets\nbeing financed. Our\ngoal is to achieve an\noptimal mix of durable\nsecured and unsecured\nfinancing. We fund our\nbalance sheet on a\nglobal basis through\ndiverse sources. These\nsources include our\nequity capital,\nborrowings, securities\nsold under agreements\nto repurchase,\nsecurities lending,\ndeposits, letters of\ncredit and lines of\ncredit. We have active\nfinancing programs for\nboth standard and\nstructured products\ntargeting global\ninvestors and\ncurrencies.

Secured\nfinancing investors\nprincipally focus on\nthe quality of the\neligible collateral\nposted. Accordingly,\nwe actively manage our\nsecured financings\nbased on the quality\nof the assets being\nfunded. We have\nestablished longer\ntenor secured funding\nrequirements for less\nliquid asset classes,\nfor which funding may\nbe at risk in the\nevent of a market\ndisruption. We define\nhighly liquid assets\nas government-issued\nor government-\nguaranteed securities\nwith a high degree of\nfundability and less\nliquid assets as those\nthat do not meet these\ncriteria. To further\nminimize the\nrefinancing risk of\nsecured financing for\nless liquid assets, we\nhave established\nconcentration limits\nto diversify our\ninvestor base and\nreduce the amount of\nmonthly maturities for\nsecured financing of\nless liquid assets. As\na component of the\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework,\nwe hold a portion of\nour Liquidity\nResources against the\npotential disruption\nto our secured\nfinancing\ncapabilities.

Required ratios\nrepresent the\nregulatory minimum\nplus the capital\nbuffer requirement.\nRisk-Weighted Assets.\nRWA reflects both our\non- and off-balance\nsheet risk, as well as\ncapital charges\nattributable to the\nrisk of loss arising\nfrom the following: \u2022\nCredit risk: The\nfailure of a borrower,\ncounterparty or issuer\nto meet its financial\nobligations to us; \u2022\nMarket risk: Adverse\nchanges in the level\nof one or more market\nprices, rates,\nspreads, indices,\nvolatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity;\nand \u2022 Operational\nrisk: Inadequate or\nfailed processes or\nsystems, from human\nfactors or from\nexternal events ( e.g.\n, fraud, theft, legal\nand compliance risks,\ncyber attacks or\ndamage to physical\nassets). Our risk-\nbased capital ratios\nare computed under\neach of (i) the\nStandardized Approach\nand (ii) the Advanced\nApproach. The credit\nrisk RWA calculations\nbetween the two\napproaches differ in\nthat the Standardized\nApproach requires\ncalculation of RWA\nusing prescribed risk\nweights and exposure\nmethodologies, whereas\nthe Advanced Approach\nutilizes models to\ncalculate exposure\namounts and risk\nweights. At December\n31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, the\ndifferences between\nthe actual and\nrequired ratios were\nlower under the\nStandardized Approach.\nLeverage-Based\nRegulatory Capital.\nLeverage-based capital\nrequirements include a\nminimum Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 4%,\na minimum SLR of 3%\nand an enhanced SLR\ncapital buffer of at\nleast 2%. CECL\nDeferral. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, our\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\namounts and ratios, as\nwell as RWA, adjusted\naverage assets and\nsupplementary leverage\nexposure were\ncalculated excluding\nthe effect of the\nadoption of CECL based\non the Firm\u2019s election\nto defer this effect\nover a five-year\ntransition period that\nbegan on January 1,\n2020. In 2022 t he\ndeferral impacts began\nto phase in at 25% per\nyear and will become\nfully phased-in\nbeginning in 2025.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nRatios\n                                              \n

These\nrequirements are\ndesigned to ensure\nthat covered BHCs will\nhave enough loss-\nabsorbing resources at\nthe point of failure\nto be recapitalized\nthrough the conversion\nof eligible LTD to\nequity or otherwise by\nimposing losses on\neligible LTD or other\nforms of TLAC where an\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy is used (see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand\nRegulation\u2014Financial\nHolding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and\nRecovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk\u201d).\nThese TLAC and\neligible LTD\nrequirements include\nvarious restrictions,\nsuch as requiring\neligible LTD to: be\nissued by the covered\nBHC; be unsecured;\nhave a maturity of one\nyear or more from the\ndate of issuance; and\nnot contain certain\nembedded features,\nsuch as a principal or\nredemption amount\nsubject to reduction\nbased on the\nperformance of an\nasset, entity or\nindex, or a similar\nfeature. In addition,\nthe requirements\nprovide permanent\ngrandfathering for\ndebt instruments\nissued prior to\nDecember 31, 2016 that\nwould be eligible LTD\nbut for having\nimpermissible\nacceleration clauses\nor being governed by\nforeign law. A covered\nBHC is also required\nto maintain minimum\nexternal TLAC equal to\nthe greater of (i) 18%\nof total RWA or (ii)\n7.5% of its total\nleverage exposure (the\ndenominator of its\nSLR). Covered BHCs\nmust also meet a\nminimum external LTD\nrequirement equal to\nthe greater of (i)\ntotal RWA multiplied\nby the sum of 6% plus\nthe higher of the\nMethod 1 or Method 2\nG-SIB capital\nsurcharge applicable\nto the Parent Company\nor (ii) 4.5% of its\ntotal leverage\nexposure. The final\nrule imposes TLAC\nbuffer requirements on\ntop of both the risk-\nbased and leverage\nexposure-based\nexternal TLAC minimum\nrequirements. The\nrisk-based TLAC buffer\nis equal to the sum of\n2.5%, our Method 1\nG-SIB surcharge and\nthe CCyB, if any, as a\npercentage of total\nRWA. The leverage\nexposure-based TLAC\nbuffer is equal to 2%\nof our total leverage\nexposure.

The SCB is the\ngreater of (i) the\nmaximum decline in our\nCommon Equity Tier 1\ncapital ratio under\nthe severely adverse\nscenario over the\nsupervisory stress\ntest measurement\nperiod plus the sum of\nthe four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends divided by\nthe projected RWAs\nfrom the quarter in\nwhich the Firm\u2019s\nprojected Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital\nratio reaches its\nminimum in the\nsupervisory stress\ntest and (ii) 2.5%.\nThe supervisory stress\ntest assumes that BHCs\ngenerally maintain a\nconstant level of\nassets and RWAs\nthroughout the\nprojection period. A\nfirm\u2019s SCB is subject\nto revision each year,\ntaking effect from\nOctober 1 to reflect\nthe results of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test. The\nFederal Reserve has\ndiscretion to\nrecalculate a firm\u2019s\nSCB outside of the\nOctober 1 annual cycle\nand to require\napproval for certain\nactions, in some\ncircumstances. The\nFederal Reserve also\nhas the authority to\nimpose restrictions on\ncapital actions as a\nsupervisory matter.\nFor the 2022 capital\nplanning and stress\ntest cycle, we\nsubmitted our capital\nplan and company-run\nstress test results to\nthe Federal Reserve on\nApril 5, 2022. On June\n23, 2022, the Federal\nReserve published\nsummary results of its\nsupervisory stress\ntests of each large\nBHC, in which the\nprojected decline in\nour Common Equity Tier\n1 ratio in the\nseverely adverse\nscenario improved from\nthe prior annual\nsupervisory stress\ntest, from 4.7% to\n4.6%. Following the\npublication of the\nsupervisory stress\ntest results, and as a\nresult of the increase\nin our common stock\ndividend and the\nresulting dividend\nadd-on, we announced\nthat our SCB will be\n5.8% from October 1,\n2022 through September\n30, 2023. Together\nwith other features of\nthe regulatory capital\nframework, this SCB\nresults in an\naggregate Standardized\nApproach Common Equity\nTier 1 ratio of 13.3%.\nWe also disclosed a\nsummary of the results\nof our company-run\nstress tests on our\nInvestor Relations\nwebsite and increased\nour quarterly common\nstock dividend to\n$0.775 per share from\n$0.70, beginning with\nthe common stock\ndividend announced on\nJuly 14, 2022.\nAdditionally, our\nBoard of Directors\napproved a new multi-\nyear repurchase\nauthorization of up to\n$20 billion of\noutstanding common\nstock, without a set\nexpiration date,\nbeginning in the third\nquarter of 2022,\n\nwhich will be\nexercised from time to\ntime as conditions\nwarrant. Attribution\nof Average Common\nEquity According to\nthe Required Capital\nFramework Our required\ncapital (\u201cRequired\nCapital\u201d) estimation\nis based on the\nRequired Capital\nframework, an internal\ncapital adequacy\nmeasure. Common equity\nattribution to the\nbusiness segments is\nbased on capital usage\ncalculated under the\nRequired Capital\nframework, as well as\neach business\nsegment\u2019s relative\ncontribution to our\ntotal Required\nCapital. The Required\nCapital framework is a\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nmeasure, which is\ncompared with our\nregulatory capital to\nensure that we\nmaintain an amount of\ngoing concern capital\nafter absorbing\npotential losses from\nstress events, where\napplicable, at a point\nin time. The amount of\ncapital allocated to\nthe business segments\nis generally set at\nthe beginning of each\nyear and remains fixed\nthroughout the year\nuntil the next annual\nreset unless a\nsignificant business\nchange occurs ( e.g. ,\nacquisition or\ndisposition).

In\nline with our SPOE\nstrategy, the Parent\nCompany has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to its\nwholly owned, direct\nsubsidiary Morgan\nStanley Holdings LLC\n(the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d).\nIn addition, the\nParent Company has\nentered into an\namended and restated\nsupport agreement with\nits material entities\n(including the Funding\nIHC) and certain other\nsubsidiaries. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\ncontributable assets\nto our supported\nentities and/or the\nFunding IHC. The\nFunding IHC would be\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our\nsupported entities.\nThe combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the\nrequirement to\nmaintain certain\nlevels of TLAC is that\nlosses in resolution\nwould be imposed on\nthe holders of\neligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\ncreditors of our\nsupported entities and\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and the\nFunding IHC under the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement are\nin most cases secured\non a senior basis by\nthe assets of the\nParent Company (other\nthan shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets)\nand the assets of the\nFunding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our\nsupported entities,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, with respect to\nthe secured assets,\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n\nFor more information\nabout resolution and\nrecovery planning\nrequirements and our\nactivities in these\nareas, including the\nimplications of such\nactivities in a\nresolution scenario,\nsee\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand\nRegulation\u2014Financial\nHolding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and\nRecovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk.\u201d\n                                              \n  Regulatory Developments and Other Matters   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Covered Fund Restrictions under the         \n  Volcker Rule                                \n                                              \nThe Volcker Rule\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule. During the\ncurrent quarter, we\nhave continued our\nassessment of\nconformance options\npermitted under the\nVolcker Rule with\nrespect to certain\nlegacy illiquid funds\nfor which we\npreviously received a\nconformance extension\nuntil July 21, 2023.\nThese conformance\noptions include, but\nare not limited to,\nrestructuring our\ninvestments, selling a\nportion or all of our\ninterests in certain\nlegacy illiquid funds\nand relying on other\napplicable exemptions\nand exclusions under\nthe Volcker Rule.\n\nAs of December 31,\n2022, the carrying\nvalue of our\ninvestments in those\nlegacy illiquid funds\napproximated $230\nmillion.\n\nReplacement of London\nInterbank Offered Rate\nand Replacement or\nReform of Other\nInterest Rate\nBenchmarks\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave sponsored\ninitiatives in recent\nyears to replace LIBOR\nand replace or reform\ncertain other interest\nrate benchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from use of the\nIBORs to alternative\nrates and other\npotential interest\nrate benchmark reforms\nis underway and is a\nmulti-year initiative.\n\nThe publication of\nmost non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR rates ceased as\nof the end of December\n2021, although certain\nSterling and Yen LIBOR\nrates have been\npublished for a\nlimited period\nfollowing this date on\nthe basis of a\n\u201csynthetic\u201d\nmethodology (known as\n\u201csynthetic LIBOR\u201d).\nThe synthetic Yen\nLIBOR rates ceased as\nof the end of December\n2022 and the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cUK FCA\u201d),\nwhich regulates the\npublisher of LIBOR\n(ICE Benchmark\nAdministration), has\nannounced that\npublication of the\none- and six-month\ntenors of synthetic\nSterling LIBOR will\ncease at the end of\nMarch 2023 and the\nthree-month synthetic\nSterling LIBOR at the\nend of March 2024.\n\nU.S. dollar LIBOR\nrates are expected to\ncease being published\nas of the end of June\n2023. On March 15,\n2022 the U.S. enacted\nfederal legislation\nthat is intended to\nminimize legal and\neconomic uncertainty\nfollowing U.S. dollar\nLIBOR\u2019s cessation by\nreplacing LIBOR\nreferences in certain\nU.S. law-governed\ncontracts under\ncertain circumstances\nwith a SOFR-based rate\nidentified in a\nFederal Reserve rule\nplus a statutory\nspread adjustment.\nWhile some states have\nalready adopted LIBOR\nlegislation, the\nfederal legislation\nexpressly preempts any\nprovision of any state\nor local law, statute,\nrule, regulation or\nstandard. In addition,\nthe UK FCA is\nconsidering the\ncontinued publication\nof the one-, three-\nand six-month tenors\nof U.S. dollar LIBOR\non a synthetic basis\nuntil the end of\nSeptember 2024. This\nmay result in certain\nnon-U.S. law-governed\ncontracts and U.S.\nlaw-governed contracts\nnot covered by the\nfederal legislation to\nremain on synthetic\nU.S. dollar LIBOR\nuntil the end of this\nperiod.\n\nAs of December 31,\n2022, our LIBOR-\nreferenced contracts\nwere primarily\nconcentrated in\nderivative contracts\nand, to a lesser\nextent, loans,\nfloating rate notes,\npreferred shares,\nsecuritizations and\nmortgages. A\nsignificant majority\nof our derivative\ncontracts, and a\nmajority of our non-\nderivative contracts,\ncontain fallback\nprovisions or\notherwise have an\nexpected path that\nwill allow for the\ntransition to an\nalternative reference\nrate upon the\ncessation of the\napplicable LIBOR rate.\n\nWhile we have made\nsubstantial progress\nin the transition away\nfrom the IBORs, we\nnonetheless currently\nremain party to a\nsignificant number of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR-\nlinked\n                                 \n  51    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \ncontracts.

We\nbelieve effective risk\nmanagement is vital to\nthe success of our\nbusiness activities.\nAccordingly, we have\nan Enterprise Risk\nManagement (\u201cERM\u201d)\nframework to integrate\nthe diverse roles of\nrisk management into a\nholistic enterprise\nstructure and to\nfacilitate the\nincorporation of risk\nassessment into\ndecision-making\nprocesses across the\nFirm.\n\nWe have policies and\nprocedures in place to\nidentify, measure,\nmonitor, escalate,\nmitigate and control\nthe principal risks\ninvolved in the\nactivities of the\nInstitutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments, as\nwell as at the Parent\nCompany level. The\nprincipal risks\ninvolved in our\nbusiness activities\nare both financial and\nnon-financial and\ninclude market\n(including non-trading\nrisks), credit,\nliquidity, model,\noperational,\ncompliance,\ncybersecurity,\nstrategic,\nreputational and\nconduct risk.\nStrategic risk is\nintegrated into our\nbusiness planning,\nembedded in the\nevaluation of all\nprincipal risks and\noverseen by the Board.\n\nThe cornerstone of our\nrisk management\nphilosophy is the\npursuit of risk-\nadjusted returns\nthrough prudent risk\ntaking that protects\nour capital base and\nfranchise. This\nphilosophy is\nimplemented through\nthe ERM framework.\nFive key principles\nunderlie this\nphilosophy: integrity,\ncomprehensiveness,\nindependence,\naccountability and\ntransparency. To help\nensure the efficacy of\nrisk management, which\nis an essential\ncomponent of our\nreputation, senior\n\nmanagement requires\nthorough and frequent\nreporting and the\nappropriate escalation\nof risk matters. The\nfast-paced, complex\nand constantly\nevolving nature of\nglobal financial\nmarkets requires us to\nmaintain a risk\nmanagement culture\nthat is incisive,\nknowledgeable about\nspecialized products\nand markets, and\nsubject to ongoing\nreview and\nenhancement.\n\nOur risk appetite\ndefines the aggregate\nlevel and types of\nrisk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept to\nachieve its business\nobjectives, taking\ninto account the\ninterests of clients\nand fiduciary duties\nto shareholders, as\nwell as capital and\nother regulatory\nrequirements. This\nrisk appetite is\nembedded in our risk\nculture and linked to\nour short-term and\nlong-term strategic,\ncapital and financial\nplans, as well as\ncompensation programs.\nThis risk appetite and\nthe related Board-\nlevel risk limits and\nrisk tolerance\nstatements are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Risk Committee\nof the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d)\nand the Board on at\nleast an annual basis.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance Structure                   \n                                              \nRisk management at the\nFirm requires\nindependent Firm-level\noversight,\naccountability of our\nbusiness divisions,\nand effective\ncommunication of risk\nmatters across the\nFirm, to senior\nmanagement and\nultimately to the\nBoard.

We are\ncommitted to\nreinforcing and\nconfirming adherence\nto our core values\nthrough our governance\nframework, tone from\nthe top, management\noversight, risk\nmanagement and\ncontrols, and three\nlines of defense\nstructure (business,\ncontrol functions such\nas Risk Management and\nCompliance, and\nInternal Audit).\n\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\noverseeing the Firm\u2019s\npractices and\nprocedures relating to\nculture, values and\nconduct, as set forth\nin the Firm\u2019s\nCorporate Governance\nPolicies. Our Culture,\nValues and Conduct\nCommittee, along with\nthe Compliance and\nConduct Risk\nCommittee, are the\nsenior management\ncommittees that\noversee the Firmwide\nculture, values and\nconduct program and\nreport regularly to\nthe Board. A\nfundamental building\nblock of this program\nis the Firm\u2019s Code of\nConduct, which\nestablishes standards\nfor employee conduct\nthat further reinforce\nthe Firm\u2019s commitment\nto integrity and\nethical conduct. Every\nnew hire and every\nemployee annually is\nrequired to certify to\ntheir understanding of\nand adherence to the\nCode of Conduct. The\nFirm\u2019s Global Conduct\nRisk Management Policy\nalso sets out a\nconsistent global\nframework for managing\nConduct Risk ( i.e. ,\nthe risk arising from\nmisconduct by\nemployees or\ncontingent workers)\nand Conduct Risk\nincidents at the Firm.\n\nThe employee annual\nperformance review\nprocess includes\nevaluation of employee\nconduct related to\nrisk management\npractices and the\nFirm\u2019s expectations.\nWe also have several\nmutually reinforcing\nprocesses to identify\nemployee conduct that\nmay have an impact on\nemployment status,\ncurrent year\ncompensation and/or\nprior year\ncompensation. For\nexample, the Global\nIncentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy sets\nforth standards for\nmanagers when making\nannual compensation\ndecisions and\nspecifically provides\nthat managers must\nconsider whether their\nemployees effectively\nmanaged and/or\nsupervised risk\ncontrol practices\nduring the performance\nyear. Management\ncommittees from\ncontrol functions\nperiodically meet to\ndiscuss employees\nwhose conduct is not\nin line with our\nexpectations.

However,\nthe analyses used to\nassess such risks are\nnot predictions of\nfuture events, and\nactual results may\nvary significantly\nfrom such analyses due\nto events in the\nmarkets in which we\noperate and certain\nother factors\ndescribed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk refers to\nthe risk that a change\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, spreads,\nindices, volatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity,\nwill result in losses\nfor a position or\nportfolio. Generally,\nwe incur market risk\nas a result of\ntrading, investing and\nclient facilitation\nactivities,\nprincipally within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment where the\nsubstantial majority\nof our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is\ngenerated. In\naddition, we incur\nnon-trading market\nrisk, principally\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments. The\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\n(including interest\n\nrate risk) from\nlending and deposit-\ntaking activities. The\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\nfrom capital\ninvestments in its\nfunds.\n\nMarket risk also\nincludes non-trading\ninterest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest\nrate risk in the\nbanking book (amounts\nclassified for\nregulatory capital\npurposes under the\nbanking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure\nthat a change in\ninterest rates will\nresult in prospective\nearnings changes for\nassets and liabilities\nin the banking book.\n\nSound market risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nculture. The various\nbusiness units and\ntrading desks are\nresponsible for\nensuring that market\nrisk exposures are\nwell-managed and\nprudent. The control\ngroups help ensure\nthat these risks are\nmeasured and closely\nmonitored and are made\ntransparent to senior\nmanagement. The Market\nRisk Department is\nresponsible for\nensuring the\ntransparency of\nmaterial market risks,\nmonitoring compliance\nwith established\nlimits and escalating\nrisk concentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nMarket Risk Department\nmonitors our risk\nagainst limits on\naggregate risk\nexposures, performs a\nvariety of risk\nanalyses, routinely\nreports risk\nsummaries, and\nmaintains our VaR and\nscenario analysis\nsystems. Market risk\nis also monitored\nthrough various\nmeasures: by use of\nstatistics (including\nVaR and related\nanalytical measures);\nby measures of\nposition size and\nsensitivity; and\nthrough routine stress\ntesting, which\nmeasures the impact on\nthe value of existing\nportfolios of\nspecified changes in\nmarket factors and\nscenarios designed by\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment in\ncollaboration with the\nbusiness units. The\nmaterial risks\nidentified by these\nprocesses are\nsummarized in reports\nproduced by the Market\nRisk Department that\nare circulated to and\ndiscussed with senior\nmanagement, the FRC,\nthe BRC and the Board.\n                                              \n  Trading Risks                               \n                                              \n                                              \n   Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market   \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nWe have exposures to a\nwide range of risks\nrelated to interest\nrates and credit\nspreads, equity\nprices, foreign\nexchange rates and\ncommodity prices as\nwell as the associated\nimplied volatilities,\ncorrelations and\nspreads of the global\nmarkets in which we\nconduct our trading\nactivities.\n\nWe are exposed to\ninterest rate and\ncredit spread risk as\na result of our\nmarket-making\nactivities and other\ntrading in interest\nrate-sensitive\nfinancial instruments\n(i.e., risk arising\nfrom changes in the\nlevel or implied\nvolatility of interest\nrates, the timing of\nmortgage prepayments,\nthe shape of the yield\ncurve and/or credit\nspreads).

Commodity\nexposures are subject\nto periods of high\nprice volatility as a\nresult of changes in\nsupply and demand.\nThese changes can be\ncaused by weather\nconditions; physical\nproduction and\ntransportation; or\ngeopolitical and other\nevents that affect the\navailable supply and\nlevel of demand for\nthese commodities.\n\nWe manage our trading\npositions by employing\na variety of risk\nmitigation strategies.\nThese strategies\ninclude\ndiversification of\nrisk exposures and\nhedging. Hedging\nactivities consist of\nthe purchase or sale\nof positions in\nrelated securities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).

The Market\nRisk Department\ncalculates and\ndistributes daily VaR-\nbased risk measures to\nvarious levels of\nmanagement.\n\nWe estimate VaR using\na model based on a\none-year equal\nweighted historical\nsimulation for general\nmarket risk factors\nand name-specific risk\nin corporate equities\nand related\nderivatives, and Monte\nCarlo simulation for\nname-specific risk in\nbonds, loans and\nrelated derivatives.\nThe model constructs a\ndistribution of\nhypothetical daily\nchanges in the value\nof trading portfolios\nbased on historical\nobservation of daily\nchanges in key market\nindices or other\nmarket risk factors,\nand information on the\nsensitivity of the\nportfolio values to\nthese market risk\nfactor changes.\n\nVaR for risk\nmanagement purposes\n(\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95%\nlevel of confidence\nover a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a\nuseful indicator of\npossible trading\nlosses resulting from\nadverse daily market\nmoves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the\nunrealized loss in\nportfolio value that,\nbased on historically\nobserved market risk\nfactor movements,\nwould have been\nexceeded with a\nfrequency of 5%, or\nfive times in every\n100 trading days, if\nthe portfolio were\nheld constant for one\nday.\n\nOur VaR model\ngenerally takes into\naccount linear and\nnon-linear exposures\nto equity and\ncommodity price risk,\ninterest rate risk,\ncredit spread risk and\nforeign exchange\nrates. The model also\ntakes into account\nlinear exposures to\nimplied volatility\nrisks for all asset\nclasses and non-linear\nexposures to implied\nvolatility risks for\nequity, commodity and\nforeign exchange\nreferenced products.\nThe VaR model also\ncaptures certain\nimplied correlation\nrisks associated with\nportfolio credit\nderivatives, as well\nas certain basis risks\n(e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit\nderivatives).\n\nWe use VaR as one of a\nrange of risk\nmanagement tools.\nAmong their benefits,\nVaR models permit\nestimation of a\nportfolio\u2019s aggregate\nmarket risk exposure,\nincorporating a range\nof varied market risks\nand portfolio assets.\nOne key element of the\nVaR model is that it\nreflects risk\nreduction due to\nportfolio\ndiversification or\nhedging activities.\nHowever, VaR has\nvarious limitations,\nwhich include, but are\nnot limited to: use of\nhistorical changes in\nmarket risk factors,\nwhich may not be\naccurate predictors of\nfuture market\nconditions and may not\nfully incorporate the\nrisk of extreme market\nevents that are\noutsized relative to\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior or\nreflect the historical\ndistribution of\nresults beyond the 95%\nconfidence interval;\nand reporting of\nlosses in a single\nday, which does not\nreflect the risk of\npositions that cannot\nbe liquidated or\nhedged in one day. A\nsmall proportion of\nmarket risk generated\nby trading positions\nis not included in\nVaR.\n                                 \n  57    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nThe modeling of the\nrisk characteristics\nof some positions\nrelies on\napproximations that,\nunder certain\ncircumstances, could\nproduce significantly\ndifferent results from\nthose produced using\nmore precise measures.\nVaR is most\nappropriate as a risk\nmeasure for trading\npositions in liquid\nfinancial markets and\nwill understate the\nrisk associated with\nsevere events, such as\nperiods of extreme\nilliquidity. We are\naware of these and\nother limitations and,\ntherefore, use VaR as\nonly one component in\nour risk management\noversight process.\nThis process also\nincorporates stress\ntesting and scenario\nanalyses and extensive\nrisk monitoring,\nanalysis and control\nat the trading desk,\ndivision and Firm\nlevels. We update our\nVaR model in response\nto changes in the\ncomposition of trading\nportfolios and to\nimprovements in\nmodeling techniques\nand systems\ncapabilities. We are\ncommitted to\ncontinuous review and\nenhancement of VaR\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in order\nto capture evolving\nrisks associated with\nchanges in market\nstructure and\ndynamics. As part of\nour regular process\nimprovements,\nadditional systematic\nand name-specific risk\nfactors may be added\nto improve the VaR\nmodel\u2019s ability to\nmore accurately\nestimate risks to\nspecific asset classes\nor industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR\nstatistics are\nestimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR\nshould not be viewed\nas predictive of our\nfuture revenues or\nfinancial performance\nor of our ability to\nmonitor and manage\nrisk. There can be no\nassurance that our\nactual losses on a\nparticular day will\nnot exceed the VaR\namounts indicated in\nthe following tables\nor that such losses\nwill not occur more\nthan five times in 100\ntrading days for a\n95%/one-day VaR. VaR\ndoes not predict the\nmagnitude of losses\nthat, should they\noccur, may be\nsignificantly greater\nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not\nreadily comparable\nacross firms because\nof differences in the\nfirms\u2019 portfolios,\nmodeling assumptions\nand methodologies.\nThese differences can\nresult in materially\ndifferent VaR\nestimates across firms\nfor similar\nportfolios. The impact\nof such differences\nvaries depending on\nthe factor history\nassumptions, the\nfrequency with which\nthe factor history is\nupdated and the\nconfidence level. As a\nresult, VaR statistics\nare more useful when\ninterpreted as\nindicators of trends\nin a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile rather than as\nan absolute measure of\nrisk to be compared\nacross firms. Our\nregulators have\napproved the same VaR\nmodel we use for risk\nmanagement purposes\nfor use in regulatory\ncalculations. The\nportfolio of positions\nused for Management\nVaR differs from that\nused for Regulatory\nVaR.

Net interest\nincome in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment primarily\nconsists of interest\nincome earned on non-\ntrading assets held,\nincluding loans and\ninvestment securities,\nas well as margin and\nother lending on non-\nbank entities and\ninterest expense\nincurred on non-\ntrading liabilities,\nprimarily deposits.\nWealth Management Net\nInterest Income\nSensitivity Analysis 1\n                                              \n                          At              At  \n                    December        December  \n  $ in                   31,             31,  \n  millions              2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Basis                                       \n  point                                       \n  change                                      \n  +100         $         643    $      1,648  \n  -100                  -745          -1,023  \n                                              \n1.

The market risk related to these\ninvestments is measured by estimating the\npotential reduction in net revenues associated\nwith a reasonably possible 10% decline in\ninvestment values and rel ated impact on\nperformance-based income, as applicable.\nInvestments sensitivity changed between\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 with\nan increase in sensitivity in Other Firm\ninvestments primarily due to new investments\nin Community Reinvestment Act affordable\nhousing, as well as lower sensitivity in MUMSS\ndriven by Yen depreciation. Asset Management\nRevenue Sensitivity Certain asset management\nrevenues in the Wealth Management and\nInvestment Management business segments are\nderived from management fees, which are based\non fee-based client assets in Wealth\nManagement or AUM in Investment Management\n(together, \u201cclient holdings\u201d). The assets\nunderlying client holdings are primarily\ncomposed of equity, fixed income and\nalternative investments and are sensitive to\nchanges in related markets. These revenues\ndepend on multiple factors including, but not\nlimited to, the level and duration of a market\nincrease or decline, price volatility, the\ngeographic and industry mix of client assets,\nand client behavior such as the rate and\nmagnitude of client investments and\nredemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may\nnot correlate completely with changes in the\nrelated markets. Credit Risk Credit risk\nrefers to the risk of loss arising when a\nborrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet\nits financial obligations to us. We are\nprimarily exposed to credit risk from\ninstitutions and individuals through our\nInstitutional Securities and Wealth Management\nbusiness segments. We incur credit risk in our\nInstitutional Securities business segment\nthrough a variety of activities, including,\nbut not limited to, the following:\n\n\u2022 extending credit to clients through loans\nand lending commitments; \u2022 entering into swap\nor other derivative contracts under which\ncounterparties may have obligations to make\npayments to us; \u2022 providing short- or long-\nterm funding that is secured by physical or\nfinancial collateral whose value may at times\nbe insufficient to fully cover the repayment\namount; \u2022 posting margin and/or collateral to\nclearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges,\nbanks, securities firms and other financial\ncounterparties; \u2022 placing funds on deposit at\nother financial institutions to support our\nclearing and settlement obligations; and \u2022\ninvesting or trading in securities and loan\npools, whereby the value of these assets may\nfluctuate based on realized or expected\ndefaults on the underlying obligations or\nloans. We incur credit risk in our Wealth\nManagement business segment, primarily through\nlending to individuals and entities,\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 margin loans collateralized by securities; \u2022\nsecurities-based lending and other forms of\nsecured loans, including tailored lending to\nhigh and ultra-high net worth clients; \u2022\nsingle-family residential mortgage loans in\nconforming, non-conforming or HELOC form\nprimarily to existing Wealth Management\nclients; and \u2022 employee loans granted\nprimarily to recruit certain Wealth Management\nrepresentatives. Monitoring and Control The\nCredit Risk Management Department (\u201cCRM\u201d)\nestablishes Firmwide practices to evaluate,\nmonitor and control credit risk at the\ntransaction, obligor and portfolio levels. The\nCRM approves extensions of credit, evaluates\nthe creditworthiness of the counterparties and\nborrowers on a regular basis, and helps ensure\nthat credit exposure is actively monitored and\nmanaged. The evaluation of counterparties and\nborrowers includes an assessment of the\nprobability that an obligor will default on\nits financial obligations and any losses that\nmay occur when an obligor defaults. In\naddition, credit risk exposure is actively\nmanaged by credit professionals and committees\nwithin the CRM and through various risk\ncommittees, whose membership includes\nindividuals from the CRM. A comprehensive and\nglobal Credit Limits Framework is utilized to\nmanage credit risk levels across the Firm. The\nCredit Limits Framework is calibrated within\nour risk tolerance and includes single-name\nlimits and portfolio concentration limits by\ncountry, industry and product type. The CRM\nhelps ensure timely and transparent\ncommunication of material credit risks,\ncompliance with established limits and\nescalation of risk concentrations to\nappropriate senior management. The CRM also\nworks closely with the Market Risk Department\nand applicable business units to monitor risk\nexposures and to perform stress tests to\nidentify, analyze and control credit risk\nconcentrations arising from lending and\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    60  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \ntrading activities.\nThe stress tests shock\nmarket factors ( e.g.\n, interest rates,\ncommodity prices,\ncredit spreads), risk\nparameters ( e.g.,\nprobability of default\nand loss given\ndefault), recovery\nrates and expected\nlosses in order to\nassess the impact of\nstresses on exposures,\nprofit and loss, and\nour capital position.\nStress tests are\nconducted in\naccordance with our\nestablished policies\nand procedures. Credit\nEvaluation The\nevaluation of\ncorporate and\ninstitutional\ncounterparties and\nborrowers includes\nassigning credit\nratings, which reflect\nan assessment of an\nobligor\u2019s probability\nof default and loss\ngiven default. Credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the assessment\nof financial\nstatements; leverage;\nliquidity; capital\nstrength; asset\ncomposition and\nquality; market\ncapitalization; access\nto capital markets;\nadequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable; and, in\nthe case of certain\nloans, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements.\nThe CRM also evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, management\nand other factors such\nas country risks and\nlegal and contingent\nrisks that could\naffect the obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile.\nAdditionally, the CRM\nevaluates the relative\nposition of our\nexposure in the\nborrower\u2019s capital\nstructure and relative\nrecovery prospects, as\nwell as other\nstructural elements of\nthe particular\ntransaction. The\nevaluation of consumer\nborrowers is tailored\nto the specific type\nof lending.\nSecurities-based loans\nare evaluated based on\nfactors that include,\nbut are not limited\nto, the amount of the\nloan and the amount,\nquality,\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. The\nunderwriting of\nresidential real\nestate loans includes,\nbut is not limited to,\nreview of the\nobligor\u2019s debt-to-\nincome ratio, net\nworth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand industry standard\ncredit scoring models\n( e.g. , FICO scores).\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nindividual loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level, and\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis. Credit\nrisk metrics assigned\nto our borrowers\nduring the evaluation\nprocess are\nincorporated into the\nCRM maintenance of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Such allowance\nserves as a reserve\nfor probable inherent\nlosses, as well as\nprobable losses\nrelated to loans\nidentified as\nimpaired. For more\ninformation on the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, see Notes 2\nand 10 to the\nfinancial statements.\nRisk Mitigation We may\nseek to mitigate\ncredit risk from our\nlending and trading\nactivities in multiple\nways, including\ncollateral provisions,\nguarantees and hedges.\nAt the transaction\nlevel, we seek to\nmitigate risk through\nmanagement of key risk\nelements such as size,\ntenor, financial\ncovenants, seniority\nand collateral. We\nactively hedge our\nlending and\nderivatives exposures.\nHedging activities\nconsist of the\npurchase or sale of\npositions in related\nsecurities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\n\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).\nAdditionally, we may\nsell, assign or\nsyndicate loans and\nlending commitments to\nother financial\ninstitutions in the\nprimary and secondary\nloan markets. In\nconnection with our\nderivatives trading\nactivities, we\ngenerally enter into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral\narrangements with\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide us\nwith the ability to\ndemand collateral, as\nwell as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset\nreceivables and\npayables covered under\nthe same master\nagreement in the event\nof a counterparty\ndefault. A collateral\nmanagement group\nmonitors collateral\nlevels against\nrequirements and\noversees the\nadministration of the\ncollateral function.\nSee Note 9 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\ntransactions.

and\nResidential real\nestate loans.\nSecurities-based\nlending allows clients\nto borrow money\nagainst the value of\nqualifying securities,\ngenerally for any\npurpose other than\npurchasing, trading or\ncarrying securities or\nrefinancing margin\ndebt. We establish\napproved credit lines\nagainst qualifying\nsecurities and monitor\nlimits daily and,\npursuant to such\nguidelines, require\ncustomers to deposit\nadditional collateral,\nor reduce debt\npositions, when\nnecessary. These\ncredit lines are\nprimarily uncommitted\nloan facilities, as we\nreserve the right not\nto make any advances\nor may terminate these\ncredit lines at any\ntime. Factors\nconsidered in the\nreview of these loans\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the loan\namount, the client\u2019s\ncredit profile, the\ndegree of leverage,\ncollateral\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral.\nResidential real\nestate loans consist\nof first and second\nlien mortgages,\nincluding HELOCs. Our\nunderwriting policy is\ndesigned to ensure\nthat all borrowers\npass an assessment of\ncapacity and\nwillingness to pay,\nwhich includes an\nanalysis utilizing\nindustry standard\ncredit scoring models\n( e.g. , FICO scores),\ndebt-to-income ratios\nand assets of the\nborrower. LTV ratios\nare determined based\non independent third-\nparty property\nappraisals and\nvaluations, and\nsecurity lien\npositions are\nestablished through\ntitle and ownership\nreports. The vast\nmajority of mortgage\nloans, including\nHELOCs, are held for\ninvestment in the\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\u2019s\nloan portfolio.\n\nWealth Management\nAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u2014Loans and\nLending Commitments\n                                          \n  $ in millions                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  ACL\u2014Loans                       $  111  \n  ACL\u2014Lending commitments             18  \n  Total at December 31, 2021         129  \n  Gross charge-offs                  -14  \n  Recoveries                           1  \n  Net (charge-offs) recoveries       -13  \n  Provision for credit losses         69  \n  Total at December 31, 2022      $  185  \n  ACL\u2014Loans                       $  165  \n  ACL\u2014Lending commitments             20  \n                                          \nAt December 31, 2022,\nmore than 75% of\nWealth Management\nresidential real\nestate loans were to\nborrowers with\n\u201cExceptional\u201d or \u201cVery\nGood\u201d FICO scores (\ni.e. , exceeding 740).\nAdditionally, Wealth\nManagement\u2019s\nsecurities-based\nlending portfolio\nremains well-\ncollateralized and\nsubject to daily\nclient margining,\nwhich includes\nrequiring customers to\ndeposit additional\ncollateral or reduce\ndebt positions, when\nnecessary.

Amounts may\nfluctuate from period\nto period as overall\nclient balances change\nas a result of market\nlevels, client\npositioning and\nleverage. Credit\nexposures arising from\nmargin lending\nactivities are\ngenerally mitigated by\ntheir short-term\nnature, the value of\ncollateral held and\nour right to call for\nadditional margin when\ncollateral values\ndecline. However, we\ncould incur losses in\nthe event that the\ncustomer fails to meet\nmargin calls and\ncollateral values\ndecline below the loan\namount.

Counterparty credit ratings are determined\ninternally by the CRM. We are exposed to\ncredit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives.\nCredit risk with respect to derivative\ninstruments arises from the possibility that a\ncounterparty may fail to perform according to\nthe terms of the contract. For a description\nof our risk mitigation strategies, see \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Risk Mitigation\u201d herein. Credit\nDerivatives A credit derivative is a contract\nbetween a seller and buyer of protection\nagainst the risk of a credit event occurring\non one\n\nor more debt obligations issued by a specified\nreference entity. The buyer typically pays a\nperiodic premium over the life of the contract\nand is protected for the period. If a credit\nevent occurs, the seller is required to make\npayment to the beneficiary based on the terms\nof the credit derivative contract. Credit\nevents, as defined in the contract, may be one\nor more of the following defined events:\nbankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the\nreferenced entity, failure to pay, obligation\nacceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium\nand restructuring. We trade in a variety of\ncredit derivatives and may either purchase or\nwrite protection on a single name or portfolio\nof referenced entities. In transactions\nreferencing a portfolio of entities or\nsecurities, protection may be limited to a\ntranche of exposure or a single name within\nthe portfolio. We are an active market maker\nin the credit derivatives markets. As a market\nmaker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on\nclient flow business and manage any residual\ncredit or correlation risk on a portfolio\nbasis. Further, we use credit derivatives to\nmanage our exposure to residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and corporate\nlending exposures. The effectiveness of our\nCDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may\nvary depending upon a number of factors,\nincluding the contractual terms of the CDS. We\nactively monitor our counterparty credit risk\nrelated to credit derivatives. A majority of\nour counterparties are composed of banks,\nbroker-dealers, insurance and other financial\ninstitutions. Contracts with these\ncounterparties may include provisions related\nto counterparty rating downgrades, which may\nresult in the counterparty posting additional\ncollateral to us. As with all derivative\ncontracts, we consider counterparty credit\nrisk in the valuation of our positions and\nrecognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading\nrevenues in the income statement. For\nadditional credit exposure information on our\ncredit derivative portfolio, see Note 7 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    66  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nCountry Risk Country\nrisk exposure is the\nrisk that events in,\nor that affect, a\nforeign country (any\ncountry other than the\nU.S.) might adversely\naffect us. We actively\nmanage country risk\nexposure through a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement framework\nthat combines credit\nand other market\nfundamentals and\nallows us to\neffectively identify,\nmonitor and limit\ncountry risk. Our\nobligor credit\nevaluation process may\nalso identify indirect\nexposures, whereby an\nobligor has\nvulnerability or\nexposure to another\ncountry or\njurisdiction. Examples\nof indirect exposures\ninclude mutual funds\nthat invest in a\nsingle country,\noffshore companies\nwhose assets reside in\nanother country to\nthat of the offshore\njurisdiction and\nfinance company\nsubsidiaries of\ncorporations. Indirect\nexposures identified\nthrough the credit\nevaluation process may\nresult in a\nreclassification of\ncountry risk. We\nconduct periodic\nstress testing that\nseeks to measure the\nimpact on our credit\nand market exposures\nof shocks stemming\nfrom negative economic\nor political\nscenarios. When deemed\nappropriate by our\nrisk managers, the\nstress test scenarios\ninclude possible\ncontagion effects and\nsecond order risks.\nThis analysis, and\nresults of the stress\ntests, may result in\nthe amendment of\nlimits or exposure\nmitigation. Our\nsovereign exposures\nconsist of financial\ncontracts and\nobligations entered\ninto with sovereign\nand local governments.\nOur non-sovereign\nexposures consist of\nfinancial contracts\nand obligations\nentered into primarily\nwith corporations and\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Index\ncredit derivatives are\nincluded in the\nfollowing country risk\nexposure table. Each\nreference entity\nwithin an index is\nallocated to that\nreference entity\u2019s\ncountry of risk. Index\nexposures are\nallocated to the\nunderlying reference\nentities in proportion\nto the notional\nweighting of each\nreference entity in\nthe index, adjusted\nfor any fair value\nreceivable or payable\nfor that reference\nentity. Where credit\nrisk crosses multiple\njurisdictions, for\nexample, a CDS\npurchased from an\nissuer in a specific\ncountry that\nreferences bonds\nissued by an entity in\na different country,\nthe fair value of the\nCDS is reflected in\nthe Net Counterparty\nExposure row based on\nthe country of the CDS\nissuer. Further, the\nnotional amount of the\nCDS adjusted for the\nfair value of the\nreceivable or payable\nis reflected in the\nNet Inventory row\nbased on the country\nof the underlying\nreference entity.\n\nTop 10 Non-U.S.\nCountry Exposures at\nDecember 31, 2022\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       F\u2026       \u2026       B\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n         2       \u2026       10       \u2026        \u2014  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -6       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  63  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2014       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       7\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  7\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       S\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       71       \u2014       52  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014       -8  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       8\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       9\u2026       \u2014       8\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2014       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n1.

We may incur\noperational risk\nacross the full scope\nof our business\nactivities, including\nrevenue-generating\nactivities and support\nand control groups (\ne.g. , information\ntechnology and trade\nprocessing).\n\nWe have established an\noperational risk\nframework to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and\ncontrol risk across\nthe Firm. Effective\noperational risk\nmanagement is\nessential to reducing\nthe impact of\noperational risk\nincidents and\nmitigating legal,\nregulatory and\nreputational risks.\nThe framework is\ncontinually evolving\nto account for changes\nin the Firm and to\nrespond to the\nchanging regulatory\nand business\nenvironment.\n\nWe have implemented\noperational risk data\nand assessment systems\nto monitor and analyze\ninternal and external\noperational risk\nevents, to assess\nbusiness environment\nand internal control\nfactors, and to\nperform scenario\nanalysis. The\ncollected data\nelements are\nincorporated in the\noperational risk\ncapital model. The\nmodel encompasses both\nquantitative and\nqualitative elements.\nInternal loss data and\nscenario analysis\nresults are direct\ninputs to the capital\nmodel, while external\noperational incidents,\nbusiness environment\nand internal control\nfactors are evaluated\nas part of the\nscenario analysis\nprocess.\n\nIn addition, we employ\na variety of risk\nprocesses and\nmitigants to manage\nour operational risk\nexposures. These\ninclude a governance\nframework, a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement program and\ninsurance. Operational\nrisks and associated\nrisk exposures are\nassessed relative to\nthe risk appetite\nreviewed and confirmed\nby the Board and are\nprioritized\naccordingly.\n\nThe breadth and range\nof operational risk\nare such that the\ntypes of mitigating\nactivities are wide-\nranging. Examples of\nactivities include:\ncontinuous enhancement\nof defenses against\ncyber attacks; use of\nlegal agreements and\ncontracts to transfer\nand/or limit\noperational risk\nexposures; due\ndiligence;\nimplementation of\nenhanced policies and\nprocedures; technology\nchange management\ncontrols; exception\nmanagement processing\ncontrols; and\nsegregation of duties.\n\nPrimary responsibility\nfor the management of\noperational risk is\nwith the business\nsegments, the control\ngroups and the\nbusiness managers\ntherein. The business\nmanagers maintain\nprocesses and controls\ndesigned to identify,\nassess, manage,\nmitigate and report\noperational risk. Each\nof the business\nsegments has a\ndesignated operational\nrisk coordinator. The\noperational risk\ncoordinator regularly\nreviews operational\nrisk issues and\nreports to our senior\nmanagement within each\nbusiness. Each control\ngroup also has a\ndesignated operational\n\nrisk coordinator and a\nforum for discussing\noperational risk\nmatters with our\nsenior management.\nOversight of\noperational risk is\nprovided by the\nOperational Risk\nOversight Committee,\nlegal entity risk\ncommittees, regional\nrisk committees and\nsenior management. In\nthe event of a merger;\njoint venture;\ndivestiture;\nreorganization; or\ncreation of a new\nlegal entity, a new\nproduct, or a business\nactivity, operational\nrisks are considered,\nand any necessary\nchanges in processes\nor controls are\nimplemented.\n\nThe Operational Risk\nDepartment (\u201cORD\u201d)\nprovides independent\noversight of\noperational risk and\nassesses, measures and\nmonitors operational\nrisk against appetite.\nThe ORD works with the\ndivisions and control\ngroups to embed a\ntransparent,\nconsistent and\ncomprehensive\nframework for managing\noperational risk\nwithin each area and\nacross the Firm.\n\nThe ORD scope includes\noversight of\ntechnology risk,\ncybersecurity risk,\ninformation security\nrisk, the fraud risk\nmanagement and\nprevention program,\nand third-party risk\nmanagement (supplier\nand affiliate risk\noversight and\nassessment), among\nothers.\n                                              \n  Cybersecurity                               \n                                              \nOur cybersecurity and\ninformation security\npolicies, procedures\nand technologies are\ndesigned to protect\nour own, our client\nand our employee data\nagainst unauthorized\ndisclosure,\nmodification or misuse\nand are also designed\nto address regulatory\nrequirements.

Liquidity risk\n\nalso encompasses our\nability (or perceived\nability) to meet our\nfinancial obligations\nwithout experiencing\nsignificant business\ndisruption or\nreputational damage\nthat may threaten our\nviability as a going\nconcern. Liquidity\nrisk also encompasses\nthe associated funding\nrisks triggered by the\nmarket or\nidiosyncratic stress\nevents that may\nnegatively affect our\nliquidity and may\nimpact our ability to\nraise new funding.\nGenerally, we incur\nliquidity and funding\nrisk as a result of\nour trading, lending,\ninvesting and client\nfacilitation\nactivities.\n\nOur Liquidity Risk\nManagement Framework\nis critical to helping\nensure that we\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity reserves and\ndurable funding\nsources to meet our\ndaily obligations and\nto withstand\nunanticipated stress\nevents. The Liquidity\nRisk Department is a\ndistinct area in Risk\nManagement responsible\nfor the oversight and\nmonitoring of\nliquidity risk.

Those\nstandards require that\nwe plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance\nabout whether the\nfinancial statements\nare free of material\nmisstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud.\nOur audits included\nperforming procedures\nto assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement\nof the financial\nstatements, whether\ndue to error or fraud,\nand performing\nprocedures that\nrespond to those\nrisks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on\na test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the\nfinancial statements.\nOur audits also\nincluded evaluating\nthe accounting\nprinciples used and\nsignificant estimates\nmade by management, as\nwell as evaluating the\noverall presentation\nof the financial\nstatements.

These\nfinancial instruments\ncan span a broad array\nof product types and\ngenerally include\nderivative, security,\nloan, and borrowing\npositions. As\ndescribed in Note 5,\nthese Level 3\nfinancial instruments\napproximate $10.1\nbillion and $6.1\nbillion, respectively,\nof financial assets\nand liabilities\ncarried at fair value\non a recurring basis\nat December 31, 2022.\nUnlike financial\ninstruments whose\ninputs are readily\nobservable and,\ntherefore, more easily\nindependently\ncorroborated, the\nvaluation of financial\ninstruments classified\nas Level 3 is\ninherently subjective\nand often involves the\nuse of unobservable\ninputs and proprietary\nvaluation models whose\nunderlying algorithms\nand valuation\nmethodologies are\ncomplex.\n\nWe identified the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis as a\ncritical audit matter\ngiven the Firm uses\ncomplex valuation\nmodels and/or model\ninputs that are not\nobservable in the\nmarketplace to\ndetermine the\nrespective fair\nvalues. Performing our\naudit procedures to\nevaluate the\nappropriateness of\nthese models and\ninputs involved a high\ndegree of auditor\njudgment,\nprofessionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, and an\nincreased extent of\ntesting.\n\nHow the Critical Audit\nMatter Was Addressed\nin the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures\nrelated to the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis\nincluded the\nfollowing, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 We tested the design\nand operating\neffectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrols that address\nfair value estimates,\nincluding model review\nand price\nverification. The Firm\nmaintains these\ninternal controls to\nassess the\nappropriateness of its\nvaluation\n                                 \n  71    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nmethodologies and the\nrelevant inputs and\nassumptions used to\ndetermine fair value\nestimates.\n\n\u2022 We independently\nevaluated the\nappropriateness of\nmanagement\u2019s\nsignificant valuation\nmethodologies,\nincluding the input\nassumptions,\nconsidering the\nexpected assumptions\nof other market\nparticipants and\nexternal data when\navailable.\n\n\u2022 We developed\nindependent fair value\nestimates for selected\nLevel 3 financial\ninstruments, using\nexternally sourced\ninputs and independent\nvaluation models, and\nused such estimates to\nfurther evaluate\nmanagement\u2019s fair\nvalue estimates. For\ncertain of our\nselected Level 3\nfinancial instruments,\nthis included a\ncomparison to the\nFirm\u2019s fair value\nestimates for similar\ntransactions and an\nevaluation of the\nFirm\u2019s assumptions\ninclusive of the\ninputs, as applicable.\n\n\u2022 We tested the\nrevenues arising from\nthe trade date fair\nvalue estimates for\nselected structured\ntransactions\nclassified as Level 3\nfinancial instruments.\nFor certain of our\nselected transactions,\nwe developed\nindependent fair value\nestimates to test the\nvaluation inputs and\nassumptions used by\nthe Firm and evaluated\nwhether these methods\nwere consistent with\nrelevant Firm\nvaluation policies.\n\n\u2022 We assessed the\nconsistency by which\nmanagement has applied\nsignificant and\nunobservable valuation\nassumptions used in\ndeveloping fair value\nestimates.\n\n\u2022 We performed a\nretrospective\nassessment of\nmanagement\u2019s fair\nvalue estimates for\ncertain of our\nselected Level 3\nfinancial instruments,\nfor which there were\nevents or transactions\noccurring after the\nvaluation date. We did\nso by comparing\nmanagement\u2019s estimates\nto the relevant\nevidence provided by\nsuch events or\ntransactions, as\napplicable.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nLLP\n\nNew York, New

Other\nactivities include\nresearch. Wealth\nManagement provides a\ncomprehensive array of\nfinancial services and\nsolutions to\nindividual investors\nand small to medium-\nsized businesses and\ninstitutions covering:\nfinancial advisor-led\nbrokerage, custody,\nadministrative and\ninvestment advisory\nservices; self-\ndirected brokerage\nservices; financial\nand wealth planning\nservices; workplace\nservices, including\nstock plan\nadministration;\nsecurities-based\nlending, residential\nreal estate loans and\nother lending\nproducts; banking; and\nretirement plan\nservices. Investment\nManagement provides a\nbroad range of\ninvestment strategies\nand products that span\ngeographies, asset\nclasses, and public\nand private markets to\na diverse group of\nclients across\ninstitutional and\nintermediary channels.\nStrategies and\nproducts, which are\noffered through a\nvariety of investment\nvehicles, include\nequity, fixed income,\nalternatives and\nsolutions, and\nliquidity and\n\noverlay services.\nInstitutional clients\ninclude defined\nbenefit/defined\ncontribution plans,\nfoundations,\nendowments, government\nentities, sovereign\nwealth funds,\ninsurance companies,\nthird-party fund\nsponsors and\ncorporations.\nIndividual clients are\ngenerally served\nthrough\nintermediaries,\nincluding affiliated\nand non-affiliated\ndistributors. Basis of\nFinancial Information\nThe financial\nstatements are\nprepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, which\nrequires the Firm to\nmake estimates and\nassumptions regarding\nthe valuations of\ncertain financial\ninstruments, the\nvaluations of goodwill\nand intangible assets,\nthe outcome of legal\nand tax matters,\ndeferred tax assets,\nACL, and other matters\nthat affect its\nfinancial statements\nand related\ndisclosures. The Firm\nbelieves that the\nestimates utilized in\nthe preparation of its\nfinancial statements\nare prudent and\nreasonable. Actual\nresults could differ\nmaterially from these\nestimates. The Notes\nare an integral part\nof the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nThe Firm has evaluated\nsubsequent events for\nadjustment to or\ndisclosure in these\nfinancial statements\nthrough the date of\nthis report and has\nnot identified any\nrecordable or\ndisclosable events not\notherwise reported in\nthese financial\nstatements or the\nnotes thereto.\nConsolidation The\nfinancial statements\ninclude the accounts\nof the Firm, its\nwholly owned\nsubsidiaries and other\nentities in which the\nFirm has a controlling\nfinancial interest,\nincluding certain VIEs\n(see Note 16).\nIntercompany balances\nand transactions have\nbeen eliminated. For\nconsolidated\nsubsidiaries that are\nnot wholly owned, the\nthird-party holdings\nof equity interests\nare referred to as\nNoncontrolling\ninterests. The net\nincome attributable to\nNoncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as Net\nincome applicable to\nnoncontrolling\ninterests in the\nincome statement. The\nportion of\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nthat is attributable\nto noncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as\nNoncontrolling\ninterests, a component\nof Total equity, in\nthe balance sheet. For\nentities where the\ntotal equity\ninvestment at risk is\nsufficient to enable\nthe entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional\nsubordinated financial\nsupport and the equity\nholders bear the\nresidual economic\nrisks and returns of\nthe entity and have\nthe power to direct\nthe activities of the\nentity that most\nsignificantly affect\nits economic\nperformance, the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities it controls\neither through a\nmajority voting\ninterest or otherwise.\nFor VIEs ( i.e. ,\nentities that do not\nmeet the\naforementioned\ncriteria), the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities where it has\nthe power to make the\ndecisions that most\nsignificantly affect\nthe economic\nperformance of the VIE\nand has the obligation\nto absorb losses or\nthe right to receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be\nsignificant to the\nVIE.\n                                 \n  77    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nFor investments in\nentities in which the\nFirm does not have a\ncontrolling financial\ninterest but has\nsignificant influence\nover operating and\nfinancial decisions,\nit applies the equity\nmethod of accounting\nwith net gains and\nlosses recorded within\nOther revenues (see\nNote 12) unless the\nFirm has elected to\nmeasure the investment\nat fair value, in\nwhich case net gains\nand losses are\nrecorded within\nInvestments revenues\n(see Note 5).

Significant Accounting Policies          \n                                              \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are\nrecognized when the\npromised goods or\nservices are delivered\nto our customers in an\namount that is based\non the consideration\nthe Firm expects to\nreceive in exchange\nfor those goods or\nservices when such\namounts are not\nprobable of\nsignificant reversal.\nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from\ninvestment banking\nactivities consist of\nrevenues earned from\nunderwriting,\nprimarily equity and\nfixed income\nsecurities and loan\nsyndications, and\nadvisory fees,\nprimarily for mergers,\nacquisitions and\nrestructurings.\nUnderwriting revenues\nare generally\nrecognized on trade\ndate if there is no\nuncertainty or\ncontingency related to\nthe amount to be paid.\nUnderwriting costs are\ndeferred and\nrecognized in the\nrelevant non-interest\nexpenses line items\nwhen the related\nunderwriting revenues\nare recorded. Advisory\nfees are recognized as\nadvice is provided to\nthe client, based on\nthe estimated progress\nof work and when\nrevenues are not\nprobable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nAdvisory costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems, including those\nreimbursed.\n\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee\nrevenues generally\nresult from\ntransaction-based\narrangements in which\nthe client is charged\na fee for the\nexecution of\ntransactions. Such\nrevenues primarily\narise from\ntransactions in equity\nsecurities; services\nrelated to sales and\ntrading activities;\nand sales of mutual\nfunds, alternative\nfunds, futures,\ninsurance products and\noptions, as well as\nrevenues from order\nflow payments for\ndirecting customer\norders to broker-\ndealers, exchanges,\nand market centers for\nexecution. Commission\nand fee revenues are\nrecognized on trade\ndate when the\nperformance obligation\nis satisfied. Asset\nManagement Revenues\nAsset management,\ndistribution and\nadministration fees\nare generally based on\nrelated asset levels\nbeing managed, such as\nthe AUM of a\ncustomer\u2019s account or\nthe net asset value of\na fund. These fees are\ngenerally recognized\nwhen services are\nperformed and the fees\nbecome known.\nManagement fees are\nreduced by estimated\nfee waivers and\nexpense caps, if any,\nprovided to the\ncustomer. Performance-\nbased fees not in the\nform of carried\ninterest are recorded\nwhen the annual\nperformance target is\nmet and the revenues\nare not probable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nSales commissions paid\nby the Firm in\nconnection with the\nsale of certain\nclasses of shares of\nits open-end mutual\nfund products are\naccounted for as\ndeferred commission\nassets and amortized\nto expense over the\nexpected life of the\ncontract. The Firm\nperiodically tests\ndeferred commission\nassets for\nrecoverability based\non cash flows expected\nto be received in\nfuture periods. Other\nasset management and\ndistribution costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems. Carried\nInterest The Firm is\nentitled to receive\nperformance-based fees\nin the form of carried\ninterest when the\nreturn in certain\nfunds exceeds\nspecified performance\ntargets. When the Firm\nearns carried interest\nfrom funds as\nspecified performance\nthresholds are met,\nthat carried interest\nand any related\ngeneral or limited\npartner interest are\naccounted for under\nthe equity method of\naccounting and\nmeasured based on the\nFirm\u2019s claim on the\nNAV of the fund at the\nreporting date, taking\ninto account the\ndistribution terms\napplicable to the\ninterest held. Such\nitems are reflected\nwithin Investment\nrevenues. See Note 23\nfor information\nregarding the net\ncumulative unrealized\namount of performance-\nbased fee revenues at\nrisk of reversal. See\nNote 15 for\ninformation regarding\ngeneral partner\nguarantees, which\ninclude potential\nobligations to return\nperformance fee\ndistributions\npreviously received.\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    78  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nOther Items Revenues from certain commodities-\nrelated contracts are recognized as the\npromised goods or services are delivered to\nthe customer. Receivables from contracts with\ncustomers are recognized in Customer and other\nreceivables in the balance sheet when the\nunderlying performance obligations have been\nsatisfied and the Firm has the right per the\ncontract to bill the customer. Contract assets\nare recognized in Other assets when the Firm\nhas satisfied its performance obligations but\ncustomer payment is conditional on something\nother than the passage of time. Contract\nliabilities are recognized in Other\nliabilities when the Firm has collected\npayment from a customer based on the terms of\nthe contract but the underlying performance\nobligations are not yet satisfied. For\ncontracts with a term of less than one year,\nincremental costs to obtain the contract are\nexpensed as incurred. Revenues are not\ndiscounted when payment is expected within one\nyear. The Firm generally presents, net within\nrevenues, taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and\nconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing\ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a\ncustomer. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and\ncash equivalents consist of Cash and due from\nbanks and Interest bearing deposits with\nbanks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid\ninvestments with remaining maturities of three\nmonths or less from the acquisition date that\nare readily convertible to cash and are not\nheld for trading purposes. Cash and cash\nequivalents also include Restricted cash such\nas cash segregated in compliance with federal\nor other regulations, including minimum\nreserve requirements set by the Federal\nReserve Bank and other central banks, and the\nFirm\u2019s initial margin deposited with clearing\norganizations. Fair Value of Financial\nInstruments Instruments within Trading assets\nand Trading liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue, either as required or allowed by\naccounting guidance. These financial\ninstruments primarily represent the Firm\u2019s\ntrading and investment positions and include\nboth cash and derivative products. In\naddition, securities classified as Available-\nfor-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) are measured at fair value.\nGains and losses on instruments carried at\nfair value are reflected in Trading revenues,\nInvestments revenues or Investment banking\nrevenues in the income statement, except for\ngains and losses related to AFS securities\n(see \u201cAFS Investment Securities\u201d section\nherein and Note 8) and derivatives accounted\nfor as hedges, as well as economic derivative\nhedges associated with certain held-for-sale\nand held-for-investment corporate loans and\nlending commitments (see \u201cHedge Accounting\u201d\nand \u201cOther Hedges\u201d herein and Note 7).\nInterest income and interest expense are\nrecorded within the income statement depending\non the nature of the instrument and related\nmarket conventions. When interest is included\nas a component of the instruments\u2019 fair value,\ninterest is recorded within Trading revenues\nor Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is\nrecorded within Interest income or Interest\nexpense. Dividend income is recorded in\nTrading revenues or Investments revenues\ndepending on the business activity. The fair\nvalue of OTC financial instruments, including\nderivative contracts related to financial\ninstruments and commodities, is presented in\nthe accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis, when appropriate.\nAdditionally, the Firm nets the fair value of\ncash collateral paid or received against the\nfair value amounts recognized for net\nderivative positions executed with the same\ncounterparty under the same master netting\nagreement. Fair Value Option The Firm has\nelected to measure certain eligible\ninstruments at fair value, including\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, Loans and lending commitments, equity\nmethod investments and certain other assets,\nDeposits, Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, Other secured financings and\nBorrowings. Fair Value Measurement\u2014Definition\nand Hierarchy Fair value is defined as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the\n\u201cexit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is a market-based measure\nconsidered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific\nmeasure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available,\nassumptions are set to reflect those that the\nFirm believes market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date. Where the Firm manages a\ngroup of financial assets, financial\nliabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted\nfor as derivatives on the basis of its net\nexposure to either market risks or credit\nrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that\ngroup of financial instruments consistently\nwith how market participants would price the\nnet risk exposure at the measurement date. In\ndetermining fair value, the Firm uses various\nvaluation approaches and establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue that requires the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are\ninputs that market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability that were\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from\nsources independent of the\n                                 \n  79    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nFirm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that\nreflect assumptions the Firm believes other\nmarket participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability that are developed based on\nthe best information available in the\ncircumstances. The fair value hierarchy is\nbroken down into three levels based on the\nobservability of inputs as follows, with Level\n1 being the highest and Level 3 being the\nlowest level: Level 1. Valuations based on\nquoted prices in active markets that the Firm\nhas the ability to access for identical assets\nor liabilities. Valuation adjustments, block\ndiscounts and discounts for entity-specific\nrestrictions that would not transfer to market\nparticipants are not applied to Level 1\ninstruments. Since valuations are based on\nquoted prices that are readily and regularly\navailable in an active market, valuation of\nthese products does not entail a significant\ndegree of judgment. Level 2. Valuations based\non one or more quoted prices in markets that\nare not active or for which all significant\ninputs are observable, either directly or\nindirectly. Level 3. Valuations based on\ninputs that are unobservable and significant\nto the overall fair value measurement. The\navailability of observable inputs can vary\nfrom product to product and is affected by a\nwide variety of factors, including the type of\nproduct, whether the product is new and not\nyet established in the marketplace, the\nliquidity of markets and other characteristics\nparticular to the product. To the extent that\nvaluation is based on models or inputs that\nare less observable or unobservable in the\nmarket, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the\ndegree of judgment exercised by the Firm in\ndetermining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. The Firm considers prices and\ninputs that are current as of the measurement\ndate, including during periods of market\ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation,\nthe observability of prices and inputs may be\nreduced for many instruments. This condition\ncould cause an instrument to be reclassified\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue may fall into different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total\nfair value amount is disclosed in the level\nappropriate for the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the total fair value of the\nasset or liability. Valuation Techniques Many\ncash instruments and OTC derivative contracts\nhave bid and ask prices that can be observed\nin the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the\nhighest price that a party is willing to pay\nfor an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest\nprice that a party is willing to accept for an\nasset. The Firm carries positions at the point\nwithin the bid-ask range that meets its best\nestimate of fair value. For offsetting\npositions in the same financial instrument,\nthe same price within the bid-ask spread is\nused to measure both the long and short\npositions. Fair value for many cash\ninstruments and OTC derivative contracts is\nderived using pricing models. Pricing models\ntake into account the contract terms, as well\nas multiple inputs, including, where\napplicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves,\ncorrelation, creditworthiness of the\ncounterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm,\noption volatility and currency rates. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty, and concentration risk and\nfunding in order to arrive at fair value.\nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-\nderived mid-market amounts of Level 2 and\nLevel 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid\nor mid-ask spread required to properly reflect\nthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and\nmid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed\nin trade activity, broker quotes or other\nexternal third-party data. Where these spreads\nare unobservable for the particular position\nin question, spreads are derived from\nobservable levels of similar positions. The\nFirm applies credit-related valuation\nadjustments to its Borrowings for which the\nfair value option was elected and to OTC\nderivatives. The Firm considers the impact of\nchanges in its own credit spreads based upon\nobservations of the secondary bond market\nspreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings. For OTC derivatives, the impact of\nchanges in both the Firm\u2019s and the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating is considered\nwhen measuring fair value. In determining the\nexpected exposure, the Firm simulates the\ndistribution of the future exposure to a\ncounterparty, then applies market-based\ndefault probabilities to the future exposure,\nleveraging external third-party CDS spread\ndata. Where CDS spread data are unavailable\nfor a specific counterparty, bond market\nspreads, CDS spread data based on the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating or CDS spread\ndata that reference a comparable counterparty\nmay be utilized. The Firm also considers\ncollateral held and legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that mitigate its exposure\nto each counterparty. Adjustments for model\nuncertainty are taken for positions whose\nunderlying models are reliant on significant\ninputs that are neither directly nor\nindirectly observable, hence requiring\nreliance on established theoretical concepts\nin their derivation. These adjustments are\nderived by making assessments of the possible\ndegree of variability using statistical\napproaches and market-based information where\npossible. The Firm may apply concentration\nadjustments to certain of its OTC derivative\nportfolios to reflect the additional cost of\nclosing out a particularly large risk\nexposure. Where possible, these adjustments\nare based on observable market information,\nbut in many instances, significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the costs of closing\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    80  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nout concentrated risk exposures due to the\nlack of liquidity in the marketplace. The Firm\napplies an FVA in the fair value measurements\nof OTC uncollateralized or partially\ncollateralized derivatives and in\ncollateralized derivatives where the terms of\nthe agreement do not permit the reuse of the\ncollateral received. In general, FVA reflects\na market funding risk premium inherent in the\nnoted derivative instruments. The methodology\nfor measuring FVA leverages the Firm\u2019s\nexisting credit-related valuation adjustment\ncalculation methodologies, which apply to both\nassets and liabilities. See Note 5 for a\ndescription of valuation techniques applied to\nthe major categories of financial instruments\nmeasured at fair value. Assets and Liabilities\nMeasured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring\nBasis Certain of the Firm\u2019s assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnon-recurring basis. The Firm incurs losses or\ngains for any adjustments of these assets or\nliabilities to fair value. For assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis, fair value is determined by\nusing various valuation approaches. The same\nhierarchy for inputs as described above, which\nrequires that observable inputs be used when\navailable, is used in measuring fair value for\nthese items. For further information on\nfinancial assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis, see Note 5. Offsetting of\nDerivative Instruments In connection with its\nderivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and\ncollateral agreements with its counterparties.\nThese agreements provide the Firm with the\nright, in the event of a default by the\ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under the agreement and to\nliquidate and set off cash collateral against\nany net amount owed by the counterparty.\nDerivatives with enforceable master netting\nagreements are reported net of cash collateral\nreceived and posted. However, in certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may not have such an\nagreement in place; the relevant insolvency\nregime may not support the enforceability of\nthe master netting agreement or collateral\nagreement; or the Firm may not have sought\nlegal advice to support the enforceability of\nthe agreement. In cases where the Firm has not\ndetermined an agreement to be enforceable, the\nrelated amounts are not offset (see Note 7).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash\nand/or securities posted as collateral (with\nrights of rehypothecation), irrespective of\nthe enforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In\ncertain cases, the Firm may agree for such\ncollateral to be posted to a third-party\ncustodian under a control agreement that\nenables it to take control of such collateral\nin the event of a counterparty default. The\nenforceability of the master netting agreement\nis taken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement practices and application of\ncounterparty credit limits. For information\nrelated to offsetting of derivatives, see Note\n7. Hedge Accounting The Firm applies hedge\naccounting using various derivative financial\ninstruments for the following types of hedges:\nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets\nand liabilities due to the risk being hedged\n(fair value hedges); hedges of variability in\nforecasted cash flows from floating-rate\nassets due to contractually specified interest\nrates (cash flow hedges) and hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations whose\nfunctional currency is different from the\nreporting currency of the Parent Company (net\ninvestment hedges). These financial\ninstruments are included within Trading\nassets\u2014Derivative and other contracts or\nTrading liabilities\u2014Derivative and other\ncontracts in the balance sheet. For hedges\nwhere hedge accounting is being applied, the\nFirm performs effectiveness testing and other\nprocedures. The change in the fair value of\nthe designated portion of the hedging\ninstrument should be highly correlated,\nbetween 80and 125percent of the change in the\nfair value, cash flows, or carrying value (due\nto translation gains or losses) of the hedged\nitem attributable to the risk being hedged.\nThe Firm considers the impact of valuation\nadjustments related to counterparty credit\nspreads and its own credit spreads to\ndetermine whether they would cause the hedging\nrelationship to be ineffective. Fair Value\nHedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk The Firm\u2019s\ndesignated fair value hedges consist of\ninterest rate swaps designated as hedges of\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate of\ncertain fixed rate AFS securities and senior\nborrowings. The Firm also designates interest\nrate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate of certain fixed\nrate deposits. The Firm is permitted to hedge\nthe full, or part of the contractual term of\nthe hedged instrument. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to perform an ongoing\nprospective and retrospective assessment of\nthe effectiveness of these hedging\nrelationships. For qualifying fair value\nhedges of benchmark interest rates, the change\nin the fair value of the derivative, offset by\nthe change in the fair value attributable to\nthe change in the benchmark interest rate risk\nof the hedged asset (liability), is recognized\nin earnings each period as a component of\nInterest income (expense). For AFS securities,\nthe change in fair value of the hedged item\ndue to changes other than the risk being\nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI.\nWhen a derivative is de-designated as a hedge,\nany basis adjustment remaining on the hedged\nasset (liability) is amortized to Interest\nincome (expense) over the\n                                 \n  81    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nremaining life of the\nasset (liability)\nusing the effective\ninterest method. Net\nInvestment Hedges The\nFirm uses forward\nforeign exchange\ncontracts to manage a\nportion of the\ncurrency exposure\nrelating to its net\ninvestments in foreign\noperations. To the\nextent that the\nnotional amounts of\nthe hedging\ninstruments equal the\nportion of the\ninvestments being\nhedged and the\nunderlying exchange\nrate of the derivative\nhedging instrument is\nthe same as the\nexchange rate between\nthe functional\ncurrency of the\ninvestee and the\nintermediate parent\nentity\u2019s functional\ncurrency, it is\nconsidered to be\nperfectly effective,\nwith no income\nstatement recognition.\nThe gain or loss from\nrevaluing hedges of\nnet investments in\nforeign operations at\nthe spot rate is\nreported within AOCI.\nThe forward points on\nthe hedging\ninstruments are\nexcluded from hedge\neffectiveness testing\nand changes in the\nfair value of this\nexcluded component are\nrecorded currently in\nInterest income. Cash\nFlow Hedges\u2014Interest\nRate Risk The Firm\u2019s\ndesignated cash flow\nhedges consist of\ninterest rate\nderivatives designated\nas hedges of\nvariability in\nforecasted cash flows\nfrom floating-rate\nassets due to changes\nin the contractually\nspecified interest\nrates. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to\nperform an ongoing\nprospective and\nretrospective\nassessment of the\neffectiveness of these\nhedging relationships.\nThe objective of this\nstrategy is to hedge\nthe risk of changes in\nthe hedged item\u2019s cash\nflows attributable to\nchanges in the\ncontractually\nspecified interest\nrate. For qualifying\ncash flow hedges of\ncontractually\nspecified interest\nrates, changes in the\nfair value of the\nderivative are\nrecorded in OCI and\nsubsequently\nreclassified to\nearnings in the same\nperiods when the\nhedged item affects\nearnings. If cash flow\nhedge accounting is\ndiscontinued, AOCI is\nreleased into earnings\nimmediately if the\ncash flow of the\nhedged item is\nprobable of not\noccurring. Otherwise\nthe amount in AOCI is\nreleased into earnings\nas the forecasted\ntransaction affects\nearnings. Other Hedges\nIn addition to hedges\nthat are designated\nand qualify for hedge\naccounting, the Firm\nuses derivatives to\neconomically hedge\ncredit risk associated\nwith certain held-for-\nsale and held-for-\ninvestment corporate\nloans and lending\ncommitments, and the\nrelated gains and\nlosses are reported\nwithin Other revenues\nin the income\nstatement. For further\ninformation on\nderivative instruments\nand hedging\nactivities, see Note\n7. AFS Investment\nSecurities AFS\nsecurities are\nreported at fair value\nin the balance sheet.\nInterest income,\nincluding amortization\nof premiums and\naccretion of\ndiscounts, is included\nin Interest income in\nthe\nincome statement. Unrealized gains are\nrecorded in OCI, and unrealized losses are\nrecorded either in OCI or in Other revenues as\ndescribed below.\n\nAFS securities in an unrealized loss position\nare first evaluated to determine whether there\nis an intent to sell or it is more likely than\nnot the Firm will be required to sell before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. If so,\nthe amortized cost basis is written down to\nthe fair value of the security such that the\nentire unrealized loss is recognized in Other\nrevenues, and any previously established ACL\nis written off.\n\nFor all other AFS securities in an unrealized\nloss position, any portion of unrealized\nlosses representing a credit loss is\nrecognized in Other revenues and as an\nincrease to the ACL for AFS securities, with\nthe remainder of unrealized losses recognized\nin OCI. A credit loss exists if the Firm does\nnot expect to recover the amortized cost basis\nof the security. When considering whether a\ncredit loss exists, the Firm considers\nrelevant information, including:\n\n\u2022 guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the\nU.S. government;\n\n\u2022 the extent to which the fair value has been\nless than the amortized cost basis;\n\n\u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to\nthe security, its industry or geographic area;\n\n\u2022 changes in the financial condition of the\nissuer of the security or, in the case of an\nasset-backed debt security, changes in the\nfinancial condition of the underlying loan\nobligors;\n\n\u2022 the payment structure of the debt security\nand the likelihood of the issuer being able to\nmake payments that increase in the future;\n\n\u2022 failure of the issuer of the security to\nmake scheduled interest or principal payments;\n\n\u2022 the current rating and any changes to the\nrating of the security by a rating agency.\n\nIf a credit loss exists, the Firm measures the\ncredit loss as the difference between the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected (discounted at the implicit interest\nrate at acquisition of the security or\ndiscounted at the effective yield for\nsecurities that incorporate changes in\nprepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost\nbasis of the security. Changes in prepayment\nassumptions alone are not considered to result\nin a credit loss. When estimating the present\nvalue of expected cash flows, information\nutilized includes the remaining payment terms\nof the security, prepayment speeds, financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and\nthe value of any underlying collateral.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                Provision     \n                 ACL            for           \n                                Credit        \n                                Losses        \n  AFS            Contra         Other         \n  securities     investment     revenue       \n                 securities                   \n                                              \n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    82  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNonaccrual & ACL Charge-offs on AFS Securities\nAFS securities follow the same nonaccrual and\nwrite-off guidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d herein. HTM Securities HTM\nsecurities are reported at amortized cost, net\nof any ACL, in the balance sheet. Refer to\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein for\nguidance on the ACL determination. Interest\nincome, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on HTM securities, is\nincluded in Interest income in the income\nstatement. Loans The Firm accounts for loans\nbased on the following categories: loans held\nfor investment; loans held for sale; and loans\nat fair value. Nonaccrual All loan categories\ndescribed below follow the same nonaccrual and\nwrite-off guidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d herein. Loans Held for\nInvestment Loans held for investment are\nreported at outstanding principal adjusted for\nany charge-offs, the allowance for credit\nlosses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs\nfor originated loans, and any unamortized\npremiums or discounts for purchased loans.\nInterest Income. Interest income on performing\nloans held for investment is accrued and\nrecognized as interest income at the\ncontractual rate of interest. Purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums, as well as net deferred\nloan fees or costs, are amortized into\ninterest income over the life of the loan to\nproduce a level rate of return. Lending\nCommitments. The Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the credit exposure\nrelated to commitments to fund loans. For more\ninformation regarding loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, see Note 15. For more information\nregarding allowance for credit losses, refer\nto \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein. Loans\nHeld for Sale Loans held for sale are measured\nat the lower of amortized cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes recorded in Other\nrevenues. The Firm determines the valuation\nallowance on an individual loan basis, except\nfor residential mortgage loans for which the\nvaluation allowance is determined at the loan\nproduct level. Any decreases in fair value\nbelow the initial carrying amount and any\nrecoveries in fair value up to the initial\ncarrying amount are recorded in Other\nrevenues. Increases in fair value above\ninitial carrying value are not recognized.\nInterest Income. Interest income on loans held\nfor sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums are deferred as an\nadjustment to the loan\u2019s cost basis until the\nrelated loan is sold and, as such, are\nincluded in the periodic determination of the\nlower of cost or fair value adjustments and\nthe gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Lending Commitments. Commitments to fund\nmortgage loans held for sale are derivatives\nand are reported in Trading assets or Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheet with an\noffset to Trading revenues in the income\nstatement. For commitments to fund non-\nmortgage loans, the Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the fair value\nexposure below cost of such commitments in\nOther liabilities and accrued expenses in the\nbalance sheet with an offset to Other revenues\nin the income statement. Because loans and\nlending commitments held for sale are\nrecognized at the lower of cost or fair value,\nthe allowance for credit losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. Loans at\nFair Value Loans for which the fair value\noption is elected are carried at fair value,\nwith changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings. For further information on loans\ncarried at fair value and classified as\nTrading assets and Trading liabilities, see\nNote 5. Lending Commitments. The Firm records\nthe liability and related expense for the fair\nvalue exposure related to commitments to fund\nloans that will be measured at fair value. The\nliability is recorded in Trading liabilities\nin the balance sheet, and the expense is\nrecorded in Trading revenues in the income\nstatement. Because such loans and lending\ncommitments are reported at fair value, the\nallowance for credit losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. For\nfurther information on loans, see Note 10.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The ACL for\nfinancial instruments measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (\ne.g., HFI loans and lending commitments, HTM\nsecurities, customer and other receivables and\ncertain guarantees) represents an estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the entire life of\nthe financial instrument. Factors considered\nby management when determining the ACL include\npayment status, fair value of collateral and\n                                 \n  83    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nexpected payments of\nprincipal and\ninterest, as well as\ninternal or external\ninformation relating\nto past events,\ncurrent conditions,\nand reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\nThe Firm uses three\nforecasts that include\nassumptions about\ncertain macroeconomic\nvariables, including,\nbut not limited to,\nU.S. gross domestic\nproduct (\u201cGDP\u201d),\nequity market indices\nand unemployment\nrates, as well as\ncommercial real estate\nand home price\nindices. At the\nconclusion of the\nFirm\u2019s reasonable and\nsupportable forecast\nperiod of 13 quarters,\nthere is a gradual\nreversion back to\nhistorical averages.\nThe ACL is measured on\na collective basis\nwhen similar risk\ncharacteristics exist\nfor multiple\ninstruments,\nconsidering all\navailable information\nrelevant to assessing\nthe collectability of\ncash flows. Generally,\nthe Firm applies a\nprobability of\ndefault/loss given\ndefault model for\ninstruments that are\ncollectively assessed,\nunder which the ACL is\ncalculated as the\nproduct of probability\nof default, loss given\ndefault and exposure\nat default. These\nparameters are\nforecast for each\ncollective group of\nassets using a\nscenario-based\nstatistical model. If\nthe instrument does\nnot share similar risk\ncharacteristics with\nother instruments,\nincluding when it is\nprobable that the Firm\nwill be unable to\ncollect the full\npayment of principal\nand interest on the\ninstrument when due,\nthe ACL is measured on\nan individual basis.\nThe Firm generally\napplies a discounted\ncash flow method for\ninstruments that are\nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also\nelect to use an\napproach that\nconsiders the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral when\nmeasuring the ACL if\nthe loan is collateral\ndependent ( i.e.,\nrepayment of the loan\nis expected to be\nprovided substantially\nby the sale or\noperation of the\nunderlying collateral\nand the borrower is\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm\ncan elect to use an\napproach to measure\nthe ACL that considers\nthe fair value of\ncollateral where the\nborrower is required\nto, and reasonably\nexpected to,\ncontinually adjust and\nreplenish the amount\nof collateral securing\nthe instrument to\nreflect changes in the\nfair value of such\ncollateral. The Firm\nhas elected to use\nthis approach for\ncertain securities-\nbased loans, margin\nloans, securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell\nand securities\nborrowed. Credit\nquality indicators\nconsidered in\ndeveloping the ACL\ninclude: \u2022 Corporate\nloans, secured lending\nfacilities, commercial\nreal estate loans and\nsecurities, and other\nloans: Internal risk\nratings developed by\nthe CRM that are\nrefreshed at least\nannually, and more\nfrequently as\nnecessary. These\nratings generally\ncorrespond to external\nratings published by\nS&P. The Firm also\nconsiders transaction\nstructure, including\ntype of collateral,\ncollateral terms and\nposition of the\nobligation within the\ncapital structure. In\naddition, for\ncommercial real\nestate, the Firm\nconsiders property\ntype\n\nand location, net\noperating income and\nLTV ratios, among\nother factors, as well\nas commercial real\nestate price and\ncredit spread indices\nand capitalization\nrates. \u2022 Residential\nreal estate loans:\nLoan origination Fair\nIsaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores\nas determined by\nindependent credit\nagencies in the U.S.\nand LTV ratios. \u2022\nEmployee loans:\nEmployment status,\nwhich includes those\ncurrently employed by\nthe Firm and for which\nthe Firm can deduct\nany unpaid amounts due\nto it through certain\ncompensation\narrangements; and\nthose no longer\nemployed by the Firm\nwhere such\narrangements are no\nlonger applicable.\nQualitative and\nenvironmental factors\nsuch as economic and\nbusiness conditions,\nthe nature and volume\nof the portfolio, and\nlending terms and the\nvolume and severity of\npast due loans are\nalso considered in the\nACL calculations.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                 Provision    \n                 ACL             for          \n                                 Credit       \n                                 Losses       \n  Held for                       Provision    \n  investment     Contra asset    for credit   \n  loans                          losses       \n  Other                                       \n  instruments                                 \n  measured at                                 \n  amortized                                   \n  cost                           Other        \n  (e.g.,HTM      Contra asset    revenues     \n  securities                                  \n  and                                         \n  customer                                    \n  and other                                   \n  receivable\u2026                                 \n                                 Compensati\u2026  \n  Employee       Contra asset    and          \n  loans                          benefits     \n                                 expenses     \n  Held for       Other           Provision    \n  investment     liabilities     for credit   \n  lending        and accrued     losses       \n  commitments    expenses                     \n  Other                                       \n  off-balance    Other                        \n  sheet          liabilities     Other        \n  instruments    and accrued     expenses     \n  (e.g.,cert\u2026    expenses                     \n  guarantees)                                 \n                                              \nTroubled Debt\nRestructurings The\nFirm may modify the\nterms of certain loans\nfor economic or legal\nreasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial\ndifficulties by\ngranting one or more\nconcessions that the\nFirm would not\notherwise consider.\nSuch modifications are\naccounted for and\nreported as troubled\ndebt restructurings\n(\u201cTDR\u201d). A loan that\nhas been modified in a\nTDR is generally\nconsidered to be\nimpaired and is\nevaluated\nindividually. TDRs are\nalso generally\nclassified as\nnonaccrual and may be\nreturned to accrual\nstatus only after the\nFirm expects repayment\nof the remaining\ncontractual principal\nand interest and there\nis sustained repayment\nperformance for a\nreasonable period.\nNonaccrual The Firm\nplaces financial\ninstruments on\nnonaccrual status if\nprincipal or interest\nis not expected when\ncontractually due or\nis past due for a\nperiod of 90 days or\nmore unless the\nobligation is well-\nsecured and is in the\nprocess of collection.\nFor any instrument\nplaced on nonaccrual\nstatus, the Firm\nreverses any unpaid\ninterest accrued with\nan offsetting\nreduction to Interest\nincome. Principal and\ninterest payments\nreceived on nonaccrual\ninstruments are\napplied to principal\nif there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate\ncollectability of\nprincipal. If\ncollection of the\nprincipal is not in\ndoubt, interest income\nis realized on a cash\nbasis. If the\ninstrument is brought\ncurrent and neither\nprincipal nor interest\ncollection is in\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    84  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ndoubt, instruments can\ngenerally return to\naccrual status, and\ninterest income can be\nrecognized. ACL\nCharge-offs The\nprincipal balance of a\nfinancial instrument\nis charged off in the\nperiod it is deemed\nuncollectible,\nresulting in a\nreduction in the ACL\nand in the balance of\nthe financial\ninstrument in the\nbalance sheet. Accrued\ninterest receivable\nbalances that are\nseparately recorded\nfrom the related\nfinancial instruments\nare charged off\nagainst Interest\nincome when the\nrelated financial\ninstrument is placed\non nonaccrual status.\nAccordingly, the Firm\nelected not to measure\nan ACL for accrued\ninterest receivables.\nTransfers of Financial\nAssets Transfers of\nfinancial assets are\naccounted for as sales\nwhen the Firm has\nrelinquished control\nover the transferred\nassets. Any related\ngain or loss on sale\nis recorded in Net\nrevenues. Transfers\nthat are not accounted\nfor as sales are\ntreated as\ncollateralized\nfinancings. Securities\nborrowed or purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nloaned or sold under\nagreements to\nrepurchase are treated\nas collateralized\nfinancings (see Note\n9). Securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell\n(\u201creverse repurchase\nagreements\u201d) and\nSecurities sold under\nagreements to\nrepurchase\n(\u201crepurchase\nagreements\u201d),\nincluding repurchase\nand reverse repurchase\nagreements-to-\nmaturity, are carried\nin the balance sheet\nat the amount of cash\npaid or received plus\naccrued interest\nexcept for certain\nreverse repurchase and\nrepurchase agreements\nfor which the Firm has\nelected the fair value\noption (see Note 6).\nWhere appropriate,\nrepurchase agreements\nand reverse repurchase\nagreements with the\nsame counterparty are\nreported on a net\nbasis. Securities\nborrowed and\nsecurities loaned are\nrecorded at the amount\nof cash collateral\nadvanced or received.\nIn instances where the\nFirm is the lender in\nsecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions and is\npermitted to sell or\nrepledge these\nsecurities, the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral received is\nreported in Trading\nassets, and the\nrelated obligation to\nreturn the collateral\nis reported in Trading\nliabilities in the\nbalance sheet.\nSecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions where the\nFirm is the borrower\nare not included in\nthe balance sheet. In\norder to manage credit\nexposure arising from\nthese transactions, in\nappropriate\ncircumstances, the\nFirm enters into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral agreements\nwith its\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide the\nFirm with the right,\nin the event of a\ndefault by the\ncounterparty, to net a\ncounterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under\nthe agreement and to\nliquidate and set off\ncollateral held by the\nFirm against the net\namount owed by the\ncounterparty. The\nFirm\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to take\npossession of\nsecurities purchased\nor borrowed in\nconnection with\nreverse repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions,\nrespectively, and to\nreceive cash and/or\nsecurities delivered\nunder\n\nrepurchase agreements\nor securities loaned\ntransactions (with\nrights of\nrehypothecation).

The Firm\ntests indefinite-lived\nintangible assets for\nimpairment at the\naggregate level of\nmanagement contracts.\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, the\nFirm has the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, the\nFirm compares the fair\nvalue with the\ncarrying amount. If\nthe fair value is less\nthan the carrying\namount, the impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited to the\ncarrying amount.

The Firm has granted PSUs that\nvest and convert to shares of common stock\nonly if predetermined performance and market\ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the PSUs are included in\ndiluted EPS based on the number of shares (if\nany) that would be issuable if the reporting\ndate was the end of the performance period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings\n(loss) per common share, see Note 18 to the\nfinancial statements. Deferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation The Firm measures\ncompensation expense for stock-based awards at\nfair value. The Firm determines the fair value\nof RSUs (including PSUs with non-market\nperformance conditions) based on the grant-\ndate fair value of its common stock, measured\nas the volume-weighted average price on the\ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs\nnot entitled to dividends until conversion is\nmeasured at VWAP reduced by the present value\nof dividends expected to be paid on the\nunderlying shares prior to scheduled\nconversion date. PSUs that contain market-\nbased conditions are valued using a Monte\nCarlo valuation model. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nCompensation expense for awards with\nperformance conditions is recognized based on\nthe probable outcome of the performance\ncondition at each reporting date. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market-based\nconditions is recognized irrespective of the\nprobability of the market condition being\nachieved and is not reversed if the market\ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards\ngenerally contain clawback and cancellation\nprovisions. Certain awards provide the Firm\ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a\nportion of the award under specified\ncircumstances. Compensation expense for those\nawards is adjusted for changes in the fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s common stock or the\nrelevant model valuation, as appropriate,\nuntil conversion, exercise or expiration. The\nFirm also operates an Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (\u201cESPP\u201d) which allows U.S. employees to\npurchase shares of the Firm at a discount.\nEmployee Stock Trusts In connection with\ncertain stock-based compensation plans, the\nFirm has established employee stock trusts to\nprovide, at its discretion, common stock\nvoting rights to certain RSU holders.\nFollowing the grant of an RSU award, when a\nstock trust is utilized, the Firm contributes\nshares to be held in the stock trust until the\nRSUs convert to common shares. The assets of\nthe employee stock trusts are consolidated\nwith those of the Firm and are generally\naccounted for in a manner similar to treasury\nstock, where the shares of common stock\noutstanding reported in Common stock issued to\nemployee stock trusts are offset by an equal\namount reported in Employee stock trusts in\nthe balance sheet. The Firm uses the grant-\ndate fair value of stock-based compensation as\nthe basis for recording the movement of the\nassets to or from the employee stock trusts.\nChanges in the fair value are not recognized\nas the Firm\u2019s stock-based compensation must be\nsettled by delivery of a fixed number of\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock. Deferred\nCash-Based Compensation Compensation expense\nfor deferred cash-based compensation awards is\ncalculated based on the notional value of the\naward granted, adjusted for changes in the\nfair value of the referenced investments that\nemployees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of deferred\nawards. The Firm invests directly, as a\nprincipal, in financial instruments and other\ninvestments to economically hedge certain of\nits obligations under its deferred cash-based\ncompensation plans. Changes in the value of\nsuch investments are recorded in Trading\nrevenues and Investments revenues. Although\nchanges in compensation expense resulting from\nchanges in the fair value of the referenced\ninvestments will generally be offset by\nchanges in the fair value of investments made\nby the Firm, there is typically a timing\ndifference between the immediate recognition\nof gains and losses on the Firm\u2019s investments\nand the deferred recognition of the related\ncompensation expense over the vesting period.\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    86  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nRetirement-Eligible Employee Compensation For\nyear-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-\nbased compensation awards anticipated to be\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees under\naward terms that do not contain a future\nservice requirement, the Firm accrues the\nestimated cost of the awards over the course\nof the calendar year preceding the grant date,\nwhich reflects the period over which the\ncompensation is earned. Carried Interest\nCompensation The Firm generally recognizes\ncompensation expense for any portion of\ncarried interest (both realized and\nunrealized) that is allocated to employees.\nFor information on performance-based fees in\nthe form of carried interest, which are\ndirectly related to carried interest\ncompensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014Carried\nInterest\u201d herein. Income Taxes Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based upon\nthe temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and income tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using currently enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The\neffect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in\nincome tax expense (benefit) in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. Such effects\nare recorded in Provision for income taxes\nregardless of where deferred taxes were\noriginally recorded. The Firm recognizes net\ndeferred tax assets to the extent that it\nbelieves these assets are more likely than not\nto be realized. In making such a\ndetermination, the Firm considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence,\nincluding future reversals of existing taxable\ntemporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and\nresults of recent operations. When performing\nthe assessment, the Firm considers all types\nof deferred tax assets in combination with\neach other, regardless of the origin of the\nunderlying temporary difference. If a deferred\ntax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. If the\nFirm subsequently determines that it would be\nable to realize deferred tax assets in excess\nof their net recorded amount, it would make an\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes. The Firm recognizes tax\nexpense associated with Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income as it is incurred as part of the\ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period. Uncertain tax\npositions are recorded on the basis of a two-\nstep process, whereby (i) the Firm determines\nwhether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis\nof the technical merits of the position and\n(ii) for those tax positions that meet this\nthreshold, the Firm recognizes the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon ultimate settlement\nwith the related tax authority. Interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\nare recognized as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes. Foreign Currencies Assets\nand liabilities of operations with non-U.S.\ndollar functional currencies are translated at\nyear-end rates of exchange. Gains or losses\nresulting from translating foreign currency\nfinancial statements, net of hedge gains or\nlosses and related tax effects, are reflected\nin AOCI in the balance sheet. Gains or losses\nresulting from remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in net\nincome, and amounts recognized in the income\nstatement are translated at the rate of\nexchange on the respective date of recognition\nfor each amount. Accounting Update Adopted in\n2022 Reference Rate Reform The Firm has\nadopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting\nupdate, which extends the period of time\nentities can utilize the reference rate reform\nrelief guidance from December 31, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2024. The relief provides\noptional expedients and exceptions for\napplying generally accepted accounting\nprinciples to contracts, hedging relationships\nand other transactions that reference LIBOR or\nother interest rate benchmarks for which the\nreferenced rate is expected to be discontinued\nor replaced. The Firm is applying the\naccounting relief as relevant contract and\nhedge accounting relationship modifications\nare made during the course of the reference\nrate reform transition period. There was no\nimpact to the Firm\u2019s financial statements upon\nissuance of this accounting standard update.\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2020 Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses The Firm has adopted\nthe Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\naccounting update. This accounting update\nimpacted the impairment model for certain\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost by\nrequiring a CECL methodology to estimate\nexpected credit losses over the entire life of\nthe financial asset, recorded at inception or\npurchase. CECL replaced the incurred loss\nmodel previously applicable to loans held for\ninvestment, HTM securities and other\nreceivables carried at amortized cost, such as\nemployee loans. The update also eliminated the\nconcept of other-than-temporary impairment for\nAFS securities and instead requires\nimpairments on AFS securities to be recognized\nin earnings through an allowance when the fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost and a credit\nloss exists, and through a permanent reduction\nof the amortized cost basis when the\nsecurities are expected to be sold before\nrecovery of amortized cost.\n                                 \n  87    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAt transition on\nJanuary 1, 2020, the\nadoption of this\naccounting standard\nresulted in an\nincrease in the\nallowance for credit\nlosses of $ 131million\nwith a corresponding\nreduction in Retained\nearnings of $\n100million, net of\ntax. The adoption\nimpact was primarily\nattributable to a $\n124million increase in\nthe allowance for\ncredit losses on\nemployee loans. 3.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Eaton\nVance\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the\nFirm completed the\nacquisition of 100% of\nEaton Vance in a stock\nand cash transaction,\nwhich increased the\nscale and breadth of\nthe Investment\nManagement business\nsegment. Total\nconsideration for the\ntransaction was\napproximately $\n8.7billion, which\nconsisted of the $\n5.3billion fair value\nof 69million common\nshares issued from\nCommon stock held in\ntreasury and cash of\napproximately $\n3.4billion.\n\nUpon acquisition, the\nassets and liabilities\nof Eaton Vance were\nadjusted to their\nrespective fair values\nas of the closing date\nof the transaction,\nincluding the\nidentifiable\nintangible assets\nacquired. In addition,\nthe excess of the\npurchase price over\nthe fair value of the\nnet assets acquired\nwas recorded as\ngoodwill.

Other model inputs such as credit\nspreads, including collateral spreads and\ninterest rates, are typically observable. \u2022\nAsset-backed CDOs are valued based on an\nevaluation of the market and model input\nparameters sourced from comparable instruments\nas indicated by market activity.

Many pricing models do\nnot entail material subjectivity as the\nmethodologies employed do not necessitate\nsignificant judgment since model inputs may be\nobserved from actively quoted markets, as is\nthe case for generic interest rate swaps, many\nequity, commodity and foreign currency option\ncontracts, and certain CDS. In the case of\nmore established derivative products, the\npricing models used by the Firm are widely\naccepted by the financial services industry. \u2022\nMore complex OTC derivative products are\ntypically less liquid and require more\njudgment in the implementation of the\nvaluation technique since direct trading\nactivity or quotes are unobservable. This\nincludes certain types of interest rate\nderivatives with both volatility and\ncorrelation exposure, equity, commodity or\nforeign currency derivatives that are either\nlonger-dated or include exposure to multiple\nunderlyings, and credit derivatives, including\nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities and basket CDS. Where required\ninputs are unobservable, relationships to\nobservable data points, based on historical\nand/or implied observations, may be employed\nas a technique to estimate the model input\nvalues.

These investments are included in the\nFund Interests table in the \u201cNet Asset Value\nMeasurements\u201d section herein. \u2022 For non-\nexchange-traded investments either held\ndirectly or held within internally managed\nfunds, fair value after initial recognition is\nbased on an assessment of each underlying\ninvestment, considering rounds of financing\nand third-party transactions, discounted cash\nflow analyses and market-based information,\nincluding comparable Firm transactions,\ntrading multiples and changes in market\noutlook, among other factors.

Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer\nin the third quarter of $ 895million of equity\nmargin loans from Level 3 to Level 2 as a\nresult of the reduced significance of the\nmargin loan rate input. Net transfers in 2020\nreflect the largely offsetting impacts of\nequity margin loan transfers of $ 857million\ninto Level 3 in the first quarter and $\n707million out of Level 3 in the second\nquarter, both driven by changes in the\nsignificance level of the margin loan rate\ninput based on changes in liquidity\nconditions.\n\n2. Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer\nin the second quarter of $ 2.0billion of\nCorporate and other debt, $ 1.0billion of net\nEquity derivatives and $ 2.2billion of\nBorrowings from Level 3 to Level 2 as the\nunobservable inputs were not significant to\nthe overall fair value measurements.\n\n3. Net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer\nin the first quarter of $ 2.5billion of AFS\nsecurities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to\nincreased trading activity and observability\nof pricing inputs. Purchases of AFS investment\nsecurities in 2020 relate to securities\nacquired as part of the E*TRADE transaction.\nFor additional information on the acquisition\nof E*TRADE, see Note 3.\nLevel 3 instruments\nmay be hedged with\ninstruments classified\nin Level 1 and Level\n2.

The\nunrealized gains\n(losses) during the\nperiod for assets and\nliabilities within the\nLevel 3 category may\ninclude changes in\nfair value during the\nperiod that were\nattributable to

The\nlevel of aggregation\nand breadth of\nproducts cause the\nrange of inputs to be\nwide and not evenly\ndistributed across the\ninventory of financial\ninstruments. Further,\nthe range of\nunobservable inputs\nmay differ across\nfirms in the financial\nservices industry\nbecause of diversity\nin the types of\nproducts included in\neach firm\u2019s inventory.\nGenerally, there are\nno predictable\nrelationships between\nmultiple significant\nunobservable inputs\nattributable to a\ngiven valuation\ntechnique. During\n2022, there were no\nsignificant revisions\nmade to the\ndescriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s significant\nunobservable inputs.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a higher (lower)\nfair value. \u2022\nComparable Bond or\nLoan Price. A pricing\ninput used when prices\nfor the identical\ninstrument are not\navailable. Significant\nsubjectivity may be\ninvolved when fair\nvalue is determined\nusing pricing data\navailable for\ncomparable\ninstruments. Valuation\nusing comparable\ninstruments can be\ndone by calculating an\nimplied yield (or\nspread over a liquid\nbenchmark) from the\nprice of a comparable\nbond or loan, then\nadjusting that yield\n(or spread) to derive\na value for the bond\nor loan. The\nadjustment to yield\n(or spread) should\naccount for relevant\ndifferences in the\nbonds or\n                                 \n  97    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nloans such as maturity or credit quality.\nAlternatively, a price-to-price basis can be\nassumed between the comparable instrument and\nthe bond or loan being valued in order to\nestablish the value of the bond or loan. \u2022\nComparable Equity Price. A price derived from\nequity raises, share buybacks and external bid\nlevels, etc. A discount or premium may be\nincluded in the fair value estimate. \u2022\nContingency Probability. Probability\nassociated with the realization of an\nunderlying event upon which the value of an\nasset is contingent. \u2022 EBITDA Multiple/Exit\nMultiple. The ratio of Enterprise Value to\nEBITDA, where enterprise value is the\naggregate value of equity and debt minus cash\nand cash equivalents. The EBITDA multiple\nreflects the value of a company in terms of\nits full-year EBITDA, whereas the exit\nmultiple reflects the value of a company in\nterms of its full-year expected EBITDA at\nexit. Either multiple allows comparison\nbetween companies from an operational\nperspective as the effect of capital\nstructure, taxation and\ndepreciation/amortization is excluded. An\nincrease (decrease) to the following\nsignificant unobservable inputs would\ngenerally result in a lower (higher) fair\nvalue. \u2022 Cash-Synthetic Basis. The measure of\nthe price differential between cash financial\ninstruments and their synthetic derivative-\nbased equivalents. The range disclosed in the\nprevious table signifies the number of points\nby which the synthetic bond equivalent price\nis higher than the quoted price of the\nunderlying cash bonds. \u2022 Funding Spread. The\ncost of borrowing defined as the incremental\nspread over the OIS rate for a specific\ncollateral rate (which refers to the rate\napplicable to a specific type of security\npledged as collateral). \u2022 Loss Given Default.\nAmount expressed as a percentage of par that\nis the expected loss when a credit event\noccurs. \u2022 Margin Loan Rate. The annualized\nrate that reflects the possibility of losses\nas a result of movements in the price of the\nunderlying margin loan collateral. The rate is\ncalibrated from the discount rate, credit\nspreads and/or volatility measures. \u2022 WACC.\nWACC represents the theoretical rate of return\nrequired to debt and equity investors. The\nWACC is used in a discounted cash flow model\nthat calculates the value of the equity. The\nmodel assumes that the cash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections, are fully reflected in\nthe current equity value, while the debt to\nequity ratio is held constant. An increase\n(decrease) to the following significant\nunobservable inputs would generally result in\nan impact to the fair value, but the magnitude\nand direction of the impact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is long or short the\nexposure. \u2022 Correlation. A pricing input where\nthe payoff is driven by more than one\nunderlying risk. Correlation is a measure of\nthe relationship between the movement of two\nvariables ( i.e. , how the change in one\nvariable influences a change in the other\nvariable). \u2022 Credit Spread. The credit spread\nreflects the additional net yield an investor\ncan earn from a security with more credit risk\nrelative to one with less credit risk. The\ncredit spread of a particular security is\noften quoted in relation to the yield on a\ncredit risk-free benchmark security or\nreference rate. \u2022 Interest Rate Curve. The\nterm structure of interest rates (relationship\nbetween interest rates and the time to\nmaturity) and a market\u2019s measure of future\ninterest rates at the time of observation. An\ninterest rate curve is used to set interest\nrate and foreign exchange derivative cash\nflows and is a pricing input used in the\ndiscounting of any OTC derivative cash flow. \u2022\nVolatility. The measure of variability in\npossible returns for an instrument given how\nmuch that instrument changes in value over\ntime. Volatility is a pricing input for\noptions, and, generally, the lower the\nvolatility, the less risky the option. The\nlevel of volatility used in the valuation of a\nparticular option depends on a number of\nfactors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying that option, the tenor and the\nstrike price of the option. \u2022 Volatility Skew.\nThe measure of the difference in implied\nvolatility for options with identical\nunderliers and expiry dates but with different\nstrikes.\n                                 \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    98  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNet Asset Value\nMeasurements\nFund Interests\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        Ca\u2026                 Ca\u2026            \n  in       Va\u2026       Co\u2026       Va\u2026       Co\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  638    $  2,\u2026    $  615  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026       2,\u2026       239       2,\u2026       248  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026       190         3       191         2  \n  T\u2026    $  5,\u2026    $  880    $  4,\u2026    $  865  \n                                              \n1. Investments in hedge funds may be subject\nto initial period lock-up or gate provisions,\nwhich restrict an investor from withdrawing\nfrom the fund during a certain initial period\nor restrict the redemption amount on any\nredemption date, respectively.\nAmounts in the\nprevious table\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s\ncarrying value of\ngeneral and limited\npartnership interests\nin fund investments,\nas well as any related\nperformance-based\nincome in the form of\ncarried interest.

Gains and losses for Loans and Other\nassets\u2014Other investments are classified in\nOther revenues. For other items, gains and\nlosses are recorded in Other revenues if the\nitem is held for sale; otherwise, they are\nrecorded in Other expenses.\n2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of\nloans and lending commitments, which exclude\nthe impact of related economic hedges, are\ncalculated as follows: for the held-for-\ninvestment category, based on the value of the\nunderlying collateral; and for the held-for-\nsale category, based on recently executed\ntransactions, market price quotations,\nvaluation models that incorporate market\nobservable inputs where possible, such as\ncomparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread\nlevels adjusted for any basis difference\nbetween cash and derivative instruments, or\ndefault recovery analysis where such\ntransactions and quotations are unobservable.\n3.

A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties for\nthese derivatives are\nbanks, broker-dealers,\nand insurance and\nother financial\ninstitutions.

The Firm\nmanages its exposure\nto these derivative\ncontracts through a\nvariety of risk\nmitigation strategies,\nwhich include managing\nthe credit and\ncorrelation risk\nacross single-name,\nnon-tranched indices\nand baskets, tranched\nindices and baskets,\nand cash positions.\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\nestablished for credit\nderivatives, and\nmarket risk measures\nare routinely\nmonitored against\nthese limits. The Firm\nmay also recover\namounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligation delivered\nto the Firm under CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS\nprotects the buyer\nagainst the loss of\nprincipal on a bond or\nloan in case of a\ndefault by the issuer.\nThe protection buyer\npays a periodic\npremium (generally\nquarterly) over the\nlife of the contract\nand is protected for\nthe period. The Firm,\nin turn, performs\nunder a CDS if a\ncredit event as\ndefined under the\ncontract occurs.\nTypical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay and\nrestructuring of the\nobligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.\nIndex and basket CDS\nare products where\ncredit protection is\nprovided on a\nportfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally,\nin the event of a\ndefault on one of the\nunderlying names, the\nFirm pays a pro rata\nportion of the total\nnotional amount of the\nCDS. The Firm also\nenters into tranched\nindex and basket CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection is provided\non a particular\nportion of the\nportfolio loss\ndistribution. The most\njunior tranches cover\ninitial defaults, and\nonce losses exceed the\nnotional of the\n                                  \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    104  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ntranche, they are\npassed on to the next\nmost senior tranche in\nthe capital structure.\nOther Credit\nContracts.

These\nliabilities are\ngenerally payable from\nthe cash flows of the\nrelated assets, which\nare accounted for as\nTrading assets (see\nNotes 14 and 16).\n                                  \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    108  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n10.

For Corporate,\nSecured lending\nfacilities and Other\nloans, credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the evaluation\nof financial\nstatements, assessment\nof leverage,\nliquidity, capital\nstrength, asset\ncomposition and\nquality, market\ncapitalization and\naccess to capital\nmarkets, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements,\nand the adequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable. The CRM\nalso evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, obligor\u2019s\nmanagement and other\nfactors that could\naffect an obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile.\n\nFor Commercial real\nestate loans, the\ncredit evaluation is\nfocused on property\nand transaction\nmetrics, including\nproperty type, LTV\nratio, occupancy\nlevels, debt service\nratio, prevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\n\nFor Residential real\nestate and Securities-\nbased loans, the\ninitial credit\nevaluation typically\nincludes, but is not\nlimited to, review of\nthe obligor\u2019s income,\nnet worth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand credit bureau\ninformation.\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nresidential real\nestate loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level.\nSecurities-based loan\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis.\nFor information\nrelated to credit\nquality indicators\nconsidered in\ndeveloping the ACL,\nsee Note 2.\n

The\nFirm uses interest\nrate swaps to more\nclosely match these\nborrowings to the\nduration, holding\nperiod and interest\nrate characteristics\nof the assets being\nfunded and to manage\ninterest rate risk.\nThese swaps\neffectively convert\ncertain of the Firm\u2019s\nfixed rate borrowings\ninto floating rate\nobligations. In\naddition, for non-U.S.\ndollar currency\nborrowings that are\nnot used to fund\nassets in the same\ncurrency, the Firm has\nentered into currency\nswaps that effectively\nconvert the borrowings\ninto U.S. dollar\nobligations.

Forward-starting\nsecured financing\nreceivables are\ngenerally settled\nwithin three business\ndays.\nSince commitments\nassociated with these\ninstruments may expire\nunused, the amounts\nshown do not\nnecessarily reflect\nthe actual future cash\nfunding requirements.\n\nTypes of Commitments\n\nLending Commitments.\nLending commitments\nprimarily represent\nthe notional amount of\nlegally binding\nobligations to provide\nfunding to clients for\ndifferent types of\nloan transactions. For\nsyndications that are\nled by the Firm, the\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed are net of the\namounts agreed to by\ncounterparties that\nwill participate in\nthe syndication. For\nsyndications that the\nFirm participates in and does not lead,\nlending commitments accepted by the borrower\nbut not yet closed include only the amount\nthat the Firm expects it will be allocated\nfrom the lead syndicate bank. Due to the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s obligations under the\ncommitments, these amounts include certain\ncommitments participated to third parties.\nForward-Starting Secured Financing\nReceivables. This amount includes securities\npurchased under agreements to resell and\nsecurities borrowed that the Firm has entered\ninto prior to the balance sheet date that will\nsettle after the balance sheet date. These\ntransactions are primarily secured by\ncollateral from U.S. government agency\nsecurities and other sovereign government\nobligations when they are funded. Central\nCounterparty. These commitments relate to the\nFirm\u2019s membership in certain clearinghouses\nand are contingent upon the default of a\nclearinghouse member or other stress events.\nUnderwriting Commitments. The Firm provides\nunderwriting commitments in connection with\nits capital raising sources to a diverse group\nof corporate and other institutional clients.\nInvestment Activities. The Firm sponsors\nseveral non-consolidated investment management\nfunds for third-party investors where it\ntypically acts as general partner of, and\ninvestment advisor to, these funds and\ntypically commits to invest a minority of the\ncapital of such funds, with subscribing third-\nparty investors contributing the majority. The\nFirm has contractual capital commitments,\nguarantees and counterparty arrangements with\nrespect to these investment management funds.\nLetters of Credit and Other Financial\nGuarantees. The Firm has outstanding letters\nof credit and other financial guarantees\nissued by third-party banks to certain of the\nFirm\u2019s counterparties. The Firm is\ncontingently liable for these letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees, which\nare primarily used to provide collateral for\nsecurities and commodities traded and to\nsatisfy various margin requirements in lieu of\ndepositing cash or securities with these\ncounterparties.\n                                  \n  115    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nGuarantees\n                                              \n           At                                 \n         Dec\u2026                                 \n          31,                                 \n         2022                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         Max\u2026                                 \n         Pot\u2026                                 \n         Pay\u2026                           Car\u2026  \n           of                           Amo\u2026  \n         Obl\u2026                           Ass\u2026  \n           by                           (Li\u2026  \n         Yea\u2026                                 \n           to                                 \n         Mat\u2026                                 \n  $      Less                    Ov\u2026          \n  in     than     1-3     3-5      5          \n  mi\u2026       1                                 \n  No\u2026    1,1\u2026    923\u2026    341\u2026    78\u2026    -79\u2026  \n  de\u2026                                         \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  and    1,4\u2026     736    1,2\u2026    2,\u2026       2  \n  ot\u2026                                         \n  fi\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  is\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  va\u2026       2       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Li\u2026    3,2\u2026       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  fa\u2026                                         \n  Wh\u2026                                         \n  lo\u2026       \u2014      24      63    23\u2026       \u2014  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014    78\u2026      -3  \n  and                                         \n  wa\u2026                                         \n  Ge\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026     357      30     143     35     -88  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Cl\u2026                                         \n  cl\u2026      40       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n                                              \n1. The carrying amounts of derivative\ncontracts that meet the accounting definition\nof a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For\nfurther information on derivative contracts,\nsee Note 7.\n2. These amounts include certain issued\nstandby letters of credit participated to\nthird parties, totaling $ 0.6billion of\nnotional and collateral/recourse, due to the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s obligations under these\narrangements. As of December 31, 2022, the\ncarrying amount of standby letters of credit\nand other financial guarantees issued includes\nan allowance for credit losses of $ 79million.\n3. Related to commercial and residential\nmortgage securitizations.\nTypes of Guarantees\nNon-Credit\nDerivatives. Certain\nderivative contracts\nmeet the accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, including\ncertain written\noptions, contingent\nforward contracts and\nCDS (see Note 7\nregarding credit\nderivatives in which\nthe Firm has sold\ncredit protection to\nthe counterparty which\nare excluded from the\nprevious table). For\nnon-credit derivative\ncontracts that meet\nthe accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee the notional\namount is used as the\nmaximum potential\npayout for certain\nderivative contracts,\nsuch as written\ninterest rate caps and\nwritten foreign\ncurrency options. The\nFirm evaluates\ncollateral\nrequirements for all\nderivatives, including\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\naccounting definition\nof a guarantee. For\nthe effects of cash\ncollateral and\ncounterparty netting,\nsee Note 7. In certain\nsituations, collateral\nmay be held by the\nFirm for those\ncontracts that meet\nthe definition of a\nguarantee. Generally,\nthe Firm sets\ncollateral\nrequirements by\ncounterparty so that\nthe collateral covers\nvarious transactions\nand products and is\nnot allocated\nspecifically to\nindividual contracts.\nAlso, the Firm may\nrecover amounts\nrelated to the\nunderlying asset\ndelivered to the Firm\nunder the derivative\ncontract. Standby\nLetters of Credit and\nOther Financial\nGuarantees Issued. In\nconnection with its\ncorporate lending\nbusiness and other\ncorporate activities,\nthe Firm provides\nstandby letters of\ncredit and other\nfinancial guarantees\nto counterparties.\nSuch arrangements\nrepresent obligations\nto make payments to\nthird parties if the\ncounterparty fails to\nfulfill its obligation\nunder a borrowing\narrangement or other\ncontractual\nobligation. A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s standby\nletters of credit are\nprovided on behalf of\ncounterparties that\nare investment grade.\nIf the counterparty\nfails to fulfill its\ncontractual\nobligation, the Firm\nhas access to\ncollateral or recourse\nthat would approximate\nits obligation.\n\nMarket Value\nGuarantees. Market\nvalue guarantees are\nissued to guarantee\ntimely payment of a\nspecified return to\ninvestors in certain\naffordable housing tax\ncredit funds. These\nguarantees are\ndesigned to return an\ninvestor\u2019s\ncontribution to a fund\nand the investor\u2019s\nshare of tax losses\nand tax credits\nexpected to be\ngenerated by a fund.\nLiquidity Facilities.\nThe Firm has entered\ninto liquidity\nfacilities with SPEs\nand other\ncounterparties,\nwhereby the Firm is\nrequired to make\ncertain payments if\nlosses or defaults\noccur. Primarily, the\nFirm acts as liquidity\nprovider to municipal\nbond securitization\nSPEs and for\nstandalone municipal\nbonds in which the\nholders of beneficial\ninterests issued by\nthese SPEs or the\nholders of the\nindividual bonds,\nrespectively, have the\nright to tender their\ninterests for purchase\nby the Firm on\nspecified dates at a\nspecified price. The\nFirm often may have\nrecourse to the\nunderlying assets held\nby the SPEs in the\nevent payments are\nrequired under such\nliquidity facilities,\nas well as make-whole\nor recourse provisions\nwith the trust\nsponsors. The recourse\namount often exceeds\nthe maximum potential\npayout amount of the\nguarantee.\nSubstantially all of\nthe underlying assets\nin the SPEs are\ninvestment grade.\nLiquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal\ntender option bond\ntrusts are classified\nas derivatives. Whole\nLoan Sales Guarantees.\nThe Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to\nbe responsible for,\nrepresentations and\nwarranties regarding\ncertain whole loan\nsales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the\nFirm may be required\nto repurchase such\nassets or make other\npayments related to\nsuch assets if such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties are\nbreached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential\npayout related to such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties is equal to\nthe current UPB of\nsuch loans. Since the\nFirm no longer\nservices these loans,\nit has no information\non the current UPB of\nthose loans, and,\naccordingly, the\namount included in the\nprevious table\nrepresents the UPB at\nthe time of the whole\nloan sale or at the\ntime when the Firm\nlast serviced any of\nthose loans. The\ncurrent UPB balances\ncould be substantially\nlower than the maximum\npotential payout\namount included in the\nprevious table. The\nrelated liability\nprimarily relates to\nsales of loans to the\nfederal mortgage\nagencies.\nSecuritization\nRepresentations and\nWarranties. As part of\nthe Firm\u2019s\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment\u2019s\nsecuritizations and\nrelated activities,\nthe Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to\nbe responsible for,\nrepresentations and\nwarranties regarding\ncertain assets\ntransferred in\nsecuritization\ntransactions sponsored\nby the Firm. The\nextent and nature of\nthe representations\nand warranties, if\nany, vary among\ndifferent\nsecuritizations. Under\ncertain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be\nrequired to repurchase\ncertain assets or make\nother payments related\nto such assets if such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties are\nbreached. The maximum\npotential amount of\nfuture payments the\nFirm could be required\nto make would be equal\nto the current\noutstanding balances\nof, or losses\nassociated with, the\nassets subject to\nbreaches of such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. The amount\nincluded in the\n                                  \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    116  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nprevious table for the maximum potential\npayout includes the current UPB or historical\nlosses where known and the UPB at the time of\nsale when the current UPB is not known.\nGeneral Partner Guarantees. As a general\npartner in certain investment management\nfunds, the Firm receives certain distributions\nfrom the partnerships when the return exceeds\nspecified performance targets according to the\nprovisions of the partnership agreements. The\nFirm may be required to return all or a\nportion of such distributions to the limited\npartners in the event the limited partners do\nnot achieve a certain return as specified in\nthe various partnership agreements, subject to\ncertain limitations. Client Clearing\nGuarantees. The Firm is a sponsoring member of\nthe Government Securities Division of the\nFICC's Sponsored Clearing Model. Clients of\nthe Firm, as sponsored members, can transact\nin overnight and term securities repurchase\nand resale agreements, which are cleared\nthrough the FICC. As sponsoring member, the\nFirm guarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its clients\u2019\nobligations. In 2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored\nclearing model was updated such that the Firm\ncould be responsible for liquidation of a\nsponsored member\u2019s account and guarantees any\nresulting loss to the FICC in the event the\nsponsored member fails to fully pay any net\nliquidation amount due from the sponsored\nmember to the FICC. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential payout amount reflects the\ntotal of the estimated net liquidation amounts\nfor sponsored member accounts. The Firm\nminimizes credit exposure under this guarantee\nby obtaining a security interest in its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member\ntransactions. Therefore, the Firm's exposure\nis estimated to be an amount substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout\namount. The collateral amount in which the\nFirm has a security interest is approximately\nequal to the maximum potential payout amount\nof the guarantee. Other Guarantees and\nIndemnities In the normal course of business,\nthe Firm provides guarantees and\nindemnifications in a variety of transactions.\nThese provisions generally are standard\ncontractual terms. Certain of these guarantees\nand indemnifications are described below: \u2022\nIndemnities . The Firm provides standard\nindemnities to counterparties for certain\ncontingent exposures and taxes, including U.S.\nand foreign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities\nand stock lending transactions, certain\nannuity products and other financial\narrangements. These indemnity payments could\nbe required based on a change in the tax laws,\na change in interpretation of applicable tax\nrulings or a change in factual circumstances.\nCertain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The Firm\nmay also provide indemnities when it sells a\nbusiness or assets to a third-party, pursuant\nto which it indemnifies the third-party for\nlosses incurred on assets acquired or\nliabilities assumed or due to actions taken by\nthe Firm prior to the sale of the business or\nassets. The Firm expects the risk of loss\nassociated with indemnities related to the\nsale of businesses or assets to be remote. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Firm could be required to make under\nthese indemnifications cannot be estimated. \u2022\nExchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The\nFirm is a member of various exchanges and\nclearinghouses that trade and clear securities\nand/or derivative contracts. Associated with\nits membership, the Firm may be required to\npay a certain amount as determined by the\nexchange or the clearinghouse in case of a\ndefault of any of its members or pay a\nproportionate share of the financial\nobligations of another member that may default\non its obligations to the exchange or the\nclearinghouse. While the rules governing\ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse\nmemberships and the forms of these guarantees\nmay vary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder these rules would arise only if the\nexchange or clearinghouse had previously\nexhausted its resources. In addition, some\nclearinghouse rules require members to assume\na proportionate share of losses resulting from\nthe clearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee\nfund contributions and initial margin and of\nother losses unrelated to the default of a\nclearing member, if such losses exceed the\nspecified resources allocated for such purpose\nby the clearinghouse. The maximum potential\npayout under these rules cannot be estimated.\nThe Firm has not recorded any contingent\nliability in its financial statements for\nthese agreements and believes that any\npotential requirement to make payments under\nthese agreements is remote. \u2022 Merger and\nAcquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from\ntime to time, in its role as investment\nbanking advisor be required to provide\nguarantees in connection with certain European\nmerger and acquisition transactions. If\nrequired by the regulating authorities, the\nFirm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in\nthe transaction has or will have sufficient\nfunds to complete the transaction and would\nthen be required to make the acquisition\npayments in the event the acquirer\u2019s funds are\ninsufficient at the completion date of the\ntransaction. These arrangements generally\ncover the time frame from the transaction\noffer date to its closing date and, therefore,\nare generally short term in nature. The Firm\nbelieves the likelihood of any payment by the\nFirm under these arrangements is remote given\nthe level of its due diligence in its role as\ninvestment banking advisor. In addition, in\nthe ordinary course of business, the Firm\nguarantees the debt and/or certain trading\nobligations (including obligations associated\nwith derivatives, foreign exchange contracts\nand the settlement of physical commodities) of\ncertain subsidiaries. These guarantees\n                                  \n  117    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ngenerally are entity\nor product specific\nand are required by\ninvestors or trading\ncounterparties. The\nactivities of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries\ncovered by these\nguarantees (including\nany related debt or\ntrading obligations)\nare included in the\nfinancial statements.\nFinance Subsidiary The\nParent Company fully\nand unconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nMorgan Stanley Finance\nLLC, a wholly owned\nfinance subsidiary. No\nother subsidiary of\nthe Parent Company\nguarantees these\nsecurities.\nContingencies Legal In\naddition to the matter\ndescribed below, in\nthe normal course of\nbusiness, the Firm has\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with its\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress. These\nactions have included,\nbut are not limited\nto, antitrust claims,\nclaims under various\nfalse claims act\nstatutes, and matters\narising from our sales\nand trading\nbusinesses, and our\nactivities in the\ncapital markets. The\nFirm is also involved,\nfrom time to time, in\nother reviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding the\nFirm\u2019s business, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\ntrading, financing,\nprime brokerage,\nmarket-making\nactivities, investment\nbanking advisory\nservices, capital\nmarket activities,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, wealth\nand investment\nmanagement services,\nand accounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief. While\nthe Firm has\nidentified below any\nindividual proceedings\nor investigations\nwhere the Firm\nbelieves a material\nloss to be reasonably\npossible and\nreasonably estimable,\nthere can be no\nassurance that\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nthose where potential\nlosses have not yet\nbeen determined to be\nprobable or possible\nand reasonably\nestimable. The Firm\ncontests liability\nand/or the amount of\ndamages as appropriate\nin each pending\nmatter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions        2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Legal        $   443    $   157    $   336  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s legal\nexpenses can, and may\nin the future,\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm. In many\nproceedings and\ninvestigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss, or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss, can be\nreasonably estimated\nfor a proceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. For certain\nother legal\nproceedings and\ninvestigations, the\nFirm can estimate\nreasonably possible\nlosses, additional\nlosses, ranges of loss\nor ranges of\nadditional loss in\nexcess of amounts\naccrued but does not\nbelieve, based on\ncurrent knowledge and\nafter consultation\nwith counsel, that\nsuch losses could have\na material adverse\neffect on the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements\nas a whole, other than\nthe matter referred to\nin the following\nparagraph. Tax In\nmatters styled Case\nnumber 15/3637 and\nCase number 15/4353 ,\nthe Dutch Tax\nAuthority (\u201cDutch\nAuthority\u201d) is\nchallenging in the\nDutch courts the prior\nset-off by the Firm of\napproximately \u20ac\n124million\n(approximately $\n133million) plus\naccrued interest of\nwithholding tax\ncredits against the\nFirm\u2019s corporation tax\nliabilities for the\ntax years 2007 to\n2012. The Dutch\nAuthority alleges that\nthe Firm was not\nentitled to receive\nthe withholding tax\ncredits on the basis,\ninter alia, that a\nFirm subsidiary did\nnot hold legal title\nto certain securities\nsubject to withholding\ntax on the relevant\ndates. The Dutch\nAuthority has also\nalleged that the Firm\nfailed to provide\ncertain information to\nthe Dutch Authority\nand to keep adequate\nbooks and records. On\nApril 26, 2018, the\nDistrict Court in\nAmsterdam issued a\ndecision dismissing\nthe Dutch Authority\u2019s\nclaims with respect to\ncertain of the tax\nyears in dispute. On\nMay 12, 2020, the\nCourt of Appeal in\nAmsterdam granted the\nDutch Authority\u2019s\nappeal in matters re-\nstyled Case number\n18/00318 and Case\nnumber 18/00319 . On\nJune 22, 2020, the\nFirm filed an appeal\nagainst the\n                                  \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    118  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ndecision of the Court\nof Appeal in Amsterdam\nbefore the Dutch High\nCourt. On January 29,\n2021, the Advocate\nGeneral of the Dutch\nHigh Court issued an\nadvisory opinion on\nthe Firm\u2019s appeal,\nwhich rejected the\nFirm\u2019s principal\ngrounds of appeal. On\nFebruary 11, 2021, the\nFirm and the Dutch\nAuthority each\nresponded to this\nopinion. On June 22,\n2021, Dutch criminal\nauthorities sought\nvarious documents in\nconnection with an\ninvestigation of the\nFirm related to the\ncivil claims asserted\nby the Dutch Authority\nconcerning the\naccuracy of the Firm\nsubsidiary\u2019s tax\nreturns and the\nmaintenance of its\nbooks and records for\n2007 to 2012.\n\n16. Variable Interest\nEntities and\nSecuritization\nActivities\nOverview The Firm is\ninvolved with various\nSPEs in the normal\ncourse of business. In\nmost cases, these\nentities are deemed to\nbe VIEs. The Firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in\nVIEs include debt and\nequity interests,\ncommitments,\nguarantees, derivative\ninstruments and\ncertain fees. The\nFirm\u2019s involvement\nwith VIEs arises\nprimarily from: \u2022\nInterests purchased in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities, securities\nheld in its Investment\nsecurities portfolio\nand retained interests\nheld as a result of\nsecuritization\nactivities, including\nre-securitization\ntransactions. \u2022\nGuarantees issued and\nresidual interests\nretained in connection\nwith municipal bond\nsecuritizations. \u2022\nLoans made to and\ninvestments in VIEs\nthat hold debt,\nequity, real estate or\nother assets. \u2022\nDerivatives entered\ninto with VIEs. \u2022\nStructuring of CLNs or\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes\ndesigned to meet the\ninvestment objectives\nof clients. \u2022 Other\nstructured\ntransactions designed\nto provide tax-\nefficient yields to\nthe Firm or its\nclients. The Firm\ndetermines whether it\nis the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE\nupon its initial\ninvolvement with the\nVIE and reassesses\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary on\nan ongoing basis as\nlong as it has any\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the VIE. This\ndetermination is based\nupon an analysis of\nthe design of the VIE,\nincluding the VIE\u2019s\nstructure and\nactivities, the power\nto make significant\neconomic decisions\nheld by the Firm and\nby other parties, and\nthe variable interests\nowned by the Firm and\nother parties. The\npower to make the most\nsignificant economic\ndecisions may take a\nnumber of different\nforms in different\ntypes of VIEs. The\nFirm considers\nservicing or\ncollateral management\ndecisions as\nrepresenting the power\nto make the most\nsignificant economic\ndecisions in\ntransactions such as\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs. As a result, the\nFirm does not\nconsolidate\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs for which it does\nnot act as the\nservicer or collateral\nmanager unless it\nholds certain\n\nother rights to\nreplace the servicer\nor collateral manager\nor to require the\nliquidation of the\nentity. If the Firm\nserves as servicer or\ncollateral manager, or\nhas certain other\nrights described in\nthe previous sentence,\nthe Firm analyzes the\ninterests in the VIE\nthat it holds and\nconsolidates only\nthose VIEs for which\nit holds a potentially\nsignificant interest\nin the VIE. For many\ntransactions, such as\nre-securitization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes,\nthere are no\nsignificant economic\ndecisions made on an\nongoing basis. In\nthese cases, the Firm\nfocuses its analysis\non decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing of the\ntransaction and at the\ntermination of the\ntransaction. The Firm\nconcluded in most of\nthese transactions\nthat decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing were shared\nbetween the Firm and\nthe initial investors\nbased upon the nature\nof the assets,\nincluding whether the\nassets were issued in\na transaction\nsponsored by the Firm\nand the extent of the\ninformation available\nto the Firm and to\ninvestors, the number,\nnature and involvement\nof investors, other\nrights held by the\nFirm and investors,\nthe standardization of\nthe legal\ndocumentation and the\nlevel of continuing\ninvolvement by the\nFirm, including the\namount and type of\ninterests owned by the\nFirm and by other\ninvestors. The Firm\nfocused its control\ndecision on any right\nheld by the Firm or\ninvestors related to\nthe termination of the\nVIE. Most re-\nsecuritization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes have\nno such termination\nrights.\n                                  \n  119    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nConsolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by\nType of Activity\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        VIE       VIE       VIE       VIE  \n  in       As\u2026       Li\u2026       As\u2026       Li\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  520    $  1,\u2026    $  409  \n  I\u2026       638       272       717       294  \n  v\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026         1         \u2014       508        39  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       889       521       510       286  \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n                                              \n1.

Investment\nSecurities The Firm\nholds securities\nissued by VIEs within\nthe Investment\nsecurities portfolio.\nThese securities are\ncomposed of those\nrelated to\ntransactions sponsored\nby the federal\nmortgage agencies and\npredominantly the most\nsenior\n\nsecurities issued by\nVIEs backed by student\nloans and commercial\nmortgage loans.\nTransactions sponsored\nby the federal\nmortgage agencies\ninclude an explicit or\nimplicit guarantee\nprovided by the U.S.\ngovernment.\nAdditionally, the Firm\nholds certain\ncommercial mortgage-\nbacked securities\nissued by VIEs\nretained as a result\nof the Firm's\nsecuritization\nactivities. See Note 8\nfor further\ninformation on the\nInvestment securities\nportfolio. Municipal\nTender Option Bond\nTrusts In a municipal\ntender option bond\ntrust transaction, the\nclient transfers a\nmunicipal bond to a\ntrust. The trust\nissues short-term\nsecurities that the\nFirm, as the\nremarketing agent,\nsells to investors.\nThe client generally\nretains a residual\ninterest. The short-\nterm securities are\nsupported by a\nliquidity facility\npursuant to which the\ninvestors may put\ntheir short-term\ninterests. In most\nprograms, a third-\nparty provider will\nprovide such liquidity\nfacility; in some\nprograms, the Firm\nprovides this\nliquidity facility.\nThe Firm may, in lieu\nof purchasing short-\nterm securities for\nremarketing, decide to\nextend a temporary\nloan to the trust. The\nclient can generally\nterminate the\ntransaction at any\ntime. The liquidity\nprovider can generally\nterminate the\ntransaction upon the\noccurrence of certain\nevents. When the\ntransaction is\nterminated, the\nmunicipal bond is\ngenerally sold or\nreturned to the\nclient. Any losses\nsuffered by the\nliquidity provider\nupon the sale of the\nbond are the\nresponsibility of the\nclient. This\nobligation is\ngenerally\ncollateralized.\nLiquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal\ntender option bond\ntrusts are classified\nas derivatives. The\nFirm consolidates any\nmunicipal tender\noption bond trusts in\nwhich it holds the\nresidual interest.\nCredit Protection\nPurchased through\nCredit-Linked Notes\nCLN transactions are\ndesigned to provide\ninvestors with\nexposure to certain\ncredit risk on\nreferenced assets. In\nthese transactions,\nthe Firm transfers\nassets (generally\nhigh-quality\nsecurities or money\nmarket investments) to\nan SPE, enters into a\nderivative transaction\nin which the SPE sells\nprotection on an\nunrelated referenced\nasset or group of\nassets, through a\ncredit derivative, and\nsells the securities\nissued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some\ntransactions, the Firm\nmay also enter into\ninterest rate or\ncurrency swaps with\nthe SPE. Depending on\nthe structure, the\nassets and liabilities\nof the SPE may be\nconsolidated and\nrecognized in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet\nor accounted for as a\nsale of assets. Upon\nthe occurrence of a\ncredit event related\nto the referenced\nasset, the SPE will\ndeliver securities\ncollateral as payment\nto the Firm, which\nexposes the Firm to\nchanges in the\ncollateral\u2019s value.\nDerivative payments by\nthe SPE are\ncollateralized. The\nrisks associated with\nthese and similar\nderivatives with SPEs\nare essentially the\nsame as those with\nnon-SPE counterparties\nand are managed as\npart of the Firm\u2019s\noverall exposure.\n                                  \n  121    December 2022 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nOther Structured\nFinancings The Firm\ninvests in interests\nissued by entities\nthat develop and own\nlow-income communities\n(including low-income\nhousing projects) and\nentities that\nconstruct and own\nfacilities that will\ngenerate energy from\nrenewable resources.\nThe interests entitle\nthe Firm to a share of\ntax credits and tax\nlosses generated by\nthese projects. In\naddition, the Firm has\nissued guarantees to\ninvestors in certain\nlow-income housing\nfunds. The guarantees\nare designed to return\nan investor\u2019s\ncontribution to a fund\nand the investor\u2019s\nshare of tax losses\nand tax credits\nexpected to be\ngenerated by the fund.\nThe Firm is also\ninvolved with entities\ndesigned to provide\ntax-efficient yields\nto the Firm or its\nclients.\nCollateralized Loan\nand Debt Obligations\nCLOs and CDOs are SPEs\nthat purchase a pool\nof assets consisting\nof corporate loans,\ncorporate bonds, ABS\nor synthetic exposures\non similar assets\nthrough derivatives\nand issue multiple\ntranches of debt and\nequity securities to\ninvestors. The Firm\nunderwrites the\nsecurities issued in\ncertain CLO\ntransactions on behalf\nof unaffiliated\nsponsors and provides\nadvisory services to\nthese unaffiliated\nsponsors. The Firm\nsells corporate loans\nto many of these SPEs,\nin some cases\nrepresenting a\nsignificant portion of\nthe total assets\npurchased. Although\nnot obligated, the\nFirm generally makes a\nmarket in the\nsecurities issued by\nSPEs in these\ntransactions and may\nretain unsold\nsecurities. These\nbeneficial interests\nare included in\nTrading assets and are\nmeasured at fair\nvalue. Equity-Linked\nNotes ELN transactions\nare designed to\nprovide investors with\nexposure to certain\nrisks related to the\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index. In an\nELN transaction, the\nFirm typically\ntransfers to an SPE\neither a note issued\nby the Firm, the\npayments on which are\nlinked to the\nperformance of a\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index, or\ndebt securities issued\nby other companies and\na derivative contract,\nthe terms of which\nwill relate to the\nperformance of a\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index.

Regulatory Requirements Regulatory Capital\nFramework The Firm is an FHC under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and\nis subject to the regulation and oversight of\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal\nReserve establishes capital requirements for\nthe Firm, including \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance\nwith such capital requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries, including, among others, MSBNA\nand MSPBNA (together, \u201cU.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries\u201d). The regulatory capital\nrequirements are largely based on the Basel\nIII capital standards established by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision and also\nimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct. In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s regulated\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital\nrequirements, including regulated subsidiaries\nprovisionally registered as swap dealers with\nthe CFTC or conditionally registered as\nsecurity-based swap dealers with the SEC or\nregistered as broker-dealers or futures\ncommission merchants. Regulatory Capital\nRequirements The Firm is required to maintain\nminimum risk-based and leverage-based capital\nratios under regulatory capital requirements.\nA summary of the calculations of regulatory\ncapital and RWA follows. Risk-Based Regulatory\nCapital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements\napply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital (which includes Tier\n2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and\nconsist of regulatory minimum required ratios\nplus the Firm\u2019s capital buffer requirement.\nCapital requirements require certain\nadjustments to, and deductions from, capital\nfor purposes of determining these ratios. CECL\nDeferral.

The U.S.\nQualified Plan assets\nrepresent 88% and 86%\nof the Firm\u2019s total\npension plan assets at\nDecember 31, 2022 and\nDecember 2021,\nrespectively. The U.S.\nQualified Plan uses a\ncombination of active\nand risk-controlled\nfixed income\ninvestment strategies.\nThe fixed income asset\nallocation consists\nprimarily of fixed\nincome securities and\nrelated derivative\ninstruments designed\nto approximate the\nexpected cash flows of\nthe plan\u2019s liabilities\nto help reduce plan\nexposure to interest\nrate variation and to\nbetter align assets\nwith the obligation.\nThe longer-duration\nfixed income\nallocation is expected\nto help protect the\nplan\u2019s funded status\nand maintain the\nstability of plan\ncontributions over the\nlong run. The\ninvestment portfolio\nperformance is\nassessed by comparing\nactual investment\nperformance with\nchanges in the\nestimated present\nvalue of the U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nbenefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments\nare permitted in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio\nonly to the extent\nthat they comply with\nall of the plan\u2019s\ninvestment policy\nguidelines and are\nconsistent with the\nplan\u2019s risk and return\nobjectives. As a\nfundamental operating\nprinciple, any\nrestrictions on the\nunderlying assets\napply to the\nrespective derivative\nproduct. This includes\npercentage allocations\nand credit quality.\nDerivatives are used\nsolely for the purpose\nof enhancing\n                                  \n  December 2022 Form 10-K    132  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ninvestment returns in\nthe underlying assets\nand not to circumvent\nportfolio\nrestrictions. Plan\nassets are measured at\nfair value using\nvaluation techniques\nthat are consistent\nwith the valuation\ntechniques applied to\nthe Firm\u2019s major\ncategories of assets\nand liabilities as\ndescribed in Notes 2\nand 5. OTC derivative\ncontracts consist of\ninvestments in\ninterest rate swaps\nand total return\nswaps. Other\ninvestments consist of\ninsurance contracts\nheld by non-U.S.-based\nplans. The insurance\ncontracts are valued\nbased on the premium\nreserve of the insurer\nfor a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given\nto the employee\nbenefit plan that\napproximates fair\nvalue. The insurance\ncontracts are\ncategorized in Level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nprivately offered\nfunds regulated,\nsupervised and subject\nto periodic\nexamination by a U.S.\nfederal or state\nagency and available\nto institutional\nclients. The trust\nmust be maintained for\nthe collective\ninvestment or\nreinvestment of assets\ncontributed to it from\nU.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans\nmaintained by more\nthan one employer or\ncontrolled group of\ncorporations. The\nsponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds\nvalues the funds based\non the fair value of\nthe underlying\nsecurities. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nredeemable at NAV at\nthe measurement date\nor in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based\nplans hold foreign\nfunds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed\nincome funds, target\ncash flow funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed\nincome funds invest in\nindividual securities\nquoted on a recognized\nstock exchange or\ntraded in a regulated\nmarket. Certain fixed\nincome funds aim to\nproduce returns\nconsistent with\ncertain Financial\nTimes Stock Exchange\nindexes.

In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress. These\nactions include, but\nare not limited to,\nantitrust claims,\nclaims under various\nfalse claims act\nstatutes, and matters\narising from our sales\nand trading\nbusinesses, and our\nactivities in the\ncapital markets.\n\nThe Firm is also\ninvolved, from time to\ntime, in other\nreviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby\n\ngovernmental and self-\nregulatory agencies\nregarding the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\ntrading, financing,\nprime brokerage,\nmarket-making\nactivities, investment\nbanking advisory\nservices, capital\nmarket activities,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, wealth\nand investment\nmanagement services,\nand accounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief.\n\nThe Firm contests\nliability and/or the\namount of damages as\nappropriate in each\npending matter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\nThe Firm\u2019s legal\nexpenses can, and may\nin future, fluctuate\nfrom period to period,\ngiven the current\nenvironment regarding\ngovernment\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. The Firm\ncannot predict with\ncertainty if, how or\nwhen such proceedings\nor investigations will\nbe resolved or what\nthe eventual\nsettlement, fine,\npenalty or other\nrelief, if any, may\nbe, particularly for\nproceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. Subject to\nthe foregoing, the\nFirm believes, based\non current knowledge\nand after consultation\nwith counsel, that the\noutcome of such\nproceedings and\ninvestigations will\nnot have a material\nadverse effect on the\nfinancial condition of\nthe Firm, although the\noutcome of such\nproceedings or\ninvestigations could\nbe material to the\nFirm\u2019s operating\nresults and cash flows\nfor a particular\nperiod depending on,\namong other things,\nthe level of the\nFirm\u2019s revenues or\nincome for such\nperiod.\n\nWhile the Firm has\nidentified below\ncertain proceedings or\ninvestigations that\nthe Firm believes to\nbe material,\nindividually or\ncollectively, there\ncan be no assurance\nthat additional\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nare not yet determined\nto be material.
