We compete in the\nU.S. and globally for\nclients, market share\nand human talent.\nOperating within the\nfinancial services\nindustry on a global\nbasis presents, among\nother things,\ntechnological, risk\nmanagement,\nregulatory,\ninfrastructure and\nother challenges that\nrequire effective\nresource allocation in\norder for us to remain\ncompetitive. Our\ncompetitive position\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including our\nreputation, client\nexperience, the\nquality and\nconsistency of our\nlong-term investment\nperformance,\ninnovation, execution,\nrelative pricing and\nother factors,\nincluding entering\ninto new or expanding\ncurrent businesses as\na result of\nacquisitions and other\nstrategic initiatives.\nOur ability to sustain\nor improve our\ncompetitive\n\nposition also depends\nsubstantially on our\nability to continue to\nattract and retain\nhighly qualified\nemployees while\nmanaging compensation\nand other costs. We\ncompete with\ncommercial banks,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, brokerage\nfirms, insurance\ncompanies, exchanges,\nelectronic trading and\nclearing platforms,\nfinancial data\nrepositories,\ninvestment advisers\nand sponsors of mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nreal assets funds and\nprivate credit and\nequity funds, energy\ncompanies, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial and\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally,\nincluding, in certain\ninstances, through the\ninternet. In addition,\nrestrictive laws and\nregulations applicable\nto certain global\nfinancial services\ninstitutions, which\nhave been increasing\nin complexity and\nvolume, may prohibit\nus from engaging in\ncertain transactions,\nimpose more stringent\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, and\nincrease costs, and\ncan put us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage to\ncompetitors in certain\nbusinesses not subject\nto these same\nrequirements. See also\n\u201cSupervision and\nRegulation\u201d herein and\n\u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\nWe compete directly in\nthe U.S. and globally\nwith other securities\nand financial services\nfirms and broker-\ndealers and with\nothers on a regional\nor product basis.\nAdditionally, there is\nincreased competition\ndriven by established\nfirms and asset\nmanagers, as well as\nthe emergence of new\nfirms, non-financial\ncompanies and business\nmodels, including\ninnovative uses of\ntechnology, competing\nfor the same clients\nand assets, or\noffering similar\nproducts and service s\nto retail and\ninstitutional\ncustomers. We also\ncompete with companies\nthat provide online\ntrading and banking\nservices, investment\nadvisory services,\nrobo-advice\ncapabilities, access\nto digital asset\ncapabilities and\nservices, and other\nfinancial products and\nservices.\n\nOur ability to access\ncapital at competitive\nrates (which is\ngenerally impacted by,\namong other things,\nour credit spreads and\nratings) and to commit\nand deploy capital\nefficiently,\nparticularly in our\nmore capital-intensive\nbusinesses, including\nunderwriting and\nsales, trading,\nfinancing and market-\nmaking activities,\nalso affects our\ncompetitive position.\nWe expect clients to\ncontinue to request\nthat we provide loans\nor lending commitments\nin connection with\ncertain investment\nbanking activities.\n\nIt is possible that\ncompetition may become\neven more intense as\nwe continue to compete\nwith financial or\nother institutions\nthat may be larger, or\nbetter capitalized, or\nmay have a stronger\nlocal presence and\nlonger operating\nhistory in certain\ngeographies or\nproducts. Many of\nthese firms have the\nability to offer a\nwide range of products\nand services through\ndifferent platforms\nthat may enhance their\ncompetitive position\nand could result in\nadditional pricing\npressure on our\nbusinesses.\n\nWe continue to\nexperience price\ncompetition in some of\nour businesses. In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities\nand other automated\ntrading platforms, and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\n                                \n  5    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntechnologies will\nlikely continue the\npressure on our\nrevenues.

We\nhave experienced and\nwill likely continue\nto experience\ncompetitive pressures\nin these and other\nareas in the future.\n\nOur ability to compete\nsuccessfully in the\ninvestment management\nindustry is affected\nby several factors,\nincluding our\nreputation, quality of\ninvestment\nprofessionals,\nperformance of\ninvestment strategies\nor product offerings\nrelative to peers and\nappropriate benchmark\nindices, advertising\nand sales promotion\nefforts, fee levels,\nthe effectiveness of\nand access to\ndistribution channels\nand investment\npipelines, the types\nof products offered,\nand regulatory\nrestrictions specific\nto FHCs. Our\ninvestment products,\nincluding alternative\ninvestment products,\nmay compete with\ninvestments offered by\nother investment\nmanagers, including by\ninvestment managers\nwho may be subject to\nless stringent legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan us.\n                                              \n  Supervision and Regulation                  \n                                              \nAs a major financial\nservices firm, we are\nsubject to extensive\nregulation by U.S.\nfederal and state\nregulatory agencies\nand securities\nexchanges and by\nregulators and\nexchanges in each of\nthe major markets\nwhere we conduct our\nbusiness.\n\nWe continue to monitor\nthe changing\npolitical, tax and\nregulatory\nenvironment. While it\nis likely that there\nwill be changes in the\nway major financial\ninstitutions are\nregulated in both the\nU.S. and other markets\nin which we operate,\nit remains difficult\nto predict the exact\nimpact these changes\nwill have on our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, results of\noperations and cash\nflows for a particular\nfuture period. We\nexpect to remain\nsubject to extensive\nsupervision and\nregulation.\n                                              \n   Financial Holding Company                  \n                                              \nConsolidated\nSupervision.

In\nparticular, we are\nsubject to (among\nother things):\nsignificant regulation\nand supervision;\nintensive scrutiny of\nour businesses and\nplans for expansion of\nthose businesses;\nlimitations on\nactivities; a systemic\nrisk regime that\nimposes heightened\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements;\nrestrictions on\nactivities and\ninvestments imposed by\na section of the BHC\nAct added by the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) referred\nto as the \u201cVolcker\nRule,\u201d and\ncomprehensive\nderivatives\nregulation.

The BHC\nAct limits the\nactivities of BHCs and\nFHCs and grants the\nFederal Reserve\nauthority to limit our\nability to conduct\nactivities. We must\nobtain the Federal\nReserve\u2019s approval\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both in the\nU.S. and\ninternationally.\n\nThe BHC Act\ngrandfathers\n\u201cactivities related to\nthe trading, sale or\ninvestment in\ncommodities and\nunderlying physical\nproperties,\u201d provided\nthat we were engaged\nin \u201cany of such\nactivities as of\nSeptember 30, 1997 in\nthe U.S.\u201d and provided\nthat certain other\nconditions that are\nwithin our reasonable\ncontrol are satisfied.\nWe currently engage in\nour commodities\nactivities pursuant to\nthe BHC Act\ngrandfather exemption,\nas well as other\nauthorities under the\nBHC Act.\n\nActivities\nRestrictions under the\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\nbanking entities,\nincluding us and our\naffiliates, from\nengaging in certain\nproprietary trading\nactivities, as defined\nin the Volcker Rule,\nsubject to exemptions\nfor underwriting,\nmarket-making, risk-\nmitigating hedging and\ncertain other\nactivities. The\nVolcker Rule also\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule, subject to a\nnumber of exemptions\nand exclusions.\n\nCapital Requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve\nestablishes capital\nrequirements largely\nbased on the Basel III\ncapital standards\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nincluding well-\ncapitalized standards,\nfor large BHCs and\nevaluates our\ncompliance with such\nrequirements. The\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cOCC\u201d)\nestablishes similar\ncapital requirements\nand standards for\nMorgan Stanley Bank,\nN.A.

In\naddition to capital\nregulations, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have\nadopted liquidity and\nfunding standards,\nincluding the LCR, the\nNSFR, liquidity stress\ntesting and associated\nliquidity reserve\nrequirements.\n\nFor more information,\nsee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Balance\nSheet\u2014Regulatory\nLiquidity Framework.\u201d\n\nSystemic Risk Regime.\nUnder rules issued by\nthe Federal Reserve,\nlarge BHCs, including\nMorgan Stanley, must\nconduct internal\nliquidity stress\ntests, maintain\nunencumbered highly\nliquid assets to meet\nprojected net cash\noutflows for 30 days\nover the range of\nliquidity stress\nscenarios used in\ninternal stress tests,\nand comply with\nvarious liquidity risk\nmanagement\nrequirements. These\nlarge BHCs also must\ncomply with a range of\nrisk management and\ncorporate governance\nrequirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nalso imposes single-\ncounterparty credit\nlimits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for\nlarge banking\norganizations. U.S.\nGlobal systemically\nimportant banks\n(\u201cG-SIBs\u201d), including\nus, are subject to a\nlimit of 15% of Tier 1\ncapital for aggregate\nnet credit exposures\nto any \u201cmajor\ncounterparty\u201d (defined\nto include other U.S.\nG-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs\nand non-bank\n\nsystemically important\nfinancial institutions\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve). In\naddition, we are\nsubject to a limit of\n25% of Tier 1 capital\nfor aggregate net\ncredit exposures to\nany other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nmay establish\nadditional prudential\nstandards for large\nBHCs, including with\nrespect to an early\nremediation framework,\ncontingent capital,\nenhanced public\ndisclosures and limits\non short-term debt,\nincluding off-balance\nsheet exposures.

We\nare required to submit\nonce every two years\nto the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC a\nresolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy\nfor a rapid and\norderly resolution\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Interim\nupdates are required\nin certain limited\ncircumstances,\nincluding material\nmergers or\nacquisitions or\nfundamental changes to\nour resolution\nstrategy.\n\nOur preferred\nresolution strategy,\nwhich is set out in\nour most recent\nresolution plan, is an\nSPOE strategy, which\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy after the\nParent Company has\nfiled for bankruptcy.\n\nOur next resolution\nplan is due July 1,\n2025. Further, we\nsubmit an annual\nrecovery plan to the\nFederal Reserve that\noutlines the steps\nthat management could\ntake over time to\ngenerate or conserve\nfinancial resources in\ntimes of prolonged\nfinancial stress.\n\nCertain of our\ndomestic and foreign\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution\nand recovery planning\nrequirements in the\njurisdictions in which\nthey operate. For\nexample, the FDIC\ncurrently requires\ncertain insured\ndepository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries, to\nsubmit a resolution\nplan every three years\nthat describes the\nIDI\u2019s strategy for a\nrapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure of the IDI.\n\nIn addition, certain\nfinancial companies,\nincluding BHCs such as\nthe Firm and certain\nof its subsidiaries,\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority,\n                                \n  7    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nwith the FDIC being\nappointed as receiver,\nprovided that\ndetermination of\nextraordinary\nfinancial distress and\nsystemic risk is made\nby the U.S. Treasury\nSecretary in\nconsultation with the\nU.S. President.\nRegulators have\nadopted certain\norderly liquidation\nauthority implementing\nregulations and may\nexpand or clarify\nthese regulations in\nthe future. If we were\nsubject to the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nthe FDIC would have\nconsiderable powers,\nincluding: the power\nto remove directors\nand officers\nresponsible for our\nfailure and to appoint\nnew directors and\nofficers; the power to\nassign our assets and\nliabilities to a third\nparty or bridge\nfinancial company\nwithout the need for\ncreditor consent or\nprior court review;\nthe ability to\ndifferentiate among\nour creditors,\nincluding treating\ncertain creditors\nwithin the same class\nbetter than others,\nsubject to a minimum\nrecovery right on the\npart of disfavored\ncreditors to receive\nat least what they\nwould have received in\nbankruptcy\nliquidation; and broad\npowers to administer\nthe claims process to\ndetermine\ndistributions from the\nassets of the\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas been developing an\nSPOE strategy that\ncould be used to\nimplement the orderly\nliquidation authority.\n\nRegulators have also\ntaken and proposed\nvarious actions to\nfacilitate an SPOE\nstrategy under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nor other resolution\nregimes.\n\nFor more information\nabout our resolution\nplan-related\nsubmissions and\nassociated regulatory\nactions, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk,\u201d\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Total\nLoss-Absorbing\nCapacity, Long-Term\nDebt and Clean Holding\nCompany Requirements\u201d\nand \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory R\nequirements\u2014Resolution\nand Recovery\nPlanning.\u201d\n\nCyber and Information\nSecurity Risk\nManagement and\nProtection of Client\nInformation\n\nThe financial services\nindustry faces\nincreased global\nregulatory focus\nregarding cyber and\ninformation security\nrisk management\npractices. Many\naspects of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto cybersecurity\nlegal, regulatory and\ndisclosure\nrequirements enacted\nby U.S. federal and\nstate governments and\nother non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These\nrequirements are\ngenerally aimed at\ncodifying basic\ncybersecurity\nprotections and\nmandating data breach\nnotification\nrequirements.\n\nOur businesses are\nalso subject to\nincreasing privacy and\ndata protection legal\nrequirements\nconcerning the use and\nprotection of certain\npersonal information\nwith regard to\nclients, employees and\nothers. These\nrequirements impose\nmandatory privacy and\ndata protection\nobligations, including\nproviding for\nindividual rights,\nenhanced governance\nand accountability\nrequirements, and\nsignificant fines and\nlitigation risk for\nnoncompliance. In\naddition, several\njurisdictions have\nenacted or proposed\npersonal and other\ndata\n\nlocalization\nrequirements and\nrestrictions on cross-\nborder transfer of\npersonal and other\ndata that may restrict\nour ability to conduct\nbusiness in those\njurisdictions or\ncreate additional\nfinancial and\nregulatory burdens to\ndo so.\n\nNumerous jurisdictions\nhave passed laws,\nrules and regulations\nin these areas and\nmany are considering\nnew or updated ones\nthat could impact our\nbusinesses,\nparticularly as the\napplication,\ninterpretation and\nenforcement of these\nlaws, rules and\nregulations are often\nuncertain and\nevolving. Many aspects\nof our businesses are\nsubject to legal\nrequirements\nconcerning the use and\nprotection of certain\ncustomer and other\ninformation, as well\nas the privacy and\ncybersecurity laws\nreferenced above.

These\ninclude the level and\nvolatility of equity,\nfixed income and\ncommodity prices; the\nlevel, term structure\nand volatility of\ninterest rates;\ninflation and currency\nvalues; the level of\nother market indices,\nfiscal or monetary\npolicies established\nby central banks and\nfinancial regulators;\nand uncertainty\nconcerning the future\npath of interest\nrates, government\nshutdowns, debt\nceilings or funding,\nwhich may be driven by\neconomic conditions,\nrecessionary fears,\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of confidence\namong investors and\nclients due to the\neffects of widespread\nevents such as global\npandemics, natural\ndisasters, climate-\nrelated incidents,\nacts of war or\naggression,\ngeopolitical\ninstability, changes\nin U.S. presidential\nadministrations or\nCongress, changes to\nglobal trade policies,\nsupply chain\ncomplications and the\nimplementation of\ntariffs or\nprotectionist trade\npolicies and other\nfactors, or a\ncombination of these\nor other factors.\n\nThe results of our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, particularly\nresults relating to\nour involvement in\nprimary and secondary\nmarkets for all types\nof financial products,\nare subject to\nsubstantial market\nfluctuations due to a\nvariety of factors\nthat we cannot control\nor predict with great\ncertainty. These\nfluctuations impact\nresults by causing\nvariations in business\nflows and activity and\nin the fair value of\nsecurities and other\nfinancial products.\nFluctuations also\noccur due to the level\nof global market\nactivity, which, among\nother things, can be\nimpacted by market\nuncertainty or lack of\ninvestor and client\nconfidence due to\nunforeseen economic,\ngeopolitical or\n\nmarket conditions that\nin turn affect the\nsize, number and\ntiming of investment\nbanking client\nassignments and\ntransactions and the\nrealization of returns\nfrom our principal\ninvestments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable\nmarket or economic\nconditions, including\nequity market levels\nand the level and pace\nof changes in interest\nrates and asset\nvaluation, may have\nadverse impacts on the\nlevel of individual\ninvestor confidence\nand participation in\nthe global markets\nand/or the level of\nand mix of client\nassets, including\ndeposits, which would\nnegatively impact the\nresults of our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nSubstantial market\nfluctuations could\nalso cause variations\nin the value of our\ninvestments in our\nfunds, the flow of\ninvestment capital\ninto or from AUM, and\nthe way customers\nallocate capital among\nmoney market, equity,\nfixed income or other\ninvestment\nalternatives, which\ncould negatively\nimpact the results of\nour Investment\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nThe value of our\nfinancial instruments\nmay be materially\naffected by market\nfluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and\ndisruptions in the\nmarkets may make it\ndifficult to value and\nmonetize certain of\nour financial\ninstruments,\nparticularly during\nperiods of market\nuncertainty or\ndisplacement.\nSubsequent valuations\nin future periods, in\nlight of factors then\nprevailing, may result\nin significant changes\nin the value of these\ninstruments and may\nadversely impact\nhistorical or\nprospective fees and\nperformance-based\nincome (also known as\nincentive fees, which\ninclude carried\ninterest) in respect\nof certain businesses.\nIn addition, at the\ntime of any sales and\nsettlements of these\nfinancial instruments,\nthe price we\nultimately realize\nwill depend on the\ndemand and liquidity\nin the market at that\ntime and may be\nmaterially lower than\ntheir current fair\nvalue. Any of these\nfactors could cause a\ndecline in the value\nof our financial\ninstruments, which may\nadversely affect our\nresults of operations\nin future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial\nmarkets are\nsusceptible to severe\nevents evidenced by\nrapid depreciation in\nasset values\naccompanied by a\nreduction in asset\nliquidity. Under these\nextreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be as\neffective at\nmitigating trading\nlosses as they would\nbe under more normal\nmarket conditions.\nMoreover, under these\nconditions, market\nparticipants are\nparticularly exposed\nto trading strategies\nemployed by many\nmarket participants\nsimultaneously and on\na large scale, which\ncould lead to\nincreased individual\ncounterparty risk for\nour businesses.\nAlthough our risk\nmanagement and\nmonitoring processes\nseek to quantify and\nmitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves,\nsevere market events\nhave historically been\ndifficult to predict,\nand we could realize\nsignificant losses if\nextreme market events\nwere to occur.\n                                 \n  13    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nHolding large and\nconcentrated positions\nmay expose us to\nlosses.\n\nConcentration of risk\nmay reduce revenues or\nresult in losses in\nour market-making,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting\n(including block\ntrading) and lending\nbusinesses (including\nmargin lending) in the\nevent of unfavorable\nmarket movements.

The rating\nagencies continue to\nmonitor certain Firm-\nspecific and\nindustrywide factors\nthat are important to\nthe determination of\nour credit ratings.\nThese include\ngovernance, capital\nadequacy, the level\nand quality of\nearnings, liquidity\nand funding, risk\nappetite and\nmanagement, asset\nquality, strategic\ndirection, business\nmix, regulatory or\nlegislative changes,\nmacroeconomic\nenvironment and\nperceived levels of\nsupport, and it is\npossible that the\nrating agencies could\ndowngrade our ratings\nand those of similar\ninstitutions.\n\nOur credit ratings\nalso can have an\nadverse impact on\ncertain trading\nrevenues, particularly\nin those businesses\nwhere longer-term\ncounterparty\nperformance is a key\nconsideration,\n                                 \n  17    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nsuch as OTC and other\nderivative\ntransactions,\nincluding credit\nderivatives and\ninterest rate swaps.\nIn connection with\ncertain OTC trading\nagreements and certain\nother agreements\nassociated with our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, we may be\nrequired to provide\nadditional collateral\nto, or immediately\nsettle any outstanding\nliability balance\nwith, certain\ncounterparties in the\nevent of a credit\nrating downgrade.\n\nTermination of our\ntrading agreements\ncould cause us to\nsustain losses and\nimpair our liquidity\nby requiring us to\nfind other sources of\nfinancing or to make\nsignificant payments\nin the form of cash or\nsecurities.

If the\nFederal Reserve and\nthe FDIC were to\njointly determine that\nour resolution plan\nsubmission was not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution, and if we\nwere unsuccessful in\naddressing any\ndeficiencies\nidentified by the\nregulators, we or any\nof our subsidiaries\nmay be subject to more\nstringent capital,\nleverage, or liquidity\nrequirements or\nrestrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or after a\ntwo-year period, we\nmay be required to\ndivest assets or\noperations.\n\nIn addition, provided\nthat certain\nprocedures are met, we\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority\nunder Title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act with\nthe FDIC being\nappointed as receiver\ninstead of being\nresolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe FDIC\u2019s power under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nto disregard the\npriority of creditor\nclaims and treat\nsimilarly situated\ncreditors differently\nin certain\ncircumstances, subject\nto certain\nlimitations, could\nadversely impact\nholders of our\nunsecured\n\ndebt.

The\nParent Company has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to the\nFunding IHC. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nmaterial assets that\ncan be contributed\nunder the terms of the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement\n(other than shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets)\nto the Funding IHC.\nThe Funding IHC would\nbe obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity, as\napplicable, to certain\nsupported\nsubsidiaries, pursuant\nto the terms of the\nsecured amended and\nrestated support\nagreement.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and of\nthe Funding IHC,\nrespectively, under\nthe amended and\nrestated support\nagreement are in most\ncases secured on a\nsenior basis by the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany (other than\nshares in subsidiaries\nof the Parent Company\nand certain other\nassets), and the\nassets of the Funding\nIHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of\ncertain supported\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, against the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany with respect\nto such secured assets\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE\nstrategy, whether\napplied pursuant to\nour resolution plan or\nin a resolution\nproceeding under the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, is intended\nto result in better\noutcomes for creditors\noverall, there is no\nguarantee that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy, including\nthe provision of\nsupport to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s supported\nsubsidiaries pursuant\nto the secured amended\nand restated support\nagreement, will not\nresult in greater\nlosses for holders of\nour securities\ncompared with a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy for us.\n\nRegulators have taken\nand proposed various\nactions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode,\n                                 \n  19    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nand other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequires top-tier BHCs\nof U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to\nmaintain adequate\nTLAC, including equity\nand eligible long-term\ndebt, in order to\nensure that such\ninstitutions have\nenough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point\nof failure to be\nrecapitalized through\nthe conversion of debt\nto equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on\neligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is\nused. The combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the TLAC\nrequirement is that\nour losses will be\nimposed on the holders\nof eligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\nthe creditors of our\nsupported subsidiaries\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nE.U. jurisdictions,\nhave implemented, or\nare in the process of\nimplementing, changes\nto resolution regimes\nto provide resolution\nauthorities with the\nability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity organized in\nsuch jurisdiction by\nwriting down certain\nunsecured liabilities\nor converting certain\nunsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers are\nintended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured creditors.\nThis may increase the\noverall level of\ncapital and liquidity\nrequired by us on a\nconsolidated basis and\nmay result in\nlimitations on our\nability to efficiently\ndistribute capital and\nliquidity among our\naffiliated entities,\nincluding in times of\nstress. Non-U.S.\nregulators are also\nconsidering\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\nTLAC that would pass\nlosses up from the\nsubsidiaries to the\nParent Company and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe Parent Company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented\nfrom paying dividends\nor taking other\ncapital actions\nbecause of regulatory\nconstraints or revised\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve,\nincluding with respect\nto regulatory capital\nrequirements, stress\ntesting and capital\nplanning. We submit,\non at least an annual\nbasis, a capital plan\nto the Federal Reserve\ndescribing proposed\ndividend payments to\nshareholders, proposed\nrepurchases of our\noutstanding securities\nand other proposed\ncapital actions that\nwe intend to take. Our\nability to take\ncapital actions\ndescribed in the\ncapital plan is\ndependent on, among\nother factors, the\nresults of supervisory\nstress tests conducted\nby the Federal Reserve\nand our compliance\nwith regulatory\ncapital requirements\nimposed by the Federal\nReserve.\n\nIn addition, the\nFederal Reserve may\nchange regulatory\ncapital requirements\nto impose higher\nrequirements that\nrestrict our ability\nto take capital\nactions or may modify\nor impose other\nregulatory standards\nor restrictions that\nincrease our operating\nexpenses or constrain\nour ability to take\ncapital actions.

As\na result of this\ncompensation, it is\npossible we could face\nan increased number of\ninvestigations by the\nSEC or CFTC.\n\nWe have been named,\nfrom time to time, as\na defendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, as well as\ninvestigations or\nproceedings brought by\nregulatory agencies,\narising in connection\nwith our activities as\na global diversified\nfinancial services\ninstitution.

For\nadditional\ninformation, see Note\n14 to the financial\nstatements.\n\nA failure to address\nconflicts of interest\nappropriately could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and\nreputation.\n\nAs a global financial\nservices firm that\nprovides products and\nservices to a large\nand diversified group\nof clients, including\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nindividuals, we face\npotential conflicts of\ninterest in the normal\ncourse of business.\nFor example, potential\nconflicts can occur\nwhen there is a\ndivergence of\ninterests between us\nand a client, among\nclients, between an\nemployee on the one\nhand and us or a\nclient on the other,\nor situations in which\nwe may be a creditor\nof a client. Moreover,\nwe utilize multiple\nbrands and business\nchannels, including\nthose resulting from\nour acquisitions, and\ncontinue to enhance\nthe collaboration\nacross business\nsegments, which may\nheighten the potential\nconflicts of interest\nor the risk of\nimproper sharing of\ninformation.\n\nWe have policies,\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest,\nand we utilize various\nmeasures, such as the\nuse of disclosure, to\nmanage these potential\nconflicts. However,\nidentifying and\nmitigating potential\nconflicts of interest\ncan be complex and\nchallenging and can\nbecome the focus of\nmedia and regulatory\nscrutiny. Indeed,\nactions that merely\nappear to create a\nconflict can put our\nreputation at risk\neven if the likelihood\nof an actual conflict\nhas been mitigated. It\nis possible that\npotential conflicts\ncould give rise to\nlitigation or\nenforcement actions,\nwhich may lead to our\nclients being less\nwilling to enter into\ntransactions in which\na conflict may\n\noccur and could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and\nreputation.\n\nOur regulators also\nhave the ability to\nscrutinize our\nactivities for\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nthrough detailed\nexaminations of\nspecific transactions.\nFor example, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve\nsubjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve\nscrutiny with respect\nto transactions\nbetween our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates. Further,\nthe Volcker Rule\nsubjects us to\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding certain\ntransactions between\nus and our clients.\n                                              \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nOur risk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposures in all\nmarket environments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, which could\nresult in unexpected\nlosses.\n\nWe have devoted\nsignificant resources\nto develop our risk\nmanagement\ncapabilities and\nexpect to continue to\ndo so in the future.\nNonetheless, our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nmodels and processes,\nincluding our use of\nvarious risk models\nfor assessing market,\ncredit, liquidity and\noperational exposures\nand hedging\nstrategies, stress\ntesting and other\nanalysis, may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposure in all market\nenvironments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, including risks\nthat are unidentified\nor unanticipated.\n\nAs our businesses\nchange and grow,\nincluding through\nacquisitions and the\nintroduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies, such as\nartificial\nintelligence, and the\nmarkets in which we\noperate evolve, our\nrisk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not\nalways adapt with\nthose changes. Some of\nour methods of\nmanaging risk are\nbased upon our use of\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\nAs a result, these\nmethods may not\npredict future risk\nexposures, which could\nbe significantly\ngreater than the\nhistorical measures\nindicate.\n\nIn addition, many\nmodels we use are\nbased on assumptions\nor inputs regarding\ncorrelations among\nprices of various\nasset classes or other\nmarket indicators and,\ntherefore, cannot\nanticipate sudden,\nunanticipated, or\nunidentified market or\neconomic movements,\nsuch as the impact of\na pandemic or a sudden\ngeopolitical conflict,\nwhich could cause us\nto incur losses.\n\nManagement of market,\ncredit, liquidity,\noperational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and\ncompliance risks\nrequires, among other\nthings, policies and\nprocedures to record\nproperly and verify a\nlarge number of\ntransactions and\nevents, and these\npolicies and\nprocedures may not be\nfully effective. Our\ntrading risk\nmanagement strategies\nand techniques also\nseek to balance our\nability to profit from\ntrading positions with\nour exposure to\npotential losses.\n\nWhile we employ a\nbroad and diversified\nset of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\n                                 \n  21    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the timing\nof such outcomes. For\nexample, to the extent\nthat our trading or\ninvesting activities\ninvolve less liquid\ntrading markets or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sales\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and,\ntherefore, reduce our\nrisk associated with\nsuch positions. We\nmay, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course\nof our trading or\ninvesting activities.\nFor more information\non how we monitor and\nmanage market and\ncertain other risks\nand related\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Market Risk.\u201d\n\nClimate change\nmanifesting as\nphysical or transition\nrisks could result in\nincreased costs and\nrisks and adversely\naffect our operations,\nbusinesses and\nclients.\n\nThere continues to be\nincreasing concern\nover the risks of\nclimate change and\nrelated environmental\nsustainability\nmatters. The physical\nrisks of climate\nchange include harm to\npeople and property\narising from acute,\nclimate-related\nevents, such as\nfloods, hurricanes,\nheatwaves, droughts,\nand wildfires and\nchronic, longer-term\nshifts in climate\npatterns, such as\nhigher global average\ntemperatures, rising\nsea levels and long-\nterm droughts. Such\nevents could disrupt\nour operations or\nthose of our clients\nor third parties on\nwhich we rely,\nincluding through\ndirect damage to\nphysical assets and\nindirect impacts from\nsupply chain\ndisruption and market\nvolatility. These\nevents could impact\nthe ability of certain\nof our clients or\ncustomers to repay\ntheir obligations,\nreduce the value of\ncollateral, increase\ncosts, including the\ncost or availability\nof insurance coverage,\nand result in other\nadverse effects.\n\nThe transition risks\nof climate change\ninclude policy, legal,\ntechnology and market\nchanges. Examples of\nthese transition risks\ninclude changes in\nconsumer and business\nsentiment, related\ntechnologies,\nshareholder\npreferences and any\nadditional regulatory\nand legislative\nrequirements,\nincluding increased\ndisclosure or carbon\ntaxes. These risks\ncould increase our\nexpenses and adversely\nimpact our strategies,\nincluding by limiting\nour ability to pursue\ncertain business\nactivities or offer\ncertain products and\nservices. Negative\nimpacts to certain of\nour clients, such as\ndecreased\nprofitability and\nasset write-downs,\ncould also lead to\nincreased credit,\ncounterparty and\nliquidity risk to us.\n\nIn addition, our\nreputation and client\nrelationships may be\nadversely impacted as\na result of our, or\nour clients\u2019,\ninvolvement in certain\npractices that may\nhave, or are\nassociated with\nhaving, an adverse\nimpact on climate\nchange. Legislative or\nregulatory change\nregarding climate-\nrelated risks,\nincluding inconsistent\nrequirements and\nuncertainties, could\nresult in loss of\nrevenue, or increased\ncredit, market,\nliquidity, regulatory,\ncompliance,\nreputational and other\nrisks and costs.\n\nOur ability to achieve\nour climate-related\ntargets and\ncommitments and the\nway we go about this\ncould also result\n\nin reputational harm\nas a result of public\nsentiment, legislative\nand regulatory\nscrutiny (including\nfrom U.S. federal and\nstate governments and\nforeign policymakers\nand regulators),\nlitigation and reduced\ninvestor and\nstakeholder\nconfidence. If we are\nunable to achieve our\nobjectives relating to\nclimate change or our\ncurrent response to\nclimate change is\nperceived to be\nineffective or\ninsufficient, or the\nway we respond is\nperceived negatively,\nour business and\nreputation may suffer.\n\nThe risks associated\nwith, and the\nperspective of\nregulators,\ngovernments,\nshareholders,\nemployees and other\nstakeholders\nregarding, climate\nchange, as well as\ngeopolitical events,\ncontinue to evolve\nrapidly, making it\ndifficult to assess\nthe ultimate impact on\nus of climate-related\nrisks and\nuncertainties. As\nclimate risk is\ninterconnected with\nother risks, we have\ndeveloped and continue\nto enhance processes\nto embed climate risk\nconsiderations into\nour risk management\npractices and\ngovernance structures.\nDespite our risk\nmanagement practices,\nthe unpredictability\nsurrounding the timing\nand severity of\nclimate-related events\nand societal or\npolitical changes in\nreaction to them make\nit difficult to\npredict, identify,\nmonitor and mitigate\nclimate risks.\n\nIn addition, the\nmethodologies and data\nused to manage and\nmonitor climate risk\ncontinue to evolve.\nCurrent approaches\nutilize information\nand estimates that\nhave been derived from\ninformation or factors\nreleased by third-\nparty sources, which\nmay not reflect the\nlatest or most\naccurate data.\nClimate-related data,\nparticularly\ngreenhouse gas\nemissions for clients\nand counterparties,\nremains limited in\navailability and\nvaries in quality.\nCertain third-party\ninformation may also\nchange over time as\nmethodologies evolve\nand are refined. While\nwe believe this\ninformation is the\nbest available at the\ntime, we may only be\nable to complete\nlimited validation.\nFurthermore, modeling\ncapabilities and\nmethodologies to\nanalyze climate-\nrelated risks,\nalthough improving,\nremain nascent and\nemerging. These and\nother factors could\ncause results to\ndiffer materially,\nwhich could impact our\nability to manage\nclimate-related risks.\n\nReplacement or reform\nof certain interest\nrate benchmarks could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, securities,\nfinancial condition\nand results of\noperations.\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave sponsored\ninitiatives in recent\nyears to replace LIBOR\nand replace or reform\ncertain other interest\nrate benchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from use of the\nIBORs to alternative\nrates and other\npotential interest\nrate benchmark reforms\nhas been underway for\na number of years.\n\nThese reforms have\ncaused and may in the\nfuture cause such\nrates to perform\ndifferently than in\nthe past, or to cease\nentirely, or have\nother consequences\nthat are contrary to\nmarket expectations.\n\nThe ongoing market\ntransition away from\nthese interest rate\nbenchmarks to\nalternative reference\nrates is complex and\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    22  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ncould have a range of\nadverse impacts on our\nbusiness, securities,\nfinancial condition\nand results of\noperations, including:\n\n\u2022 Adversely impacting\nthe pricing,\nliquidity, value of,\nreturn on and trading\nfor a broad array of\nfinancial products,\nincluding any\nsecurities, loans and\nderivatives that are\nincluded in our\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities that are\nlinked to these\ninterest rate\nbenchmarks;\n\n\u2022 Inquiries, reviews\nor other actions from\nregulators in respect\nof our (or the\nmarket\u2019s) preparation,\nreadiness, transition\nplans and actions\nregarding the\nreplacement of a\nlegacy interest rate\nbenchmark with one or\nmore alternative\nreference rates;\n\n\u2022 Disputes, litigation\nor other actions with\nclients,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors in various\nscenarios, such as\nregarding the\ninterpretation and\nenforceability of\nprovisions in IBOR-\nbased products such as\nfallback language or\nother related\nprovisions, including\nin the case of\nfallbacks to the\nalternative reference\nrates, any economic,\nlegal, operational or\nother impact resulting\nfrom the fundamental\ndifferences between\nthe IBORs and the\nvarious alternative\nreference rates or\nregarding the\ninterpretation of\napplicable\nlegislation,\nregulations or rules;\nand\n\n\u2022 Causing us to incur\nadditional costs in\nrelation to any of the\nabove factors.\n\nOther factors include\nthe pace of the\ntransition to the\nalternative reference\nrates, timing\nmismatches between\ncash and derivative\nmarkets, the specific\nterms and parameters\nfor and market\nacceptance of any\nalternative reference\nrate, market\nconventions for the\nuse of any alternative\nreference rate in\nconnection with a\nparticular product\n(including the timing\nand market adoption of\nany conventions\nproposed or\nrecommended by any\nindustry or other\ngroup), prices of and\nthe liquidity of\ntrading markets for\nproducts based on\nalternative reference\nrates, and our ability\nto further transition\nand develop\nappropriate systems\nand analytics for one\nor more alternative\nreference rates.\n\nSee also \u201cManagement's\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Regulatory \nRequirements\u2014Regulator\ny Developments and\nOther Matters.\u201d\n                                              \n  Competitive Environment                     \n                                              \nWe face strong\ncompetition from\nfinancial services\nfirms and others,\nwhich could lead to\npricing pressures that\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nrevenues and\nprofitability.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry and all\naspects of our\nbusinesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. We compete\nwith commercial banks,\ninvestment banking\nfirms, brokerage\nfirms, insurance\ncompanies, exchanges,\nelectronic trading and\nclearing platforms,\nfinancial data\nrepositories,\ninvestment advisers\nand sponsors of mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nreal assets funds and\nprivate credit and\nequity funds, energy\ncompanies, financial\ntechnology firms\n\nand other companies\noffering financial and\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally,\nincluding, in certain\ninstances, through the\ninternet. We also\ncompete with companies\nthat provide online\ntrading and banking\nservices, investment\nadvisory services,\nrobo-advice\ncapabilities, access\nto digital asset\ncapabilities and\nservices, and other\nfinancial products and\nservices. We compete\non the basis of\nseveral factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, capital or\naccess to capital,\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\ntechnology,\nreputation, risk\nappetite and price.\n\nOver time, certain\nsectors of the\nfinancial services\nindustry have become\nmore concentrated, as\ninstitutions involved\nin a broad range of\nfinancial services\nhave left businesses,\nbeen acquired by or\nmerged into other\nfirms, or have\ndeclared bankruptcy.\nSuch changes could\nresult in our\nremaining competitors\ngaining greater\ncapital and other\nresources, such as the\nability to offer a\nbroader range of\nproducts and services\nand geographic\ndiversity, or new\ncompetitors may\nemerge.\n\nWe have experienced\nand may continue to\nexperience pricing\npressures as a result\nof these factors and\nas some of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nreducing prices,\neliminating\ncommissions or other\nfees, or providing\nmore favorable terms\nof business. In\naddition, certain of\nour competitors may be\nsubject to different\nand, in some cases,\nless stringent, legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan we are, thereby\nputting us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage. Some new\ncompetitors in the\nfinancial technology\nsector have sought to\ntarget existing\nsegments of our\nbusinesses that could\nbe susceptible to\ndisruption by\ninnovative or less\nregulated business\nmodels. For more\ninformation regarding\nthe competitive\nenvironment in which\nwe operate, see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Competition\u201d\nand\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation.\u201d\n\nAutomated trading\nmarkets and the\nintroduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies may\nadversely affect our\nbusiness and may\nincrease competition.\n\nWe continue to\nexperience price\ncompetition in some of\nour businesses. In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities\nand other automated\ntrading platforms, and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies,\nincluding generative\nartificial\nintelligence, will\nlikely continue the\npressure on revenues.\nThe trend toward\ndirect access to\nautomated, electronic\nmarkets will likely\ncontinue as additional\nmarkets move to more\nautomated trading\nplatforms. We have\nexperienced and will\nlikely continue to\nexperience competitive\npressures in these and\nother areas in the\nfuture.\n\nOur ability to retain\nand attract qualified\nemployees is critical\nto the success of our\nbusiness and the\nfailure to do so may\nmaterially adversely\naffect our\nperformance.\n\nOur people are our\nmost important asset.\nWe compete with\nvarious other\ncompanies in\nattracting and\nretaining qualified\n                                 \n  23    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nand skilled personnel.\nIf we are unable to\ncontinue to attract,\nintegrate and retain\nhighly qualified\nemployees or\nsuccessfully\ntransition key roles,\nor do so at levels or\nin forms necessary to\nmaintain our\ncompetitive position,\nour performance,\nincluding our\ncompetitive position\nand results of\noperations, could be\nmaterially adversely\naffected.

We\nperiodically assess\nthe design of our\ncybersecurity controls\nagainst the Cyber Risk\nInstitute Cyber\nProfile, which is\nbased on the National\nInstitute of Standards\nand Technology\n(\u201cNIST\u201d) Cybersecurity\nFramework for\nImproving Critical\nInfrastructure\nCybersecurity, as well\nas global\ncybersecurity\nregulations, and\ndevelop improvements\nto those controls in\nresponse to that\nassessment. Our\nCybersecurity Program\nalso includes\ncybersecurity and\ninformation security\npolicies, procedures\nand technologies that\nare designed to\naddress regulatory\nrequirements and\nprotect our clients\u2019,\nemployees\u2019 and own\ndata against\nunauthorized\ndisclosure,\nmodification and\nmisuse. These\npolicies, procedures\nand technologies cover\na broad range of\nareas, including:\nidentification of\ninternal and external\nthreats, access\ncontrol, data\nsecurity, protective\ncontrols, detection of\nmalicious or\nunauthorized activity,\nincident response, and\nrecovery planning.\n\nOur threat\nintelligence function\nwithin the\nCybersecurity Program\nactively engages in\nprivate and public\ninformation sharing\ncommunities and\nleverages both\ncommercial and\nproprietary products\nto collect a wide\nvariety of industry\nand governmental\ninformation regarding\nthe latest\ncybersecurity threats,\nwhich informs our\ncybersecurity risk\nassessments and\n\nstrategy. This\ninformation is also\nprovided to an\ninternal forensics\nteam, which develops\nand implements\ntechnologies designed\nto help detect these\ncybersecurity threats\nacross our\nenvironment. Where a\npotential threat is\nidentified in our\nenvironment, our\nincident response team\nevaluates the\npotential impact to\nthe Firm and\ncoordinates\nremediation where\nrequired. These\ngroups, as well as the\nOperational Risk\nDepartment, review\nexternal cybersecurity\nincidents that may be\nrelevant to the Firm,\nand the outcomes of\nthese incidents\nfurther inform the\ndesign of our\nCybersecurity Program.\nIn addition, we\nmaintain a robust\nglobal training\nprogram on\ncybersecurity risks\nand requirements and\nconduct regular\nphishing email\nsimulations for our\nemployees and\nconsultants.\n\nOur processes are\ndesigned to help\noversee, identify and\nmitigate cybersecurity\nrisks associated with\nour use of third-party\nvendors. We maintain a\nthird-party risk\nmanagement program\nthat includes\nevaluation of, and\nresponse to,\ncybersecurity risks at\nour third-party\nvendors. Prior to\nengaging third-party\nvendors to provide\nservices to the Firm,\nwe conduct assessments\nof the third-party\nvendors\u2019 cybersecurity\nprograms to identify\nthe impact of their\nservices on the\ncybersecurity risks to\nthe Firm. Once on-\nboarded, third-party\nvendors\u2019 cybersecurity\nprograms are subject\nto risk-based\noversight, which may\ninclude security\nquestionnaires,\nsubmission of\nindependent security\naudit reports or a\nFirm audit of the\nthird-party vendor\u2019s\nsecurity program, and,\nwith limited\nexceptions, third-\nparty vendors are\nrequired to meet our\ncybersecurity\nstandards. Where a\nthird-party vendor\ncannot meet those\nstandards, its\nservices, and the\nresidual risk to the\nFirm, are subject to\nreview, challenge and\nescalation through our\nrisk management\nprocesses and ERM\ncommittees, which may\nultimately result in\nrequesting increased\nsecurity measures or\nceasing engagement\nwith such third-party\nvendor.\n\nOur Cybersecurity\nProgram is regularly\nassessed by the\nInternal Audit\nDepartment (\u201cIAD\u201d)\nthrough various\nassurance activities,\nwith the results\nreported to the Audit\nCommittee of the Board\n(\u201cBAC\u201d) and the BOTC.\nAnnually, certain\nelements of the\nCybersecurity Program\nare subject to an\naudit by an\nindependent\nconsultant, as well as\nan assessment by a\nseparate, independent\nthird party, the\nresults of which,\nincluding\nopportunities\nidentified for\nimprovement and\nrelated remediation\nplans, are reviewed\nwith the BOTC.

The market\nenvironment impacted\nour businesses in\n2023, as discussed\nfurther in \u201cBusiness\nSegments\u201d herein, and,\nto the extent that it\ncontinues to remain\nuncertain, could\nadversely impact\nclient confidence and\nrelated activity.

From\ntime to time, we may\ndisclose certain \u201cnon-\nGAAP financial\nmeasures\u201d in this\ndocument or in the\ncourse of our earnings\nreleases, earnings and\nother conference\ncalls, financial\npresentations,\ndefinitive proxy\nstatements and other\npublic disclosures. A\n\u201cnon-GAAP financial\nmeasure\u201d excludes, or\nincludes, amounts from\nthe most directly\ncomparable measure\ncalculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP. We consider the\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures we disclose\nto be useful to us,\ninvestors, analysts\nand other stakeholders\nby providing further\ntransparency about, or\nan alternate means of\nassessing or comparing\nour financial\ncondition, operating\nresults and capital\nadequacy. These\nmeasures are not in\naccordance with, or a\nsubstitute for, U.S.\nGAAP and may be\ndifferent from or\ninconsistent with non-\nGAAP financial\nmeasures used by other\ncompanies. Whenever we\nrefer to a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, we\nwill also generally\ndefine it or present\nthe most directly\ncomparable financial\nmeasure calculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP, along with a\nreconciliation of the\ndifferences between\nthe U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measure and\nthe non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. We present\ncertain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures\nthat exclude the\nimpact of mark-to-\nmarket gains and\nlosses on DCP\ninvestments from net\nrevenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nThe impact of DCP is\nprimarily reflected in\nour Wealth Management\nbusiness segment\nresults. These\nmeasures allow for\nbetter comparability\nof period-to-period\nunderlying operating\nperformance and\nrevenue trends,\nespecially in our\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment. By\nexcluding the impact\nof these items, we are\nbetter able to\ndescribe the business\ndrivers and resulting\nimpact to net revenues\nand corresponding\nchange to the\nassociated\ncompensation expenses.\nCompensation expense\nfor DCP awards is\ncalculated based on\nthe notional value of\nthe award granted,\nadjusted for changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments that\nemployees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards. We invest\ndirectly, as\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of our\nobligations under\nthese DCP awards.\nChanges in the fair\nvalue of such\ninvestments, net of\nfinancing costs, are\nrecorded in net\nrevenues, and included\nin Transactional\nrevenues in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nrecognized in net\nrevenues, there is\ntypically a timing\ndifference between the\nimmediate recognition\nof gains and losses on\nour investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\n\nmay not be material to\nour Income before\nprovision for income\ntaxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment reported\nratios and operating\nmetrics in certain\nperiods due to\npotentially\nsignificant impacts to\nnet revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nFor additional\ninformation on DCP,\nrefer to \u201cOther\nMatters\u201d herein.

Business\nSegments Substantially all of our operating\nrevenues and operating expenses are directly\nattributable to our business segments. Certain\nrevenues and expenses have been allocated to\neach business segment, generally in proportion\nto its respective net revenues, non-interest\nexpenses or other relevant measures. See Note\n22 to the financial statements for segment net\nrevenues by income statement line item and\ninformation on intersegment transactions.

Within\nthe Institutional Securities business segment,\nTrading revenues arise from transactions in\ncash instruments and derivatives in which we\nact as a market maker for our clients. In this\nrole, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise\ntransact with customers under a variety of\nmarket conditions and to provide firm or\nindicative prices in response to customer\nrequests. Our liquidity obligations can be\nexplicit in some cases, and in others,\ncustomers expect us to be willing to transact\nwith them. In order to most effectively\nfulfill our market-making function, we engage\nin activities across all of our trading\nbusinesses that include, but are not limited\nto: \u2022 taking positions in anticipation of, and\nin response to, customer demand to buy or sell\nand\u2014depending on the liquidity of the relevant\nmarket and the size of the position\u2014to hold\nthose positions for a period of time; \u2022\nbuilding, maintaining and rebalancing\ninventory held to facilitate client activity\nthrough trades with other market participants;\n\u2022 managing and assuming basis risk (risk\nassociated with imperfect hedging) between\nrisks incurred from the facilitation of client\ntransactions and the standardized products\navailable in the market to hedge those risks;\n\u2022 trading in the market to remain current on\npricing and trends; and \u2022 engaging in other\nactivities to provide efficiency and liquidity\nfor markets. In many markets, the realized and\nunrealized gains and losses from purchase and\nsale transactions will include any spreads\nbetween bids and offers. Certain fees received\non loans carried at fair value and dividends\nfrom equity securities are also recorded in\nTrading revenues since they relate to\npositions carried at fair value.

Net Interest\nNet interest revenues\nof $8,118 million in\n2023 increased 9%\ncompared with the\nprior year, primarily\ndue to the net effect\nof higher interest\nrates, partially\noffset by changes in\ndeposit mix. The level\nand pace of interest\nrate changes and other\nmacroeconomic factors\ncontinued to impact\nclient preferences for\ncash allocation to\nhigher-yielding\nproducts and the pace\nof reallocation of\nclient balances,\nresulting in changes\nin the deposit mix and\nassociated interest\nexpense, as well as\nclient demand for\nloans. If these trends\npersist, net interest\nincome could be\nimpacted in future\nperiods. Provision for\nCredit Losses The\nProvision for credit\nlosses on loans and\nlending commitments of\n$131 million in 2023\nwas primarily related\nto deteriorating\nconditions in the\ncommercial real estate\nsector, including\nprovisions for certain\nspecific loans, mainly\nin the office\nportfolio. The\nProvision for credit\nlosses on loans and\nlending commitments\nwas $69 million in\n2022, primarily driven\nby portfolio growth in\nResidential real\nestate loans and\ndeteriorating\nconditions in the\ncommercial real estate\nsector.

Includes Investments, Trading, Commissions\nand fees, Net interest and Other revenues.\n\nNet Revenues Asset Management and Related Fees\nAsset management and related fees of $5,231\nmillion in 2023 decreased 2% compared with the\nprior year, primarily due to a shift in the\nmix of average AUM, driven by the cumulative\neffect of net flows. Asset management revenues\nare influenced by the level, relative mix of\nAUM and related fee rates. The market\nenvironment and client preferences in recent\nquarters have impacted the mix of our average\nLong-Term AUM level across certain asset\nclasses. To the extent these conditions\ncontinue, we would expect our Asset management\nrevenue to continue to be negatively impacted.\nSee \u201cAssets Under Management or Supervision\u201d\nherein. Performance-based Income and Other\nPerformance-based income and other revenues\nincreased to $139 million in 2023, from $43\nmillion in the prior year, primarily due to\nmark-to-market gains in 2023 compared with\nlosses in the prior year on DCP investments\nand investments in public funds, partially\noffset by lower accrued carried interest in\ncertain private funds. Non-Interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses of $4,528 million in\n2023 decreased 1% from the prior year,\nprimarily due to lower Compensation and\nbenefits expenses. \u2022 Compensation and benefits\nexpenses decreased primarily due to lower\nexpenses related to compensation associated\nwith carried interest, partially offset by\nhigher expenses related to DCP. \u2022 Non-\ncompensation expenses were relatively\nunchanged for the current year.\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    42  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAssets Under\nManagement or\nSupervision\nRollforwards\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n1.

Employees\nare permitted to\nallocate the value of\ntheir deferred awards\namong a menu of\nnotional investments,\nwhereby the value of\ntheir awards will\ntrack the performance\nof the referenced\nnotional investments.\nThe menu of\ninvestments, which is\nselected by the Firm,\nincludes fixed income,\nequity, commodity and\nmoney market funds.\nCompensation expense\nfor DCP awards is\ncalculated based on\nthe notional value of\nthe award granted,\nadjusted for changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments that\nemployees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards. We invest\ndirectly, as\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of our\nobligations under\nthese DCP awards.\nChanges in the fair\nvalue of such\ninvestments, net of\nfinancing costs, are\nrecorded in net\nrevenues, and included\nin Transactional\nrevenues in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nrecognized in net\nrevenues, there is\ntypically a timing\ndifference between the\nimmediate recognition\nof gains and losses on\nour investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nmay not be material to\nour Income before\nprovision for income\ntaxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment reported\nratios and operating\nmetrics in certain\nperiods due to\npotentially\nsignificant impacts to\nnet revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nAt December 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022,\nsubstantially all\nemployee referenced\ninvestments that\nsubjected the Firm to\nprice risk were\neconomically hedged.\nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026        2023       2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deferr\u2026                                     \n  cash-b\u2026    $    693    $   761    $    810  \n  awards                                      \n  Return                                      \n  on              668       -716         526  \n  refere\u2026                                     \n  invest\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $  1,361    $    45    $  1,336  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\nby Segment\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026        2023       2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Instit\u2026    $    162    $   -97    $    372  \n  Securi\u2026                                     \n  Wealth          984         11         798  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Invest\u2026         215        131         166  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $  1,361    $    45    $  1,336  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    44  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nProjected Future\nCompensation\nObligation 1\n                                              \n  $ in millions                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Award liabilities at December     $  5,331  \n  31, 20232, 3                                \n  Fully vested amounts to be                  \n  distributed by the end                -905  \n  of February 20244                           \n  Unrecognized portion of prior               \n  awards at December                   1,373  \n  31, 20233                                   \n  2023 performance year awards           357  \n  granted in 20243                            \n  Total5                            $  6,156  \n                                              \n1.

We adopted the\nfollowing accounting update on January 1,\n2024, with no material impact on our financial\ncondition or results of operations upon\nadoption: \u2022 Investments\u2014Tax Credit Structures\n. This accounting update permits an election\nto account for tax equity investments using\nthe proportional amortization method if\ncertain conditions are met. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the initial\ncost of the investment is amortized in\nproportion to the income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits received and recognized\nnet in the income statement as a component of\nprovision for income taxes. The update\nrequires a separate accounting policy election\nto be made for each tax credit program.\nAdditional disclosures are required regarding\n(i) the nature of our tax equity investments\nand (ii) the effect of our tax equity\ninvestments and related income tax credits on\nthe financial condition and results of\noperations. We are currently evaluating the\nfollowing accounting updates; however, we do\nnot expect a material impact on our financial\ncondition or results of operations upon\nadoption: \u2022 Income Tax Disclosures. This\naccounting update requires disclosure of\nadditional information in relation to income\ntaxes, including additional disaggregation of\nthe income tax rate reconciliation and income\ntaxes paid. For the income tax rate\nreconciliation, this update requires (1)\ndisclosure of specific categories of\nreconciling items; and (2) providing\nadditional information for reconciling items\nthat meet a quantitative threshold (if the\neffect of those reconciling items is equal to\nor greater than 5 percent of the amount\ncomputed by multiplying pretax income (or\nloss) by the applicable statutory income tax\nrate).

The\nhierarchy is broken\ndown into three\nlevels: wherein Level\n1 represents quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets, Level 2\nrepresents valuations\nbased on quoted prices\nin markets that are\nnot active or for\nwhich all significant\ninputs are observable,\nand Level 3 consists\nof valuation\ntechniques that\nincorporate\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nand, therefore,\nrequire the greatest\nuse of judgment. The\nfair values for the\nsubstantial majority\nof our financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value\nare based on\nobservable prices and\ninputs and are\nclassified in level 1\nor 2, of the fair\nvalue\n\nhierarchy. Level 3\nfinancial assets\nrepresented 1.2% and\n1.4% of our total\nassets, as of December\n31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nIn periods of market\ndisruption, the\nobservability of\nprices and inputs, as\nwell as market\nliquidity, may be\nreduced for many\ninstruments, which\ncould cause an\ninstrument to be\nrecategorized from\nLevel 1 to Level 2 or\nfrom Level 2 to Level\n3. In addition, a\ndownturn in market\nconditions could lead\nto declines in the\nvaluation of many\ninstruments carried at\nfair value.\nImprecision in\nestimating\nunobservable market\ninputs or other\nfactors can affect the\namount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a\nparticular position.\nThe Firm uses various\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in the\ndetermination of fair\nvalue. The use of\nmethodologies or\nassumptions different\nthan those used by the\nFirm could result in a\ndifferent estimate of\nfair value at the\nreporting date. For\nfurther information on\nthe definition of fair\nvalue, Level 1, Level\n2, Level 3 and related\nvaluation techniques,\nand quantitative\ninformation about and\nsensitivity of\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nused in Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements,\nsee Notes 2 and 4 to\nthe financial\nstatements.\n\nWhere appropriate,\nvaluation adjustments\nare made to account\nfor various factors,\nsuch as liquidity risk\n(bid-ask adjustments),\ncredit quality, model\nuncertainty,\nconcentration risk and\nfunding, in order to\narrive at fair value.\nFor a further\ndiscussion of\nvaluation adjustments\nthat we apply, see\nNote 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Intangible Assets              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe test goodwill for\nimpairment on an\nannual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\nEvaluating goodwill\nfor impairment\nrequires management to\nmake significant\njudgments, including,\nin part, the use of\nunobservable inputs\nthat are subject to\nuncertainty. Goodwill\nimpairment tests are\nperformed at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below our\nbusiness segments.\nGoodwill no longer\nretains its\nassociation with a\nparticular acquisition\nonce it has been\nassigned to a\nreporting unit. As\nsuch, all the\nactivities of a\nreporting unit,\nwhether acquired or\norganically developed,\nare available to\nsupport the value of\nthe goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, we\nhave the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case, the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\n\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, we\ncompare the fair value\nof a reporting unit\nwith its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue,\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    46  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nlimited by the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\n\nThe carrying value of\neach reporting unit is\ndetermined based on\nthe capital allocated\nto the reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunits is derived based\non valuation\ntechniques we believe\nmarket participants\nwould use for each of\nthe reporting units.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue is generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology.\nIn certain instances,\nwe may also utilize\nmethodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncomparable companies.\n\nThe discounted cash\nflow methodology uses\nprojected future cash\nflows based on the\nreporting units\u2019\nearnings forecast. The\ndiscount rate used\nrepresents an estimate\nof the cost of equity\nfor that reporting\nunit based on the\nCapital Asset Pricing\nModel.\n\nAt each annual\ngoodwill impairment\ntesting date, each of\nour reporting units\nwith goodwill had a\nfair value that was\nsubstantially in\nexcess of its carrying\nvalue.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nIntangible assets are\ninitially recorded at\ncost, or in the\nsituation where\nacquired as part of a\nbusiness combination,\nat the fair value\ndetermined as part of\nthe acquisition method\nof accounting.\nSubsequently,\namortizable intangible\nassets are carried in\nthe balance sheet at\namortized cost, where\namortization is\nrecognized over their\nestimated useful\nlives. Indefinite\nlived intangible\nassets are not\namortized but are\ntested for impairment\non an annual basis as\nof July 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\n\nOn a quarterly basis:\n\n\u2022 All intangible\nassets are assessed\nfor the presence of\nimpairment indicators.\nWhere such indicators\nare present, an\nevaluation for\nimpairment is\nconducted.\n\n\u2022 For amortizable\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment loss exists\nif the carrying amount\nof the intangible\nasset is not\nrecoverable and\nexceeds its fair\nvalue. The carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\nnot recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the\nexpected undiscounted\ncash flows.\n\n\u2022 For indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment exists if\nthe carrying amount of\nthe intangible asset\nexceeds its fair\nvalue.\n\n\u2022 Amortizable\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nremaining useful life\nor the finite life\nclassification should\nbe revised. In such\ncases, the remaining\ncarrying amount is\namortized\nprospectively over the\nrevised useful life,\nunless it is\ndetermined that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is indefinite,\nin which case the\nintangible asset is\nnot amortized.\n\n\u2022 Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is no longer\nindefinite; in such\ncases, the carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\namortized\nprospectively over its\nremaining useful life.\n\nThe initial valuation\nof an intangible asset\nas part of the\nacquisition method of\naccounting and the\nsubsequent valuation\nof intangible assets\nas part of an\nimpairment assessment\nare subjective and\nbased, in part, on\ninputs that are\nunobservable and can\nbe subject to\nuncertainty. These\ninputs include, but\nare not limited to,\nforecasted cash flows,\nrevenue growth rates,\ncustomer attrition\nrates and discount\nrates.\n\nFor both goodwill and\nintangible assets, to\nthe extent an\nimpairment loss is\nrecognized, the loss\nestablishes the new\ncost basis of the\nasset. Subsequent\nreversal of impairment\nlosses is not\npermitted. For\namortizable intangible\nassets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized\nover the remaining\nuseful life of that\nasset. Unanticipated\ndeclines in our\nrevenue generating\ncapability, adverse\nmarket or economic\nevents, and regulatory\nactions, could result\nin material impairment\ncharges in future\nperiods.\n\nSee Notes 2 and 10 to\nthe financial\nstatements for\nadditional information\nabout goodwill and\nintangible assets.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Contingencies          \n                                              \nIn the normal course\nof business, we have\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with our\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\n\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages.

In addition,\neven where we have\ndetermined that a loss\nis probable or\nreasonably possible or\nan exposure to loss or\nrange of loss exists\nin excess of the\nliability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, we are\noften unable to\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of the loss\nor range of loss. It\nis particularly\ndifficult to determine\nif a loss is probable\nor reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, where the\nfactual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved in an\ninvestigation or\nproceeding before a\ndetermination can be\nmade that a loss or\nadditional loss (or\nrange of loss or range\nof additional loss) is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, including\nthrough potentially\nlengthy discovery or\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification,\nthe calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\ndeciding when and if\nto make these\naccruals, and the\nactual cost of a legal\nclaim or regulatory\nfine/penalty may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals.\n\nSee Note 14 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation on legal\ncontingencies.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nWe are subject to the\nincome tax laws of the\nU.S., its states and\nmunicipalities and\nthose of the foreign\njurisdictions in which\nwe have business\noperations.

Other assets primarily\nincludes premises, equipment and software, ROU\nassets related to leases, other investments\nand deferred tax assets. A substantial portion\nof total assets consists of cash and cash\nequivalents, liquid marketable securities and\nshort-term receivables. In the Institutional\nSecurities business segment, these arise from\nmarket-making, financing and prime brokerage\nactivities, and in the Wealth Management\nbusiness segment, these arise from banking\nactivities, including management of the\ninvestment portfolio.

Liquidity Risk Management\nFramework The primary goal of our Liquidity\nRisk Management Framework is to ensure that we\nhave access to adequate funding across a wide\nrange of market conditions and time horizons.\nThe framework is designed to enable us to\nfulfill our financial obligations and support\nthe execution of our business strategies. The\nfollowing principles guide our Liquidity Risk\nManagement Framework: \u2022 Sufficient liquidity\nresources, which consist of HQLA and cash\ndeposits with banks (\u201cLiquidity Resources\u201d)\nshould be maintained to cover maturing\nliabilities and other planned and contingent\noutflows; \u2022 Maturity profile of assets and\nliabilities should be aligned, with limited\nreliance on short-term funding; \u2022 Source,\ncounterparty, currency, region and term of\nfunding should be diversified; and \u2022 Liquidity\nStress Tests should anticipate, and account\nfor, periods of limited access to funding. The\ncore components of our Liquidity Risk\nManagement Framework are the Required\nLiquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests\nand Liquidity Resources, which support our\ntarget liquidity profile. Required Liquidity\nFramework Our Required Liquidity Framework\nestablishes the amount of liquidity we must\nhold in both normal and stressed environments\nto ensure that our financial condition and\noverall soundness are not adversely affected\nby an inability (or perceived inability) to\nmeet our financial obligations in a timely\nmanner. The Required Liquidity Framework\nconsiders the most constraining liquidity\nrequirement to satisfy all regulatory and\ninternal limits at a consolidated and legal\nentity level. Liquidity Stress Tests We use\nLiquidity Stress Tests to model external and\nintercompany liquidity flows across multiple\nscenarios and a range of time horizons. These\nscenarios contain various combinations of\nidiosyncratic and systemic stress events of\ndifferent severity and duration. The\nmethodology, implementation, production and\nanalysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are\nimportant components of the Required Liquidity\nFramework. The assumptions used in our various\nLiquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but\nare not limited to, the following: \u2022 No\ngovernment support; \u2022 No access to equity and\nlimited access to unsecured debt markets;\n                                 \n  49    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n\u2022 Repayment of all\nunsecured debt\nmaturing within the\nstress horizon; \u2022\nHigher haircuts for\nand significantly\nlower availability of\nsecured funding; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\nby trading\ncounterparties,\ncertain exchanges and\nclearing organizations\nrelated to credit\nrating downgrades; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\ndue to collateral\nsubstitutions,\ncollateral disputes\nand uncalled\ncollateral; \u2022\nDiscretionary\nunsecured debt\nbuybacks; \u2022 Drawdowns\non lending commitments\nprovided to third\nparties; and \u2022 Client\ncash withdrawals and\nreduction in customer\nshort positions that\nfund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nare produced and\nresults are reported\nat different levels,\nincluding major\noperating subsidiaries\nand major currencies,\nto capture specific\ncash requirements and\ncash availability\nacross the Firm,\nincluding a limited\nnumber of asset sales\nin a stressed\nenvironment. The\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nassume that\nsubsidiaries will use\ntheir own liquidity\nfirst to fund their\nobligations before\ndrawing liquidity from\nthe Parent Company and\nthat the Parent\nCompany will support\nits subsidiaries and\nwill not have access\nto subsidiaries\u2019\nliquidity reserves. In\naddition to the\nassumptions\nunderpinning the\nLiquidity Stress\nTests, we take into\nconsideration\nsettlement risk\nrelated to intraday\nsettlement and\nclearing of securities\nand financing\nactivities. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, we\nmaintained sufficient\nLiquidity Resources to\nmeet current and\ncontingent funding\nobligations as modeled\nin our Liquidity\nStress Tests.\nLiquidity Resources We\nmaintain sufficient\nLiquidity Resources to\ncover daily funding\nneeds and to meet\nstrategic liquidity\ntargets sized by the\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework and\nLiquidity Stress\nTests.

We\npursue a strategy of\ndiversification of\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding sources (by\nproduct, investor and\nregion) and attempt to\nensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities\nequals or exceeds the\nexpected holding\nperiod of the assets\nbeing financed. Our\ngoal is to achieve an\noptimal mix of durable\nsecured and unsecured\nfinancing. We fund our\nbalance sheet on a\nglobal basis through\ndiverse sources. These\nsources include our\nequity capital,\nborrowings, bank\nnotes, securities sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, securities\nlending, deposits,\nletters of credit and\nlines of credit. We\nhave active financing\nprograms for both\nstandard and\nstructured products\ntargeting global\ninvestors and\ncurrencies. Treasury\nallocates interest\nexpense to our\nbusinesses based on\nthe tenor and interest\nrate profile of the\nassets being funded.\nTreasury similarly\nallocates interest\nincome to businesses\ncarrying deposit\nproducts and other\nliabilities across the\nbusinesses based on\nthe characteristics of\nthose deposits and\nother liabilities.\nSecured Financing The\nliquid nature of the\nmarketable securities\nand short-term\nreceivables arising\nprincipally from sales\nand trading activities\nin the Institutional\nSecurities business\nsegment\n\nprovides us with\nflexibility in\nmanaging the\ncomposition of our\nbalance sheet. Secured\nfinancing investors\nprincipally focus on\nthe quality of the\neligible collateral\nposted. Accordingly,\nwe actively manage our\nsecured financings\nbased on the quality\nof the assets being\nfunded. We have\nestablished longer-\ntenor secured funding\nrequirements for less\nliquid asset classes,\nfor which funding may\nbe at risk in the\nevent of a market\ndisruption. We define\nhighly liquid assets\nas government-issued\nor government-\nguaranteed securities\nwith a high degree of\nfundability and less\nliquid assets as those\nthat do not meet these\ncriteria. To further\nminimize the\nrefinancing risk of\nsecured financing for\nless liquid assets, we\nhave established\nconcentration limits\nto diversify our\ninvestor base and\nreduce the amount of\nmonthly maturities for\nsecured financing of\nless liquid assets. As\na component of the\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework,\nwe hold a portion of\nour Liquidity\nResources against the\npotential disruption\nto our secured\nfinancing\ncapabilities. In\ngeneral, we maintain a\npool of liquid and\neasily fundable\nsecurities, which\ntakes into account\nHQLA classifications\nconsistent with LCR\ndefinitions, and other\nregulatory\nrequirements, and\nprovides a valuable\nfuture source of\nliquidity.\nCollateralized\nFinancing Transactions\n                                              \n                          At              At  \n                    December        December  \n  $ in                   31,             31,  \n  millions              2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  purchased                                   \n  under                                       \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  to           $     231,831    $    247,281  \n  resell                                      \n  and                                         \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  borrowed                                    \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  sold                                        \n  under                                       \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  to           $      77,708    $     78,213  \n  repurcha\u2026                                   \n  and                                         \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  loaned                                      \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  received     $       6,219    $      9,954  \n  as                                          \n  collater\u2026                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                    Average                   \n                      Daily                   \n                    Balance                   \n                      Three                   \n                     Months                   \n                      Ended                   \n  $ in             December         December  \n  millions         31, 2023         31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  purchased                                   \n  under                                       \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  to           $    235,928    $     261,627  \n  resell                                      \n  and                                         \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  borrowed                                    \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  sold                                        \n  under                                       \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  to           $     87,285    $      77,268  \n  repurcha\u2026                                   \n  and                                         \n  Securiti\u2026                                   \n  loaned                                      \n                                              \n1.

We\nbelieve that accessing\ndebt investors through\nmultiple distribution\nchannels helps provide\nconsistent access to\nthe unsecured markets.\nIn addition, the\nissuance of borrowings\nwith original\nmaturities greater\nthan one year allows\nus to reduce reliance\non short-term credit-\nsensitive instruments.\nBorrowings with\noriginal maturities\ngreater than one year\nare generally managed\nto achieve staggered\nmaturities, thereby\nmitigating refinancing\nrisk, and to maximize\ninvestor\ndiversification\nthrough sales to\nglobal institutional\nand retail clients\nacross regions,\ncurrencies and product\ntypes. The\navailability and cost\nof financing to us can\nvary depending on\nmarket conditions, the\nvolume of certain\ntrading and lending\nactivities, our credit\nratings and the\noverall availability\nof credit.

Required ratios\nrepresent the\nregulatory minimum\nplus the capital\nbuffer requirement.\nRisk-Weighted Assets.\nRWA reflects both our\non- and off-balance\nsheet risk, as well as\ncapital charges\nattributable to the\nrisk of loss arising\nfrom the following: \u2022\nCredit risk: The\nfailure of a borrower,\ncounterparty or issuer\nto meet its financial\nobligations to us; \u2022\nMarket risk: Adverse\nchanges in the level\nof one or more market\nprices, rates,\nspreads, indices,\nvolatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity;\nand \u2022 Operational\nrisk: Inadequate or\nfailed processes or\nsystems, from human\nfactors or from\nexternal events ( e.g.\n, fraud, theft, legal\nand compliance risks,\ncyber attacks or\ndamage to physical\nassets). Our risk-\nbased capital ratios\nare computed under\neach of (i) the\nStandardized Approach\nand (ii) the Advanced\nApproach. The credit\nrisk RWA calculations\nbetween the two\napproaches differ in\nthat the Standardized\nApproach requires\ncalculation of RWA\nusing prescribed risk\nweights and exposure\nmethodologies, whereas\nthe Advanced Approach\nutilizes models to\ncalculate exposure\namounts and risk\nweights. At December\n31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, the\ndifferences between\nthe actual and\nrequired ratios were\nlower under the\nStandardized Approach.\nLeverage-Based\nRegulatory Capital.\nLeverage-based capital\nrequirements include a\nminimum Tier 1\nleverage ratio of 4%,\na minimum SLR of 3%\nand an enhanced SLR\ncapital buffer of at\nleast 2%.

Advanced\nApproaches. Under the Standardized Approach,\nthe increase was primarily driven by higher\nderivatives, higher securities financing\ntransactions, higher equity investments, as\nwell as an increase in Other credit risk\ndriven by higher deferred tax assets and\nsecuritizations. These increases were\npartially offset by decreases in lending\nactivity. Under the Advanced Approach, the\nincrease was primarily driven by growth in\nCorporate lending, higher equity investments,\nhigher derivatives, as well as increase in\nOther credit risk driven by higher deferred\ntax assets and securitizations. Market risk\nRWA decreased in 2023 under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches,\nprimarily due to lower Regulatory VaR and\nstressed VaR driven by reductions in macro and\ncommodities businesses, partially offset by\nhigher Specific risk charges on securitization\nand non-securitization standardized charges.\nOperational risk RWA in 2023 remained\nrelatively unchanged. G-SIB Capital Surcharge\nWe and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to an\nadditional risk-based capital surcharge, the\nG-SIB capital surcharge, which must be\nsatisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nand which functions as an extension of the\ncapital conservation buffer. The surcharge is\ncalculated based on the G-SIB\u2019s size,\n\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, and complexity and substitutability\n(\u201cMethod 1\u201d) or use of short-term wholesale\nfunding (\u201cMethod 2\u201d), whichever is higher.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt\nand Clean Holding Company Requirements The\nFederal Reserve has established external TLAC,\nlong-term debt (\u201cLTD\u201d) and clean holding\ncompany requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S.\nG-SIBs (\u201ccovered BHCs\u201d), including the Parent\nCompany. These requirements are designed to\nensure that covered BHCs will have enough\nloss-absorbing resources at the point of\nfailure to be recapitalized through the\nconversion of eligible LTD to equity or\notherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD\nor other forms of TLAC where an SPOE\nresolution strategy is used (see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial\nHolding Company\u2014Resolution and Recovery\nPlanning\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory\nand Compliance Risk\u201d). These TLAC and eligible\nLTD requirements include various restrictions,\nsuch as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued\nby the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a\nmaturity of one year or more from the date of\nissuance; and not contain certain embedded\nfeatures, such as a principal or redemption\namount subject to reduction based on the\nperformance of an asset, entity or index, or a\nsimilar feature. In addition, the requirements\nprovide permanent grandfathering for debt\ninstruments issued prior to December 31, 2016\nthat would be eligible LTD but for having\nimpermissible acceleration clauses or being\ngoverned by foreign law. A covered BHC is also\nrequired to maintain minimum external TLAC\nequal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA\nor (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure\n(the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs\nmust also meet a minimum external LTD\nrequirement equal to the greater of (i) total\nRWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the\nhigher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB\ncapital surcharge applicable to the Parent\nCompany or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage\nexposure. TLAC buffer requirements are imposed\non top of both the risk-based and leverage\nexposure-based external TLAC minimum\nrequirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is\nequal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB\nsurcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a\npercentage of total RWA. The leverage\nexposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of\nour total leverage exposure. Failure to\nmaintain the buffers would result in\nrestrictions on our ability to make capital\ndistributions, including the payment of\ndividends and the repurchase of stock, and to\npay discretionary bonuses to executive\nofficers.\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    56  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nRequired and Actual\nTLAC and Eligible LTD\nRatios\n                                              \n                            A\u2026                \n                            A\u2026                \n                            At         At     \n  $\u00a0                        D\u2026        De\u2026     \n  in    R\u2026       Re\u2026        3\u2026        31,     \n  m\u2026    M\u2026       Ra\u2026        2\u2026        20\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  E\u2026                     $  2\u2026     $  24\u2026     \n  T\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     1\u2026  %    21\u2026  %     5\u2026  %     54\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     7\u2026  %    9.5  %     1\u2026  %     17\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                     $  1\u2026     $  15\u2026     \n  L\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     9\u2026  %    9.0  %     3\u2026  %     35\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     4\u2026  %    4.5  %     1\u2026  %     11\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n                                              \n1.

External TLAC consists of Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1\ncapital (each excluding any noncontrolling\nminority interests), as well as eligible LTD.\n3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by\n50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be\npaid in more than one year but less than two\nyears from each respective balance sheet date.\nFurthermore, under the clean holding company\nrequirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from\nincurring any external debt with an original\nmaturity of less than one year or certain\nother liabilities, regardless of whether the\nliabilities are fully secured or otherwise\nsenior to eligible LTD, or entering into\ncertain other prohibited transactions. Certain\nother external liabilities, including those\nwith certain embedded features noted above,\nare subject to a cap equal to 5% of the\ncovered BHC\u2019s outstanding external TLAC\namount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to\nmake certain deductions from regulatory\ncapital for investments in certain unsecured\ndebt instruments (including eligible LTD in\nthe TLAC framework) issued by the Parent\nCompany or other G-SIBs. We are in compliance\nwith all TLAC requirements as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. Capital Plans,\nStress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer The\nFederal Reserve has capital planning and\nstress test requirements for large BHCs, which\nform part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR\nframework. We must submit, on at least an\nannual basis, a capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate annual stress tests designed by us\nand the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal\nReserve may assess our systems and processes\nthat incorporate forward-looking projections\nof revenues and losses to monitor and maintain\nour internal capital adequacy. As banks with\nless than $250 billion of total assets, our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to\ncompany-run stress test regulatory\nrequirements. The capital plan must include a\ndescription of all planned capital actions\nover a nine-quarter planning horizon,\nincluding any issuance or redemption of a debt\nor equity capital instrument, any capital\ndistribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or\nstock repurchases) and any similar action that\nthe Federal Reserve determines could impact\nour consolidated\n\ncapital. The capital plan must include a\ndiscussion of how we will maintain capital\nabove the minimum regulatory capital ratios\nand how we will serve as a source of strength\nto our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under\nsupervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the\nFederal Reserve has issued guidance setting\nout its heightened expectations for capital\nplanning practices at certain large financial\ninstitutions, including us. As part of its\nannual capital supervisory stress testing\nprocess, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB\nfor each large BHC, including us. The SCB\napplies only with respect to Standardized\nApproach risk-based capital requirements and\nreplaced the Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the\ngreater of (i) the maximum decline in our\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the\nseverely adverse scenario over the supervisory\nstress test measurement period plus the sum of\nthe four quarters of planned common stock\ndividends divided by the projected RWAs from\nthe quarter in which the Firm\u2019s projected\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum in the supervisory stress test and\n(ii) 2.5%. The supervisory stress test assumes\nthat BHCs generally maintain a constant level\nof assets and RWAs throughout the projection\nperiod. A firm\u2019s SCB is subject to revision\neach year, taking effect from October 1 to\nreflect the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nannual supervisory stress test. The Federal\nReserve has discretion to recalculate a firm\u2019s\nSCB outside of the October 1 annual cycle and\nto require approval for certain actions, in\nsome circumstances. The Federal Reserve also\nhas the authority to impose restrictions on\ncapital actions as a supervisory matter. For\nthe 2023 capital planning and stress test\ncycle, we submitted our capital plan and\ncompany-run stress test results to the Federal\nReserve on April 5, 2023. On June 28, 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve published summary results\nof its supervisory stress tests of each large\nBHC, in which the projected decline in our\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely\nadverse scenario improved from the prior\nannual supervisory stress test by 50 basis\npoints, from 4.6% to 4.1%. Following the\npublication of the supervisory stress test\nresults, and as a result of the increase in\nour common stock dividend and the resulting\ndividend add-on, we announced that our SCB\nwill be 5.4% from October 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2024. Together with other\nfeatures of the regulatory capital framework,\nthis SCB results in an aggregate Standardized\nApproach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.9%.\nWe also disclosed a summary of the results of\nour company-run stress tests on our Investor\nRelations website and increased our quarterly\ncommon stock dividend to $0.85 per share from\n$0.775, beginning with the common stock\ndividend announced on July 18, 2023.\nAdditionally, our Board of Directors\nreauthorized a multi-year common stock\nrepurchase program of up to $20 billion,\nwithout a set\n                                 \n  57    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nexpiration date,\nbeginning in the third\nquarter of 2023, which\nwill be exercised from\ntime to time as\nconditions warrant.\nAttribution of Average\nCommon Equity\nAccording to the\nRequired Capital\nFramework Our required\ncapital (\u201cRequired\nCapital\u201d) estimation\nis based on the\nRequired Capital\nframework, an internal\ncapital adequacy\nmeasure. Common equity\nattribution to the\nbusiness segments is\nbased on capital usage\ncalculated under the\nRequired Capital\nframework, as well as\neach business\nsegment\u2019s relative\ncontribution to our\ntotal Required\nCapital. The Required\nCapital framework is a\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nmeasure, which is\ncompared with our\nregulatory capital to\nensure that we\nmaintain an amount of\ngoing concern capital\nafter absorbing\npotential losses from\nstress events, where\napplicable, at a point\nin time. The amount of\ncapital allocated to\nthe business segments\nis generally set at\nthe beginning of each\nyear and remains fixed\nthroughout the year\nuntil the next annual\nreset unless a\nsignificant business\nchange occurs (e.g . ,\nacquisition or\ndisposition).

Resolution and Recovery Planning\nWe are required to submit once every two years\nto the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\n(\u201cAgencies\u201d) a resolution plan that describes\nour strategy for a rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in\nthe event of our material financial distress\nor failure. We submitted our 2021 targeted\nresolution plan on June 30, 2021. In November\n2022, we received joint feedback on our 2021\nresolution plan from the Agencies. The\nfeedback indicated that there are no\nshortcomings or deficiencies in our 2021\nresolution plan and that we had successfully\naddressed a prior shortcoming identified by\nthe Agencies in the review of our 2019 full\nresolution plan. We submitted our 2023 full\nresolution plan\n\non June 30, 2023. For more information about\nresolution planning requirements, see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial\nHolding Company\u2014Resolution and Recovery\nPlanning.\u201d As described in our most recent\nresolution plan, our preferred resolution\nstrategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our\nSPOE strategy, the Parent Company has\ntransferred, and has agreed to transfer on an\nongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly\nowned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley\nHoldings LLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition,\nthe Parent Company has entered into an amended\nand restated support agreement with its\nmaterial entities (including the Funding IHC)\nand certain other subsidiaries. In the event\nof a resolution scenario, the Parent Company\nwould be obligated to contribute all of its\ncontributable assets to our supported entities\nand/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would\nbe obligated to provide capital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our supported entities. The\ncombined implication of the SPOE resolution\nstrategy and the requirement to maintain\ncertain levels of TLAC is that losses in\nresolution would be imposed on the holders of\neligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent Company before any losses\nare imposed on creditors of our supported\nentities and without requiring taxpayer or\ngovernment financial support. The obligations\nof the Parent Company and the Funding IHC\nunder the amended and restated support\nagreement are in most cases secured on a\nsenior basis by the assets of the Parent\nCompany (other than shares in subsidiaries of\nthe Parent Company and certain other assets)\nand the assets of the Funding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our supported entities,\nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the\nsecured assets, are effectively senior to\nunsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\nFor more information about resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements and our\nactivities in these areas, including the\nimplications of such activities in a\nresolution scenario, see \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation\u2014Financial Holding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance\nRisk.\u201d Regulatory Developments and Other\nMatters Replacement of London Interbank\nOffered Rate and Replacement or Reform of\nOther Interest Rate Benchmarks Central banks\naround the world, including the Federal\nReserve, have sponsored initiatives in recent\nyears to replace LIBOR and replace or reform\ncertain other interest rate benchmarks\n(collectively, the \u201cIBORs\u201d).

The\nproposal would\nintroduce a new\nmeasure of RWAs known\nas \u201cExpanded Total\nRWAs\u201d (the \u201cExpanded\nApproach\u201d), reflecting\nnew RWA methodologies\nthat generally align\nwith changes to the\nglobal Basel Accord\nadopted by the Basel\nCommittee. The\nproposal would\neliminate the current\ncapital rule\u2019s\nAdvanced Approach and\neffectively replace it\nwith the Expanded\nApproach, which more\nheavily relies on\nstandardized\nmethodologies. As\ncompared with the\nStandardized Approach,\nthe Expanded Approach\nincludes more granular\nrisk weights for\ncredit risk and\nintroduces a new\nmarket risk framework.\nIn addition, unlike\nthe Standardized\nApproach, the Expanded\nApproach\n\nincludes operational\nrisk and credit\nvaluation adjustment\nRWA components.\n\nThe Basel III Endgame\nProposal, if adopted\nas a final rule, would\nmaintain the current\ncapital rule\u2019s dual-\nrequirement structure,\nwhereby we and our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\nwould be required to\ncalculate our risk-\nbased capital ratios\nunder both the\nExpanded Approach and\nthe Standardized\nApproach. In addition,\nthe proposal would\nmodify the\nStandardized Approach\nby requiring that the\nnew market risk\nstandards from the\nproposal also be\napplied in the\nStandardized Approach.\n\nThe Basel III Endgame\nProposal would apply\nthe SCB and G-SIB\nsurcharge to risk-\nbased capital\nrequirements\ncalculated under both\nthe Expanded Approach\nand the Standardized\nApproach. The proposal\nincludes a proposed\neffective date of\n\nJuly 1, 2025, with\nthree-year transition\narrangements until\nrevised standards are\nfully phased in on\nJuly 1, 2028.\n\nBased on our current\nunderstanding of the\nBasel III Endgame\nProposal, we estimate\nthat, if the Expanded\nApproach had applied\non a fully phased-in\nbasis as of December\n31, 2023, and in the\nabsence of taking any\nactions to mitigate\nits impact, our\nExpanded Approach RWAs\nas of that date would\nhave been\napproximately 40%\nhigher than our actual\nStandardized Approach\nRWAs as of that date.\n\nThe increase in RWAs\nresulting from the\nExpanded Approach\nwould result, assuming\nall other surcharge\nelements remained\nunchanged, in a lower\nSCB and lower G-SIB\nMethod 2 surcharge as\ncompared with current\nsurcharges, as RWAs\nare included in the\ndenominators of the\nrelevant calculations\nfor each buffer. Lower\nsurcharges would,\ntherefore, partially\ndecrease the otherwise\nhigher regulatory\ncapital requirements\nunder the Expanded\nApproach. The proposal\nwould phase in the\nhigher Expanded\nApproach RWAs on July\n1 of each year during\nthe transition,\nthereby increasing our\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, with\ndelayed incorporation\nof the potentially\nlower SCB and G-SIB\nMethod 2 capital\nsurcharge\ncalculations.\n\nAny estimate of how\nthe Expanded Approach\nmay impact us is a\nforward-looking\nstatement and subject\nto uncertainty, as\nactual results may\ndiffer from the\nanticipated results\nand may be materially\naffected by and\ndependent on a range\nof factors, including\nbusiness performance,\nfuture capital\nactions, the results\nof future supervisory\nstress tests, and\npotential\nmodifications to the\nproposal by the U.S.\nbanking agencies in a\nfinal rulemaking.

This\nphilosophy is\nimplemented through\nthe ERM framework.\nFive key principles\nunderlie this\nphilosophy: integrity,\ncomprehensiveness,\nindependence,\naccountability and\ntransparency. To help\nensure the efficacy of\nrisk management, which\nis an essential\ncomponent of our\nreputation, senior\n\nmanagement requires\nthorough and frequent\nreporting and the\nappropriate escalation\nof risk matters. The\nfast-paced, complex\nand constantly\nevolving nature of\nglobal financial\nmarkets requires us to\nmaintain a risk\nmanagement culture\nthat is incisive,\nknowledgeable about\nspecialized products\nand markets, and\nsubject to ongoing\nreview and\nenhancement.\n\nOur risk appetite\ndefines the aggregate\nlevel and types of\nrisk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept to\nachieve its business\nobjectives, taking\ninto account the\ninterests of clients\nand fiduciary duties\nto shareholders, as\nwell as capital and\nother regulatory\nrequirements. This\nrisk appetite is\nembedded in our risk\nculture and linked to\nour short-term and\nlong-term strategic,\ncapital and financial\nplans, as well as\ncompensation programs.\nThis risk appetite and\nthe related Board-\nlevel risk limits and\nrisk tolerance\nstatements are\nreviewed and approved\nby the BRC and the\nBoard on at least an\nannual basis.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance Structure                   \n                                              \nRisk management at the\nFirm requires\nindependent Firm-level\noversight,\naccountability of our\nbusiness divisions,\nand effective\ncommunication of risk\nmatters across the\nFirm, to senior\nmanagement and\nultimately to the\nBoard.

For\nexample, the Global\nIncentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy sets\nforth standards for\nmanagers when making\nannual compensation\ndecisions and\nspecifically provides\nthat managers must\nconsider whether their\nemployees effectively\nmanaged and/or\nsupervised risk\ncontrol practices\nduring the performance\nyear.

These\nresults are\nincorporated into\nidentified employees\u2019\nperformance reviews\nand compensation and\npromotion decisions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s clawback\nand cancellation\nprovisions apply to\ndeferred incentive\ncompensation and cover\na broad scope of\nemployee conduct,\nincluding any act or\nomission (including\nwith respect to direct\nsupervisory\nresponsibilities) that\nconstitutes a breach\nof obligation to the\nFirm or causes a\nrestatement of the\nFirm\u2019s financial\nresults, constitutes a\nviolation of the\nFirm\u2019s global risk\nmanagement principles,\npolicies and\nstandards, or causes a\nloss of revenue\nassociated with a\nposition on which the\nemployee was paid and\nthe employee operated\noutside of risk\nmanagement policies.\n                                              \n  Risk Limits Framework                       \n                                              \nRisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nprovide the basis for\nmonitoring risk-taking\nactivity and avoiding\noutsized risk taking.\nOur risk-taking\ncapacity is sized\nthrough the Firm\u2019s\ncapital planning\nprocess where losses\nare estimated under\nthe Firm\u2019s BHC\nSeverely Adverse\nstress testing\nscenario. We also\nmaintain a\ncomprehensive suite of\nrisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nto support and\nimplement our risk-\nappetite statement.\nOur risk limits\nsupport linkages\nbetween the overall\nrisk appetite, which\nis reviewed by the\nBoard, and more\ngranular risk-taking\ndecisions and\nactivities.\n\nRisk limits, once\nestablished, are\nreviewed and updated\non at least an annual\nbasis, with more\nfrequent updates as\nnecessary.

However,\nthe analyses used to\nassess such risks are\nnot predictions of\nfuture events, and\nactual results may\nvary significantly\nfrom such analyses due\nto events in the\nmarkets in which we\noperate and certain\nother factors\ndescribed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk refers to\nthe risk that a change\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, spreads,\nindices, volatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity,\nwill result in losses\nfor a position or\nportfolio. Generally,\nwe incur market risk\nas a result of\ntrading, investing and\nclient facilitation\nactivities,\nprincipally within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment where the\nsubstantial majority\nof our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is\ngenerated. In\naddition, we incur\nnon-trading market\nrisk, principally\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments. The\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\n(including interest\nrate risk) from\nlending and deposit-\ntaking activities. The\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\nfrom capital\ninvestments in its\nfunds.\n\nMarket risk also\nincludes non-trading\ninterest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest\nrate risk in the\nbanking book (amounts\nclassified for\nregulatory capital\npurposes under the\nbanking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure\nthat a change in\ninterest rates will\nresult in prospective\nearnings changes for\nassets and liabilities\nin the banking book.\n\nSound market risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nculture. The various\nbusiness units and\ntrading desks are\nresponsible for\nensuring that market\nrisk exposures are\nwell-managed and\nprudent. The control\ngroups help ensure\nthat these risks are\nmeasured and closely\nmonitored and are made\ntransparent to senior\nmanagement. The Market\nRisk Department is\nresponsible for\nensuring the\ntransparency of\nmaterial market risks,\nmonitoring compliance\nwith established\nlimits and escalating\nrisk concentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nMarket Risk Department\nmonitors our risk\nagainst limits on\naggregate risk\nexposures, performs a\nvariety of risk\nanalyses, routinely\nreports risk\nsummaries, and\nmaintains our VaR and\nscenario analysis\nsystems. Market risk\nis also monitored\nthrough various\nmeasures: by use of\nstatistics (including\nVaR and related\nanalytical measures),\nby measures of\nposition size and\nsensitivity, and\nthrough routine stress\ntesting, which\nmeasures the impact on\nthe value of existing\nportfolios of\nspecified changes in\nmarket factors and\nscenarios designed by\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment in\ncollaboration with the\nbusiness units. The\nmaterial risks\nidentified by these\nprocesses are\nsummarized in reports\nproduced by the Market\nRisk\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    64  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nDepartment that are\ncirculated to and\ndiscussed with senior\nmanagement, the FRC,\nthe BRC and the Board.\n                                              \n  Trading Risks                               \n                                              \n                                              \n   Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market   \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nWe have exposures to a\nwide range of risks\nrelated to interest\nrates and credit\nspreads, equity\nprices, foreign\nexchange rates and\ncommodity prices as\nwell as the associated\nimplied volatilities,\ncorrelations and\nspreads of the global\nmarkets in which we\nconduct our trading\nactivities.\n\nWe are exposed to\ninterest rate and\ncredit spread risk as\na result of our\nmarket-making\nactivities and other\ntrading in interest\nrate-sensitive\nfinancial instruments\n(i.e., risk arising\nfrom changes in the\nlevel or implied\nvolatility of interest\nrates, the timing of\nmortgage prepayments,\nthe shape of the yield\ncurve and/or credit\nspreads).

Commodity\nexposures are subject\nto periods of high\nprice volatility as a\nresult of changes in\nsupply and demand.\nThese changes can be\ncaused by weather\nconditions, physical\nproduction and\ntransportation, or\ngeopolitical and other\nevents that affect the\navailable supply and\nlevel of demand for\nthese commodities.\n\nWe manage our trading\npositions by employing\na variety of risk-\nmitigation strategies.\nThese strategies\ninclude\ndiversification of\nrisk exposures and\nhedging. Hedging\nactivities consist of\nthe purchase or sale\nof positions in\nrelated securities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products\n(e.g., futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions). Hedging\nactivities may not\nalways provide\neffective mitigation\nagainst trading losses\ndue to differences in\nthe\n\nterms, specific\ncharacteristics or\nother basis risks that\nmay exist between the\nhedge instrument and\nthe risk exposure that\nis being hedged.\n\nWe manage the market\nrisk associated with\nour trading activities\non a Firmwide basis,\non a worldwide trading\ndivision level and on\nan individual product\nbasis.

The Market\nRisk Department\ncalculates and\ndistributes daily VaR-\nbased risk measures to\nvarious levels of\nmanagement.\n\nWe estimate VaR using\na model based on a\none-year equal-\nweighted historical\nsimulation for general\nmarket risk factors\nand name-specific risk\nin corporate equities\nand related\nderivatives, and Monte\nCarlo simulation for\nname-specific risk in\nbonds, loans and\nrelated derivatives.\nThe model constructs a\ndistribution of\nhypothetical daily\nchanges in the value\nof trading portfolios\nbased on historical\nobservation of daily\nchanges in key market\nindices or other\nmarket risk factors,\nand information on the\nsensitivity of the\nportfolio values to\nthese market risk\nfactor changes.\n\nVaR for risk\nmanagement purposes\n(\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95%\nlevel of confidence\nover a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a\nuseful indicator of\npossible trading\nlosses resulting from\nadverse daily market\nmoves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the\nunrealized loss in\nportfolio value that,\nbased on historically\nobserved market risk\nfactor movements,\nwould have been\nexceeded with a\nfrequency of 5%, or\nfive times in every\n100 trading days, if\nthe portfolio were\nheld constant for one\nday.\n\nOur VaR model\ngenerally takes into\naccount linear and\nnon-linear exposures\nto equity and\ncommodity price risk,\ninterest rate risk,\ncredit spread risk and\nforeign exchange\nrates. The model also\ntakes into account\nlinear exposures to\nimplied volatility\nrisks for all asset\nclasses and non-linear\nexposures to implied\nvolatility risks for\nequity, commodity and\nforeign exchange\nreferenced products.\nThe VaR model also\ncaptures certain\nimplied correlation\nrisks associated with\nportfolio credit\nderivatives, as well\nas certain basis risks\n(e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit\nderivatives).\n                                 \n  65    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nWe use VaR as one of a\nrange of risk\nmanagement tools.\nAmong their benefits,\nVaR models permit\nestimation of a\nportfolio\u2019s aggregate\nmarket risk exposure,\nincorporating a range\nof varied market risks\nand portfolio assets.\nOne key element of the\nVaR model is that it\nreflects risk\nreduction due to\nportfolio\ndiversification or\nhedging activities.\nHowever, VaR has\nvarious limitations,\nwhich include, but are\nnot limited to: use of\nhistorical changes in\nmarket risk factors,\nwhich may not be\naccurate predictors of\nfuture market\nconditions and may not\nfully incorporate the\nrisk of extreme market\nevents that are\noutsized relative to\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior or\nreflect the historical\ndistribution of\nresults beyond the 95%\nconfidence interval;\nand reporting of\nlosses in a single\nday, which does not\nreflect the risk of\npositions that cannot\nbe liquidated or\nhedged in one day. A\nsmall proportion of\nmarket risk generated\nby trading positions\nis not included in\nVaR. The modeling of\nthe risk\ncharacteristics of\nsome positions relies\non approximations\nthat, under certain\ncircumstances, could\nproduce significantly\ndifferent results from\nthose produced using\nmore precise measures.\nVaR is most\nappropriate as a risk\nmeasure for trading\npositions in liquid\nfinancial markets and\nwill understate the\nrisk associated with\nsevere events, such as\nperiods of extreme\nilliquidity. We are\naware of these and\nother limitations and,\ntherefore, use VaR as\nonly one component in\nour risk management\noversight process.\nThis process also\nincorporates stress\ntesting and scenario\nanalyses and extensive\nrisk monitoring,\nanalysis and control\nat the trading desk,\ndivision and Firm\nlevels. We update our\nVaR model in response\nto changes in the\ncomposition of trading\nportfolios and to\nimprovements in\nmodeling techniques\nand systems\ncapabilities. We are\ncommitted to\ncontinuous review and\nenhancement of VaR\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in order\nto capture evolving\nrisks associated with\nchanges in market\nstructure and\ndynamics. As part of\nour regular process\nimprovements,\nadditional systematic\nand name-specific risk\nfactors may be added\nto improve the VaR\nmodel\u2019s ability to\nmore accurately\nestimate risks to\nspecific asset classes\nor industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR\nstatistics are\nestimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR\nshould not be viewed\nas predictive of our\nfuture revenues or\nfinancial performance\nor of our ability to\nmonitor and manage\nrisk. There can be no\nassurance that our\nactual losses on a\nparticular day will\nnot exceed the VaR\namounts indicated in\nthe following tables\nor that such losses\nwill not occur more\nthan five times in 100\ntrading days for a\n95%/one-day VaR. VaR\ndoes not predict the\nmagnitude of losses\nthat, should they\noccur, may be\nsignificantly greater\nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not\nreadily comparable\nacross firms because\nof differences in the\nfirms\u2019 portfolios,\nmodeling assumptions\nand methodologies.\nThese differences can\nresult in materially\ndifferent VaR\nestimates across firms\nfor similar\nportfolios. The impact\nof such differences\nvaries depending on\nthe factor history\nassumptions, the\nfrequency with which\nthe factor\n\nhistory is updated and\nthe confidence level.\nAs a result, VaR\nstatistics are more\nuseful when\ninterpreted as\nindicators of trends\nin a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile rather than as\nan absolute measure of\nrisk to be compared\nacross firms. Our\nregulators have\napproved the same VaR\nmodel we use for risk\nmanagement purposes\nfor use in regulatory\ncalculations. The\nportfolio of positions\nused for Management\nVaR differs from that\nused for Regulatory\nVaR.

The market risk related to these\ninvestments is measured by estimating the\npotential reduction in net revenues associated\nwith a reasonably possible 10% decline in\ninvestment values and related impact on\nperformance-based income, as applicable. Asset\nManagement Revenue Sensitivity Certain asset\nmanagement revenues in the Wealth Management\nand Investment Management business segments\nare derived from management fees, which are\nbased on fee-based client assets in Wealth\nManagement or AUM in Investment Management\n(together, \u201cclient holdings\u201d). The assets\nunderlying client holdings are primarily\ncomposed of equity, fixed income and\nalternative investments and are sensitive to\nchanges in related markets. These revenues\ndepend on multiple factors including, but not\nlimited to, the level and duration of a market\nincrease or decline, price volatility, the\ngeographic and industry mix of client assets,\nand client behavior such as the rate and\nmagnitude of client investments and\nredemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may\nnot correlate completely with changes in the\nrelated markets. Credit Risk Credit risk\nrefers to the risk of loss arising when a\nborrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet\nits financial obligations to us. We are\nprimarily exposed to credit risk from\ninstitutions and individuals through our\nInstitutional Securities and Wealth Management\nbusiness segments. We incur credit risk in our\nInstitutional Securities business segment\nthrough a variety of activities, including,\nbut not limited to, the following: \u2022 extending\ncredit to clients through loans and lending\ncommitments; \u2022 entering into swap or other\nderivative contracts under which\ncounterparties may have obligations to make\npayments to us; \u2022 acting as clearing broker\nfor listed and over-the-counter derivatives\nwhereby we guarantee client performance to\nclearinghouses;\n\n\u2022 providing short- or long-term funding that\nis secured by physical or financial\ncollateral, including, but not limited to,\nreal estate and marketable securities, whose\nvalue may at times be insufficient to fully\ncover the repayment amount; \u2022 posting margin\nand/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing\nagencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms\nand other financial counterparties; \u2022 placing\nfunds on deposit at other financial\ninstitutions to support our clearing and\nsettlement obligations; and \u2022 investing or\ntrading in securities and loan pools, whereby\nthe value of these assets may fluctuate based\non realized or expected defaults on the\nunderlying obligations or loans. We incur\ncredit risk in our Wealth Management business\nsegment, primarily through lending to\nindividuals and entities, including, but not\nlimited to, the following: \u2022 margin loans\ncollateralized by securities; \u2022 securities-\nbased lending and other forms of secured\nloans, including tailored lending to ultra-\nhigh net worth clients, that are in most cases\nsecured by various types of collateral,\nincluding marketable securities, private\ninvestments, commercial real estate and other\nfinancial assets; \u2022 single-family residential\nmortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming\nor HELOC form, primarily to existing Wealth\nManagement clients; and \u2022 employee loans\ngranted primarily to recruit certain Wealth\nManagement representatives. Monitoring and\nControl The Credit Risk Management Department\n(\u201cCRM\u201d) establishes Firmwide practices to\nevaluate, monitor and control credit risk at\nthe transaction, obligor and portfolio levels.\nThe CRM approves extensions of credit,\nevaluates the creditworthiness of the\ncounterparties and borrowers on a regular\nbasis, and helps ensure that credit exposure\nis actively monitored and managed. The\nevaluation of counterparties and borrowers\nincludes an assessment of the probability that\nan obligor will default on its financial\nobligations and any losses that may occur when\nan obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk\nexposure is actively managed by credit\nprofessionals and committees within the CRM\nand through various risk committees, whose\nmembership includes individuals from the CRM.\nA comprehensive and global Credit Limits\nFramework is utilized to manage credit risk\nlevels across the Firm. The Credit Limits\nFramework is calibrated within our risk\ntolerance and includes single-name limits and\nportfolio concentration limits by country,\nindustry and product type. The CRM helps\nensure timely and transparent communication of\nmaterial credit risks, compliance with\nestablished limits and escalation of risk\nconcentrations to appropriate senior\nmanagement. The CRM also works closely with\nthe Market Risk Department and applicable\nbusiness units to monitor risk exposures and\nto perform stress tests to identify, analyze\nand control credit risk concentrations arising\nfrom lending and trading activities. The\nstress tests shock market factors (e.g . ,\ninterest rates, commodity prices, credit\nspreads), risk\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    68  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nparameters (e.g. ,\nprobability of default\nand loss given\ndefault), recovery\nrates and expected\nlosses in order to\nassess the impact of\nstresses on exposures,\nprofit and loss, and\nour capital position.\nStress tests are\nconducted in\naccordance with our\nestablished policies\nand procedures. Credit\nEvaluation The\nevaluation of\ncorporate and\ninstitutional\ncounterparties and\nborrowers includes\nassigning credit\nratings, which reflect\nan assessment of an\nobligor\u2019s probability\nof default and loss\ngiven default. Credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the assessment\nof financial\nstatements; leverage;\nliquidity; capital\nstrength; asset\ncomposition and\nquality; market\ncapitalization; access\nto capital markets;\nadequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable; and, in\nthe case of certain\nloans, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements.\nThe CRM also evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, management\nand other factors such\nas country risks and\nlegal and contingent\nrisks that could\naffect the obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile.\nAdditionally, the CRM\nevaluates the relative\nposition of our\nexposure in the\nborrower\u2019s capital\nstructure and relative\nrecovery prospects, as\nwell as other\nstructural elements of\nthe particular\ntransaction. The\nunderwriting of\ncommercial real estate\nloans includes, but is\nnot limited to, review\nof the property type,\nLTV ratio, occupancy\nlevels, debt service\nratio, prevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\nThe evaluation of\nconsumer borrowers is\ntailored to the\nspecific type of\nlending. Securities-\nbased loans are\nevaluated based on\nfactors that include,\nbut are not limited\nto, the amount of the\nloan and the amount,\nquality,\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. The\nunderwriting of\nresidential real\nestate loans includes,\nbut is not limited to,\nreview of the\nobligor\u2019s debt-to-\nincome ratio, net\nworth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand industry standard\ncredit-scoring models\n(e.g., FICO scores).\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nindividual loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level, and\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis. Credit\nrisk metrics assigned\nto our borrowers\nduring the evaluation\nprocess are\nincorporated into the\nCRM maintenance of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Such allowance\nserves as a reserve\nfor expected inherent\nlosses, as well as\nexpected losses\nrelated to loans\nidentified as\nimpaired. For more\ninformation on the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, see Notes 2\nand 9 to the financial\nstatements. Risk\nMitigation We may seek\nto mitigate credit\nrisk from our lending\nand trading activities\nin multiple ways,\nincluding collateral\nprovisions, guarantees\nand hedges. At the\ntransaction level, we\nseek to mitigate risk\nthrough management of\nkey risk elements such\nas size, tenor,\nfinancial covenants,\nseniority and\ncollateral. We\nactively hedge our\nlending and\nderivatives exposures.\nHedging activities\nconsist of the\npurchase or sale of\npositions in related\nsecurities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products\n(e.g., futures,\n\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).\nAdditionally, we may\nsell, assign or\nsyndicate loans and\nlending commitments to\nother financial\ninstitutions in the\nprimary and secondary\nloan markets. In\nconnection with our\nderivatives trading\nactivities, we\ngenerally enter into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral\narrangements with\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide us\nwith the ability to\ndemand collateral, as\nwell as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset\nreceivables and\npayables covered under\nthe same master\nagreement in the event\nof a counterparty\ndefault. A collateral\nmanagement group\nmonitors collateral\nlevels against\nrequirements and\noversees the\nadministration of the\ncollateral function.\nSee Note 8 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\ntransactions.

and\nResidential real\nestate loans.\nSecurities-based\nlending allows clients\nto borrow money\nagainst the value of\nqualifying securities,\ngenerally for any\npurpose other than\npurchasing, trading or\ncarrying securities or\nrefinancing margin\ndebt. We establish\napproved credit lines\n\nagainst qualifying\nsecurities and monitor\nlimits daily and,\npursuant to such\nguidelines, require\ncustomers to deposit\nadditional collateral,\nor reduce debt\npositions, when\nnecessary. These\ncredit lines are\nprimarily uncommitted\nloan facilities, as we\nreserve the right not\nto make any advances\nor may terminate these\ncredit lines at any\ntime. Factors\nconsidered in the\nreview of these loans\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the loan\namount, the client\u2019s\ncredit profile, the\ndegree of leverage,\ncollateral\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. Other\nloans primarily\ninclude tailored\nlending, which\ntypically consist of\nbespoke lending\narrangements provided\nto ultra-high net\nworth clients.\nSecurities-based\nlending and Other\nloans are generally\nsecured by various\ntypes of eligible\ncollateral, including\nmarketable securities,\nprivate investments,\ncommercial real estate\nand other financial\nassets. Residential\nreal estate loans\nconsist of first- and\nsecond-lien mortgages,\nincluding HELOCs. Our\nunderwriting policy is\ndesigned to ensure\nthat all borrowers\npass an assessment of\ncapacity and\nwillingness to pay,\nwhich includes an\nanalysis utilizing\nindustry standard\ncredit scoring models\n(e.g., FICO scores),\ndebt-to-income ratios\nand assets of the\nborrower. LTV ratios\nare determined based\non independent third-\nparty property\nappraisals and\nvaluations, and\nsecurity lien\npositions are\nestablished through\ntitle and ownership\nreports. The vast\nmajority of mortgage\nloans, including\nHELOCs, are held for\ninvestment in the\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\u2019s\nloan portfolio.

Amounts may\nfluctuate from period\nto period as overall\nclient balances change\nas a result of market\nlevels, client\npositioning and\nleverage. Credit\nexposures arising from\nmargin lending\nactivities are\ngenerally mitigated by\ntheir short-term\nnature, the value of\ncollateral held and\nour right to call for\nadditional margin when\ncollateral values\ndecline. However, we\ncould incur losses in\nthe event that the\ncustomer fails to meet\nmargin calls and\ncollateral values\ndecline below the loan\namount. This risk is\nelevated in loans\nbacked by collateral\npools with significant\nconcentrations in\nindividual issuers or\nsecurities with\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics.

Examples\nwhere this applies may\ninclude corporations\nthat are incorporated\nin one country but\nthat derive the bulk\nof their revenue from\nanother and mutual\nfunds incorporated in\none jurisdiction but\nwith a concentration\nof investments in a\ndifferent country.\n\nIn addition to the\ndirect country risk\nreflected in the \u201cTop\n10 Non-U.S. Country\nExposures\u201d table\nbelow, we also have\nindirect country\nexposure, for example,\nfrom collateral\nreceived in secured\nfinancing transactions\nor from providing\nclient clearing\nservices. These\nindirect exposures are\nmanaged through the\ncredit and market risk\nframeworks.\n\nWe conduct periodic\nstress testing that\nseeks to measure the\nimpact on our credit\nand market exposures\nof shocks stemming\nfrom negative economic\nor political\nscenarios. When deemed\nappropriate by our\nrisk managers, the\nstress test scenarios\ninclude possible\ncontagion effects and\nsecond order risks.\nThis analysis, and\nresults of the stress\ntests, may result in\nthe amendment of\nlimits or exposure\nmitigation.\n\nOur sovereign\nexposures consist of\nfinancial contracts\nand obligations\nentered into with\nsovereign and local\ngovernments. Our non-\nsovereign exposures\nconsist of financial\ncontracts and\nobligations entered\ninto primarily with\ncorporations and\nfinancial\ninstitutions.\n\nIndex credit\nderivatives are\nincluded in the\nfollowing \u201cTop 10\nNon-U.S. Country\nExposures\u201d table.

Index\nexposures are\nallocated to the\nunderlying reference\nentities in proportion\nto the notional\nweighting of each\nreference entity in\nthe index, adjusted\nfor any fair value\nreceivable or payable\nfor that reference\nentity. Where credit\nrisk crosses multiple\njurisdictions, for\nexample, a CDS\npurchased from an\nissuer in a specific\ncountry that\nreferences bonds\nissued by an entity in\na different country,\nthe fair value of the\nCDS is reflected in\nthe Net counterparty\nexposure row based on\nthe country of the CDS\nissuer.

Primarily\nconsists of cash and\ngovernment obligations\nof the countries\nlisted. Operational\nRisk Operational risk\nrefers to the risk of\nloss, or of damage to\nour reputation,\nresulting from\ninadequate or failed\nprocesses or systems,\nfrom human factors or\nfrom external events\n(e.g . , cyberattacks\nor third-party\nvulnerabilities) that\nmay manifest as, for\nexample, loss of\ninformation, business\ndisruption, theft and\nfraud, legal and\ncompliance risks, or\ndamage to physical\nassets. We may incur\noperational risk\nacross the full scope\nof our business\nactivities, including\nrevenue-generating\nactivities and support\nand control groups\n(e.g . , IT and trade\nprocessing). We have\nestablished an\noperational risk\nframework to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and\ncontrol risk across\nthe Firm. Effective\noperational risk\nmanagement is\nessential to reducing\nthe impact of\noperational risk\nincidents and\nmitigating legal,\nregulatory and\nreputational risks.\nThe framework is\ncontinually evolving\nto account for changes\nin the Firm and to\nrespond to the\nchanging regulatory\nand business\nenvironment. We have\nimplemented\noperational risk data\nand assessment systems\nto monitor and analyze\ninternal and external\noperational risk\nevents, to assess\nbusiness environment\nand internal control\nfactors, and to\nperform scenario\nanalysis. The\ncollected data\nelements are\nincorporated in the\noperational risk\ncapital model. The\nmodel encompasses both\nquantitative and\nqualitative elements.\nInternal loss data and\nscenario analysis\nresults are direct\ninputs to the capital\nmodel, while external\noperational incidents,\nbusiness environment\nand internal control\nfactors are evaluated\nas part of the\nscenario analysis\nprocess. In addition,\nwe employ a variety of\nrisk processes and\nmitigants to manage\nour operational risk\nexposures. These\ninclude a governance\nframework, a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement program and\ninsurance. Operational\nrisks and associated\nrisk exposures are\nassessed relative to\nthe risk appetite\nreviewed and confirmed\nby the Board and are\nprioritized\naccordingly. The\nbreadth and range of\noperational risk are\nsuch that the types of\nmitigating activities\nare wide-ranging.\nExamples of activities\ninclude: continuous\nenhancement of\ndefenses against\ncyberattacks, use of\nlegal agreements and\ncontracts to transfer\nand/or limit\noperational risk\nexposures, due\ndiligence,\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    76  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nimplementation of\nenhanced policies and\nprocedures, technology\nchange management\ncontrols, exception\nmanagement processing\ncontrols, and\nsegregation of duties.\n\nPrimary responsibility\nfor the management of\noperational risk is\nwith the business\nsegments, the control\ngroups and the\nbusiness managers\ntherein. The business\nmanagers maintain\nprocesses and controls\ndesigned to identify,\nassess, manage,\nmitigate and report\noperational risk. Each\nof the business\nsegments has a\ndesignated operational\nrisk coordinator. The\noperational risk\ncoordinator regularly\nreviews operational\nrisk issues and\nreports to our senior\nmanagement within each\nbusiness. Each control\ngroup also has a\ndesignated operational\nrisk coordinator and a\nforum for discussing\noperational risk\nmatters with our\nsenior management.\nOversight of\noperational risk is\nprovided by the Non-\nFinancial Risk\nCommittee, legal\nentity risk\ncommittees, regional\nrisk committees and\nsenior management. In\nthe event of a merger,\njoint venture,\ndivestiture,\nreorganization, or\ncreation of a new\nlegal entity, a new\nproduct, or a business\nactivity, operational\nrisks are considered,\nand any necessary\nchanges in processes\nor controls are\nimplemented.\n\nThe Operational Risk\nDepartment provides\nindependent oversight\nof operational risk\nand assesses, measures\nand monitors\noperational risk\nagainst appetite. The\nOperational Risk\nDepartment works with\nthe divisions and\ncontrol groups to\nembed a transparent,\nconsistent and\ncomprehensive\nframework for managing\noperational risk\nwithin each area and\nacross the Firm.\n\nThe Operational Risk\nDepartment scope\nincludes oversight of\ntechnology risk,\ncybersecurity risk,\ninformation security\nrisk, the fraud risk\nmanagement and\nprevention program,\nand third-party risk\nmanagement (supplier\nand affiliate risk\noversight and\nassessment), among\nothers.\n                                              \n  Cybersecurity                               \n                                              \nFor a discussion of\nour Cybersecurity\nProgram, see\n\u201cCybersecurity.\u201d\n                                              \n  Firm Resilience                             \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s critical\nprocesses and\nbusinesses could be\ndisrupted by events\nincluding\ncyberattacks, failure\nor loss of access to\ntechnology and/or\nassociated data,\nmilitary conflicts,\nacts of terror,\nnatural disasters,\nsevere weather events\nand infectious\ndisease.

The\ntolerance is based on\nan assessment of the\nmateriality of the\nrisk of financial loss\nor reputational damage\ndue to errors in\ndesign, implementation\nand/or inappropriate\nuse of models. The\ntolerance is monitored\nthrough model-specific\nand aggregate\nbusiness-level\nassessments, which are\nbased upon qualitative\nand quantitative\nfactors.\n\nThe effective\nchallenge of models\nconsists of critical\nanalysis by objective,\ninformed parties who\ncan identify model\nlimitations and\nassumptions and drive\nappropriate changes.\nThe MRM provides\neffective challenge of\nmodels, independently\nvalidates and approves\nmodels for use,\nannually recertifies\nmodels, periodically\nrevalidates,\nidentifies and tracks\nremediation plans for\nmodel limitations and\nreports on model risk\nmetrics.

Our Equity\nand Fixed Income businesses include sales,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, market-making,\nAsia wealth management services and certain\nbusiness-related investments. Lending\nactivities include originating corporate loans\nand commercial real estate loans, providing\nsecured lending facilities, and extending\nsecurities-based and other financing to\ncustomers. Other activities include research.\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive\narray of financial services and solutions to\nindividual investors and small to medium-sized\nbusinesses and institutions covering:\nfinancial advisor-led brokerage, custody,\nadministrative and investment advisory\nservices; self-directed brokerage services;\nfinancial and wealth planning services;\nworkplace services, including stock plan\nadministration; securities-based lending,\nresidential real estate loans and other\nlending products; banking; and retirement plan\nservices. Investment Management provides a\nbroad range of investment strategies and\nproducts that span geographies, asset classes,\nand public and private markets to a diverse\ngroup of clients across institutional and\nintermediary channels. Strategies and\nproducts, which are offered through a variety\nof investment vehicles, include equity, fixed\nincome, alternatives and solutions, and\nliquidity and overlay services. Institutional\nclients include defined benefit/defined\ncontribution plans, foundations, endowments,\ngovernment entities, sovereign wealth funds,\ninsurance companies, third-party fund sponsors\nand\n\ncorporations. Individual clients are generally\nserved through intermediaries, including\naffiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\nBasis of Financial Information The financial\nstatements are prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make\nestimates and assumptions regarding the\nvaluations of certain financial instruments,\nthe valuations of goodwill and intangible\nassets, the outcome of legal and tax matters,\ndeferred tax assets, ACL, and other matters\nthat affect its financial statements and\nrelated disclosures. The Firm believes that\nthe estimates utilized in the preparation of\nits financial statements are prudent and\nreasonable. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates. The Notes are\nan integral part of the Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent\nevents for adjustment to or disclosure in\nthese financial statements through the date of\nthis report and has not identified any\nrecordable or disclosable events not otherwise\nreported in these financial statements or the\nnotes thereto. Consolidation The financial\nstatements include the accounts of the Firm,\nits wholly owned subsidiaries and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest, including certain VIEs\n(see Note 15). Intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. For\nconsolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly\nowned, the third-party holdings of equity\ninterests are referred to as Noncontrolling\ninterests. The net income attributable to\nNoncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries\nis presented as Net income applicable to\nnoncontrolling interests in the income\nstatement. The portion of shareholders\u2019 equity\nthat is attributable to Noncontrolling\ninterests for such subsidiaries is presented\nas Noncontrolling interests, a component of\nTotal equity, in the balance sheet. For\nentities where the total equity investment at\nrisk is sufficient to enable the entity to\nfinance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support and the equity\nholders bear the residual economic risks and\nreturns of the entity and have the power to\ndirect the activities of the entity that most\nsignificantly affect its economic performance,\nthe Firm consolidates those entities it\ncontrols either through a majority voting\ninterest or otherwise. For VIEs (i.e.,\nentities that do not meet the aforementioned\ncriteria), the Firm consolidates those\nentities where it has the power to make the\ndecisions that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the VIE and has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. For investments in\nentities in which the Firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest but has\nsignificant influence over operating and\nfinancial decisions, it applies the equity\nmethod of accounting with net gains and losses\nrecorded within Other\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    86  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nrevenues (see Note 11)\nunless the Firm has\nelected to measure the\ninvestment at fair\nvalue, in which case\nnet gains and losses\nare recorded within\nInvestments revenues\n(see Note 5). Equity\nand partnership\ninterests held by\nentities qualifying\nfor accounting\npurposes as investment\ncompanies are carried\nat fair value. The\nFirm\u2019s significant\nregulated U.S. and\ninternational\nsubsidiaries include:\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley & Co.\nLLC (\u201cMS&Co.\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Smith\nBarney LLC (\u201cMSSB\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Europe\nSE (\u201cMSESE\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley & Co.\nInternational plc\n(\u201cMSIP\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Capital\nServices LLC (\u201cMSCS\u201d),\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley\nCapital Group Inc.\n(\u201cMSCG\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley MUFG\nSecurities Co., Ltd.\n(\u201cMSMS\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cMSBNA\u201d) and \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Private Bank,\nNational Association\n(\u201cMSPBNA\u201d). For\nfurther information on\nthe Firm\u2019s significant\nregulated U.S. and\ninternational\nsubsidiaries, see Note\n16.\n                                              \n  2. Significant Accounting Policies          \n                                              \nRevenue Recognition Revenues are recognized\nwhen the promised goods or services are\ndelivered to our customers in an amount that\nis based on the consideration the Firm expects\nto receive in exchange for those goods or\nservices when such amounts are not probable of\nsignificant reversal. Investment Banking\nRevenues from investment banking activities\nconsist of revenues earned from underwriting,\nprimarily equity and fixed income securities\nand loan syndications, and advisory fees,\nprimarily for mergers, acquisitions and\nrestructurings. Underwriting revenues are\ngenerally recognized on trade date if there is\nno uncertainty or contingency related to the\namount to be paid. Underwriting costs are\ndeferred and recognized in the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line items when the related\nunderwriting revenues are recorded. Advisory\nfees are recognized as advice is provided to\nthe client, based on the estimated progress of\nwork and when revenues are not probable of a\nsignificant reversal. Advisory costs are\nrecognized as incurred in the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line items, including those\nreimbursed. Commissions and Fees Commission\nand fee revenues generally result from\ntransaction-based arrangements in which the\nclient is charged a fee for the execution of\ntransactions. Such revenues primarily arise\nfrom transactions in equity securities;\nservices\n\nrelated to sales and trading activities; and\nsales of mutual funds, alternative funds,\nfutures, insurance products and options, as\nwell as revenues from order flow payments for\ndirecting customer orders to broker-dealers,\nexchanges and market centers for execution.\nCommission and fee revenues are recognized on\ntrade date when the performance obligation is\nsatisfied. Asset Management Revenues Asset\nmanagement, distribution and administration\nfees are generally based on related asset\nlevels, such as the AUM of a customer\u2019s\naccount or the net asset value of a fund.\nThese fees are generally recognized when\nservices are performed and the value of the\nassets is known. Management fees are reduced\nby estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if\nany, provided to the customer. Performance-\nbased fees not in the form of carried interest\nare recorded when the annual performance\ntarget is met and the revenues are not\nprobable of a significant reversal. Sales\ncommissions paid by the Firm in connection\nwith the sale of certain classes of shares of\nits open-end mutual fund products are\naccounted for as deferred commission assets\nand amortized to Other expenses over the\nexpected life of the contract. The Firm\nperiodically tests deferred commission assets\nfor recoverability based on cash flows\nexpected to be received in future periods.\nOther asset management and distribution costs\nare recognized as incurred in the relevant\nnon-interest expenses line items. Investments\nRevenues\u2014Carried Interest The Firm is entitled\nto receive performance-based fees in the form\nof carried interest when the return in certain\nfunds exceeds specified performance targets.\nWhen the Firm earns carried interest from\nfunds as specified performance thresholds are\nmet, that carried interest and any related\ngeneral or limited partner interest are\naccounted for under the equity method of\naccounting and measured based on the Firm\u2019s\nclaim on the NAV of the fund at the reporting\ndate, taking into account the distribution\nterms applicable to the interest held. Such\nitems are reflected within Investments\nrevenues. See Note 22 for information\nregarding the net cumulative unrealized amount\nof performance-based fee revenues at risk of\nreversal. See Note 14 for information\nregarding general partner guarantees, which\ninclude potential obligations to return\nperformance fee distributions previously\nreceived. Other Items Revenues from certain\ncommodities-related contracts are recognized\nin Trading revenues when the Firm has\ntransferred control over the promised goods or\nservices to the customer. Receivables from\ncontracts with customers are recognized in\nCustomer and other receivables in the balance\nsheet when the\n                                 \n  87    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nunderlying performance obligations have been\nsatisfied and the Firm has the right per the\ncontract to bill the customer. Contract assets\nare recognized in Other assets when the Firm\nhas satisfied its performance obligations but\ncustomer payment is conditional on something\nother than the passage of time. Contract\nliabilities are recognized in Other\nliabilities and accrued expenses when the Firm\nhas collected payment from a customer based on\nthe terms of the contract but the underlying\nperformance obligations are not yet satisfied.\nFor contracts with a term of less than one\nyear, incremental costs to obtain the contract\nare expensed as incurred. Revenues are not\ndiscounted when payment is expected within one\nyear. The Firm generally presents, net within\nrevenues, taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and\nconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing\ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a\ncustomer. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and\ncash equivalents consist of Cash and due from\nbanks and Interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid\ninvestments with remaining maturities of three\nmonths or less from the acquisition date that\nare readily convertible to cash and are not\nheld for trading purposes. Cash and cash\nequivalents also include Restricted cash, such\nas cash segregated in compliance with federal\nor other regulations, including minimum\nreserve requirements set by the Federal\nReserve Bank and other central banks, and the\nFirm\u2019s initial margin deposited with clearing\norganizations. Fair Value of Financial\nInstruments Instruments within Trading assets\nand Trading liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue, either as required or allowed by\naccounting guidance. These financial\ninstruments primarily represent the Firm\u2019s\ntrading and investment positions and include\nboth cash and derivative products. In\naddition, securities classified as Available-\nfor-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) are measured at fair value.\nGains and losses on instruments carried at\nfair value are reflected in Trading revenues,\nInvestments revenues or Investment banking\nrevenues in the income statement, except for\ngains and losses related to AFS securities\n(see \u201cAFS Investment Securities\u201d section\nherein and Note 7) and derivatives accounted\nfor as hedges, as well as economic derivative\nhedges associated with certain held-for-sale\nand held-for-investment corporate loans and\nlending commitments (see \u201cHedge Accounting\u201d\nand \u201cOther Hedges\u201d herein and Note 6).\nInterest income and interest expense are\nrecorded within the income statement depending\non the nature of the instrument and related\nmarket conventions. When interest is included\nas a component of the instruments\u2019 fair value,\ninterest is recorded within Trading revenues\nor Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is\nrecorded within Interest income or Interest\nexpense. Dividend income is recorded in\nTrading revenues or Investments revenues\ndepending on the business activity. The fair\nvalue of OTC financial instruments, including\nderivative contracts related to financial\ninstruments and commodities, is presented in\nthe accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis, when appropriate.\nAdditionally, the Firm nets the fair value of\ncash collateral paid or received against the\nfair value amounts recognized for net\nderivative positions executed with the same\ncounterparty under the same master netting\nagreement. Fair Value Option The Firm has\nelected to measure certain eligible\ninstruments at fair value, including\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, Loans and lending commitments, equity\nmethod investments and certain other assets,\nDeposits, Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, Other secured financings and\nBorrowings. Fair Value Measurement\u2014Definition\nand Hierarchy Fair value is defined as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability (i.e ., the\n\u201cexit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is a market-based measure\nconsidered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific\nmeasure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available,\nassumptions are set to reflect those that the\nFirm believes market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date. Where the Firm manages a\ngroup of financial assets, financial\nliabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted\nfor as derivatives on the basis of its net\nexposure to either market risks or credit\nrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that\ngroup of financial instruments consistently\nwith how market participants would price the\nnet risk exposure at the measurement date. In\ndetermining fair value, the Firm uses various\nvaluation approaches and establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue that requires the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are\ninputs that market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability that were\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from\nsources independent of the Firm. Unobservable\ninputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the\nFirm believes other market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability that are\ndeveloped based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value\nhierarchy is broken down into three levels\nbased on the observability of inputs as\nfollows, with Level 1 being the highest and\nLevel 3 being the lowest level:\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    88  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nLevel 1. Valuations based on quoted prices in\nactive markets that the Firm has the ability\nto access for identical assets or liabilities.\nValuation adjustments, block discounts and\ndiscounts for entity-specific and contractual\nrestrictions that would not transfer to market\nparticipants are not applied to Level 1\ninstruments. Since valuations are based on\nquoted prices that are readily and regularly\navailable in an active market, valuation of\nthese products does not entail a significant\ndegree of judgment. Level 2. Valuations based\non quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets, quoted prices\nfor identical or similar assets or liabilities\nin inactive markets, significant market inputs\nother than quoted prices that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, or market-\ncorroborated inputs. Level 3. Valuations based\non inputs that are unobservable and\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. The availability of observable\ninputs can vary from product to product and is\naffected by a wide variety of factors,\nincluding the type of product, whether the\nproduct is new and not yet established in the\nmarketplace, the liquidity of markets and\nother characteristics particular to the\nproduct. To the extent that valuation is based\non models or inputs that are less observable\nor unobservable in the market, the\ndetermination of fair value requires more\njudgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment\nexercised by the Firm in determining fair\nvalue is greatest for instruments categorized\nin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The\nFirm considers prices and inputs that are\ncurrent as of the measurement date, including\nduring periods of market dislocation. In\nperiods of market dislocation, the\nobservability of prices and inputs may be\nreduced for many instruments. This condition\ncould cause an instrument to be reclassified\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue may fall into different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total\nfair value amount is disclosed in the level\nappropriate for the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the total fair value of the\nasset or liability. Valuation Techniques Many\ncash instruments and OTC derivative contracts\nhave bid and ask prices that can be observed\nin the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the\nhighest price that a party is willing to pay\nfor an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest\nprice that a party is willing to accept for an\nasset. The Firm carries positions at the point\nwithin the bid-ask range that meets its best\nestimate of fair value. For offsetting\npositions in the same financial instrument,\nthe same price within the bid-ask spread is\nused to measure both the long and short\npositions. Fair value for many cash\ninstruments and OTC derivative contracts is\nderived using pricing models. Pricing models\ntake into account the contract terms, as well\nas multiple inputs, including, where\napplicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves,\ncorrelation, creditworthiness of the\ncounterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm,\noption volatility and currency rates. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty, and concentration risk and\nfunding in order to arrive at fair value.\nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-\nderived mid-market amounts of Level 2 and\nLevel 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid\nor mid-ask spread required to properly reflect\nthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and\nmid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed\nin trade activity, broker quotes or other\nexternal third-party data. Where these spreads\nare unobservable for the particular position\nin question, spreads are derived from\nobservable levels of similar positions. The\nFirm applies credit-related valuation\nadjustments to its Borrowings for which the\nfair value option was elected and to OTC\nderivatives. The Firm considers the impact of\nchanges in its own credit spreads based upon\nobservations of the secondary bond market\nspreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings. For OTC derivatives, which are\nrecognized in Trading assets at fair value in\nthe balance sheet, the impact of changes in\nboth the Firm\u2019s and the counterparty\u2019s credit\nrating is considered when measuring fair\nvalue. In determining the expected exposure,\nthe Firm simulates the distribution of the\nfuture exposure to a counterparty, then\napplies market-based default probabilities to\nthe future exposure, leveraging external\nthird-party CDS spread data. Where CDS spread\ndata are unavailable for a specific\ncounterparty, bond market spreads, CDS spread\ndata based on the counterparty\u2019s credit rating\nor CDS spread data that reference a comparable\ncounterparty may be utilized. The Firm also\nconsiders collateral held and legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that\nmitigate its exposure to each counterparty.\nAdjustments for model uncertainty are taken\nfor positions whose underlying models are\nreliant on significant inputs that are neither\ndirectly nor indirectly observable, hence\nrequiring reliance on established theoretical\nconcepts in their derivation. These\nadjustments are derived by making assessments\nof the possible degree of variability using\nstatistical approaches and market-based\ninformation where possible. The Firm may apply\nconcentration adjustments to certain of its\nOTC derivative portfolios to reflect the\nadditional cost of closing out a particularly\nlarge risk exposure. Where possible, these\nadjustments are based on observable market\ninformation, but in many instances,\nsignificant judgment is required to estimate\nthe costs of closing out concentrated risk\nexposures due to the lack of liquidity in the\nmarketplace. The Firm applies an FVA in the\nfair value measurements of OTC\nuncollateralized or partially collateralized\nderivatives\n                                 \n  89    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nand in collateralized derivatives where the\nterms of the agreement do not permit the reuse\nof the collateral received. In general, FVA\nreflects a market funding risk premium\ninherent in the noted derivative instruments.\nThe methodology for measuring FVA leverages\nthe Firm\u2019s existing credit-related valuation\nadjustment calculation methodologies, which\napply to both assets and liabilities. See Note\n4 for a description of valuation techniques\napplied to the major categories of financial\ninstruments measured at fair value. Assets and\nLiabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-\nrecurring Basis Certain of the Firm\u2019s assets\nand liabilities are measured at fair value on\na non-recurring basis. The Firm incurs losses\nor gains for any adjustments of these assets\nor liabilities to fair value. For assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis, fair value is determined by\nusing various valuation approaches. The same\nhierarchy for inputs as described above, which\nrequires that observable inputs be used when\navailable, is used in measuring fair value for\nthese items. For further information on\nfinancial assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis, see Note 4. Offsetting of\nDerivative Instruments In connection with its\nderivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and\ncollateral agreements with its counterparties.\nThese agreements provide the Firm with the\nright, in the event of a default by the\ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under the agreement and to\nliquidate and set off cash collateral against\nany net amount owed by the counterparty.\nDerivatives with enforceable master netting\nagreements are reported net of cash collateral\nreceived and posted. However, in certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may not have such an\nagreement in place; the relevant insolvency\nregime may not support the enforceability of\nthe master netting agreement or collateral\nagreement; or the Firm may not have sought\nlegal advice to support the enforceability of\nthe agreement. In cases where the Firm has not\ndetermined an agreement to be enforceable, the\nrelated amounts are not offset (see Note 6).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash\nand/or securities posted as collateral (with\nrights of rehypothecation) in connection with\nderivative transactions, irrespective of the\nenforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In\ncertain cases, the Firm may agree for such\ncollateral to be posted by the counterparty to\na third-party custodian under a control\nagreement that enables it to take control of\nsuch collateral in the event of a counterparty\ndefault. The enforceability of the master\nnetting agreement is taken into account in the\nFirm\u2019s risk management practices and\napplication of counterparty credit limits. For\ninformation related to offsetting of\nderivatives, see Note 6. Hedge Accounting The\nFirm applies hedge accounting using various\nderivative financial instruments for the\nfollowing types of hedges: hedges of changes\nin the fair value of assets and liabilities\ndue to the risk being hedged (fair value\nhedges); hedges of variability in forecasted\ncash flows from floating-rate assets due to\ncontractually specified interest rates (cash\nflow hedges) and hedges of net investments in\nforeign operations whose functional currency\nis different from the reporting currency of\nthe Parent Company (net investment hedges).\nThese financial instruments are included\nwithin Trading assets\u2014Derivative and other\ncontracts or Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative\nand other contracts in the balance sheet. For\nhedges where hedge accounting is being\napplied, the Firm performs effectiveness\ntesting and other procedures. The change in\nthe fair value of the designated portion of\nthe hedging instrument should be highly\ncorrelated, between 80and 125percent of the\nchange in the fair value, cash flows, or\ncarrying value (due to translation gains or\nlosses) of the hedged item attributable to the\nrisk being hedged. The Firm considers the\nimpact of valuation adjustments related to\ncounterparty credit spreads and its own credit\nspreads to determine whether they would cause\nthe hedging relationship to be ineffective.\nFair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk The\nFirm\u2019s designated fair value hedges consist of\ninterest rate swaps designated as hedges of\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate of\ncertain fixed rate AFS securities and senior\nborrowings. The Firm also designates interest\nrate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate of certain fixed\nrate deposits. The Firm is permitted to hedge\nthe full, or part of the contractual term of\nthe hedged instrument. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to perform an ongoing\nprospective and retrospective assessment of\nthe effectiveness of these hedging\nrelationships. For qualifying fair value\nhedges of benchmark interest rates, the change\nin the fair value of the derivative, offset by\nthe change in the fair value attributable to\nthe change in the benchmark interest rate risk\nof the hedged asset (liability), is recognized\nin earnings each period as a component of\nInterest income (expense). For AFS securities,\nthe change in fair value of the hedged item\ndue to changes other than the risk being\nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI.\nWhen a derivative is de-designated as a hedge,\nany basis adjustment remaining on the hedged\nasset (liability) is amortized to Interest\nincome (expense) over the remaining life of\nthe asset (liability) using the effective\ninterest method.\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    90  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Firm uses forward\nforeign exchange\ncontracts to manage a\nportion of the\ncurrency exposure\nrelating to its net\ninvestments in foreign\noperations. To the\nextent that the\nnotional amounts of\nthe hedging\ninstruments equal the\nportion of the\ninvestments being\nhedged and the\nunderlying exchange\nrate of the derivative\nhedging instrument is\nthe same as the\nexchange rate between\nthe functional\ncurrency of the\ninvestee and the\nintermediate parent\nentity\u2019s functional\ncurrency, it is\nconsidered to be\nperfectly effective.\nThe gain or loss from\nrevaluing hedges of\nnet investments in\nforeign operations at\nthe spot rate is\nreported within AOCI.\nThe forward points on\nthe hedging\ninstruments are\nexcluded from hedge\neffectiveness testing\nand changes in the\nfair value of this\nexcluded component are\nrecorded currently in\nInterest income. Cash\nFlow Hedges\u2014Interest\nRate Risk The Firm\u2019s\ndesignated cash flow\nhedges consist of\ninterest rate\nderivatives designated\nas hedges of\nvariability in\nforecasted cash flows\nfrom floating-rate\nassets due to changes\nin the contractually\nspecified interest\nrates. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to\nperform an ongoing\nprospective and\nretrospective\nassessment of the\neffectiveness of these\nhedging relationships.\nThe objective of this\nstrategy is to hedge\nthe risk of changes in\nthe hedged item\u2019s cash\nflows attributable to\nchanges in the\ncontractually\nspecified interest\nrate. For qualifying\ncash flow hedges of\ncontractually\nspecified interest\nrates, changes in the\nfair value of the\nderivative are\nrecorded in OCI and\nsubsequently\nreclassified to\nearnings in the same\nperiods when the\nhedged item affects\nearnings. If cash flow\nhedge accounting is\ndiscontinued, AOCI is\nreleased into earnings\nimmediately if the\ncash flow of the\nhedged item is\nprobable of not\noccurring. Otherwise\nthe amount in AOCI is\nreleased into earnings\nas the forecasted\ntransaction affects\nearnings. Other Hedges\nIn addition to hedges\nthat are designated\nand qualify for hedge\naccounting, the Firm\nuses derivatives to\neconomically hedge\ncredit risk associated\nwith certain held-for-\nsale and held-for-\ninvestment corporate\nloans and lending\ncommitments, and the\nrelated gains and\nlosses are reported\nwithin Other revenues\nin the income\nstatement. For further\ninformation on\nderivative instruments\nand hedging\nactivities, see Note\n6. AFS Investment\nSecurities AFS\nsecurities are\nreported at fair value\nin the balance sheet.\nInterest income,\nincluding amortization\nof premiums and\naccretion of\ndiscounts, is included\nin Interest income in\nthe income statement.\nUnrealized gains are\nrecorded in OCI, and\n\nunrealized losses are\nrecorded either in OCI\nor in Other revenues\nas described below.\nAFS securities in an\nunrealized loss\nposition are first\nevaluated to determine\nwhether there is an\nintent to sell or it\nis more likely than\nnot the Firm will be\nrequired to sell\nbefore recovery of the\namortized cost basis.\nIf so, the amortized\ncost basis is written\ndown to the fair value\nof the security such\nthat the entire\nunrealized loss is\nrecognized in Other\nrevenues, and any\npreviously established\nACL is written off.\nFor all other AFS\nsecurities in an\nunrealized loss\nposition, any portion\nof unrealized losses\nrepresenting a credit\nloss is recognized in\nOther revenues and as\nan increase to the ACL\nfor AFS securities,\nwith the remainder of\nunrealized losses\nrecognized in OCI. A\ncredit loss exists if\nthe Firm does not\nexpect to recover the\namortized cost basis\nof the security. When\nconsidering whether a\ncredit loss exists,\nthe Firm considers\nrelevant information,\nincluding: \u2022\nguarantees (implicit\nor explicit) by the\nU.S. government; \u2022 the\nextent to which the\nfair value has been\nless than the\namortized cost basis;\n\u2022 adverse conditions\nspecifically related\nto the security, its\nindustry or geographic\narea; \u2022 changes in the\nfinancial condition of\nthe issuer of the\nsecurity or, in the\ncase of an asset-\nbacked debt security,\nchanges in the\nfinancial condition of\nthe underlying loan\nobligors; \u2022 the\npayment structure of\nthe debt security and\nthe likelihood of the\nissuer being able to\nmake payments that\nincrease in the\nfuture; \u2022 failure of\nthe issuer of the\nsecurity to make\nscheduled interest or\nprincipal payments; \u2022\nthe current rating and\nany changes to the\nrating of the security\nby a rating agency. If\na credit loss exists,\nthe Firm measures the\ncredit loss as the\ndifference between the\npresent value of cash\nflows expected to be\ncollected (discounted\nat the implicit\ninterest rate at\nacquisition of the\nsecurity or discounted\nat the effective yield\nfor securities that\nincorporate changes in\nprepayment\nassumptions) and the\namortized cost basis\nof the security.\nChanges in prepayment\nassumptions alone are\nnot considered to\nresult in a credit\nloss. When estimating\nthe present value of\nexpected cash flows,\ninformation utilized\nincludes the remaining\npayment terms of the\nsecurity, prepayment\nspeeds, financial\ncondition of the\nissuer, expected\ndefaults and the value\nof any underlying\ncollateral.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                Provision     \n                 ACL            for           \n                                Credit        \n                                Losses        \n  AFS            Contra         Other         \n  securities     investment     revenue       \n                 securities                   \n                                              \n                                 \n  91    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNonaccrual & ACL Charge-offs on AFS Securities\nAFS securities follow the same nonaccrual and\ncharge-off guidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d herein. HTM Securities HTM\nsecurities are reported at amortized cost, net\nof any ACL, in the balance sheet. Refer to\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein for\nguidance on the ACL determination. Interest\nincome, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on HTM securities, is\nincluded in Interest income in the income\nstatement. Loans The Firm accounts for loans\nbased on the following categories: loans held\nfor investment; loans held for sale; and loans\nat fair value. Nonaccrual and ACL Charge-offs\non Loans All loan categories described below\nfollow the same nonaccrual and charge-off\nguidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein. Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment are reported at\namortized cost, which consists of the\noutstanding principle balance adjusted for any\ncharge-offs, the allowance for credit losses,\nany unamortized deferred fees or costs for\noriginated loans, and any unamortized premiums\nor discounts for purchased loans. Interest\nIncome. Interest income on performing loans\nheld for investment is accrued and recognized\nas interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or\npremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or\ncosts, are amortized into interest income over\nthe life of the loan to produce a level rate\nof return. Lending Commitments. The Firm\nrecords the liability and related expense for\nthe credit exposure related to commitments to\nfund loans. The liability is recorded in Other\nLiabilities in the balance sheet and the\nexpense is recorded in the Provision for\ncredit losses in the income statement. For\nmore information regarding loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, see Note 14. For more information\nregarding allowance for credit losses, refer\nto \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein. Loans\nHeld for Sale Loans held for sale are measured\nat the lower of amortized cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes recorded in Other\nrevenues. The Firm determines the valuation\nallowance on an individual loan basis, except\nfor residential mortgage loans for which the\nvaluation allowance is determined at the loan\nproduct level. Any decreases in fair value\nbelow the initial carrying amount and any\nrecoveries in fair value up to the initial\ncarrying amount are recorded in Other\nrevenues. Increases in fair value above\ninitial carrying value are not recognized.\nInterest Income. Interest income on loans held\nfor sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums are deferred as an\nadjustment to the loan\u2019s cost basis until the\nrelated loan is sold and, as such, are\nincluded in the periodic determination of the\nlower of cost or fair value adjustments and\nthe gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Lending Commitments. Commitments to fund\nmortgage loans held for sale are derivatives\nand are reported in Trading assets or Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheet and in\nTrading revenues in the income statement. For\ncommitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the\nFirm records the liability and related expense\nfor the fair value exposure below cost of such\ncommitments in Other liabilities and accrued\nexpenses in the balance sheet with an offset\nto Other revenues in the income statement.\nBecause loans and lending commitments held for\nsale are recognized at the lower of cost or\nfair value, the allowance for credit losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these\nloans. Loans at Fair Value Loans for which the\nfair value option is elected are carried at\nfair value and included in Trading assets in\nthe balance sheet, with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings. For further\ninformation on loans carried at fair value and\nclassified as Trading assets, see Note 4.\nLending Commitments. The Firm records the\nliability and related expense for the fair\nvalue exposure related to commitments to fund\nloans that will be measured at fair value. The\nliability is recorded in Trading liabilities\nin the balance sheet, and the expense is\nrecorded in Trading revenues in the income\nstatement. Because such loans and lending\ncommitments are reported at fair value, the\nallowance for credit losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. For\nfurther information on loans, see Note 9. For\nmore information regarding loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, see Note 14. Allowance for Credit\nLosses The ACL for financial instruments\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures (e.g ., HFI loans and\nlending commitments, HTM securities, customer\nand other receivables and certain guarantees)\nrepresents an\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    92  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nestimate of expected\ncredit losses over the\nentire life of the\nfinancial instrument.\nFactors considered by\nmanagement when\ndetermining the ACL\ninclude payment\nstatus, fair value of\ncollateral and\nexpected payments of\nprincipal and\ninterest, as well as\ninternal or external\ninformation relating\nto past events,\ncurrent conditions,\nand reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\nThe Firm uses three\nforecasts that include\nassumptions about\ncertain macroeconomic\nvariables, including,\nbut not limited to,\nU.S. gross domestic\nproduct (\u201cGDP\u201d),\nequity market indices\nand unemployment\nrates, as well as\ncommercial real estate\nand home price\nindices. At the\nconclusion of the\nFirm\u2019s reasonable and\nsupportable forecast\nperiod of 13 quarters,\nthere is a gradual\nreversion back to\nhistorical averages.\nThe ACL is measured on\na collective basis\nwhen similar risk\ncharacteristics exist\nfor multiple\ninstruments,\nconsidering all\navailable information\nrelevant to assessing\nthe collectability of\ncash flows. Generally,\nthe Firm applies a\nprobability of\ndefault/loss given\ndefault model for\ninstruments that are\ncollectively assessed,\nunder which the ACL is\ncalculated as the\nproduct of probability\nof default, loss given\ndefault and exposure\nat default. These\nparameters are\nforecast for each\ncollective group of\nassets using a\nscenario-based\nstatistical model. If\nthe instrument does\nnot share similar risk\ncharacteristics with\nother instruments,\nincluding when it is\nprobable that the Firm\nwill be unable to\ncollect the full\npayment of principal\nand interest on the\ninstrument when due,\nthe ACL is measured on\nan individual basis.\nThe Firm generally\napplies a discounted\ncash flow method for\ninstruments that are\nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also\nelect to use an\napproach that\nconsiders the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral when\nmeasuring the ACL if\nthe loan is collateral\ndependent (i.e .,\nrepayment of the loan\nis expected to be\nprovided substantially\nby the sale or\noperation of the\nunderlying collateral\nand the borrower is\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm\ncan elect to use an\napproach to measure\nthe ACL that considers\nthe fair value of\ncollateral where the\nborrower is required\nto, and reasonably\nexpected to,\ncontinually adjust and\nreplenish the amount\nof collateral securing\nthe instrument to\nreflect changes in the\nfair value of such\ncollateral. The Firm\nhas elected to use\nthis approach for\ncertain securities-\nbased loans, margin\nloans, securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell\nand securities\nborrowed. Credit\nquality indicators\nconsidered in\ndeveloping the ACL\ninclude: \u2022 Corporate\nloans, secured lending\nfacilities, commercial\nreal estate loans and\nsecurities, and other\nloans: Internal risk\nratings developed by\nthe CRM that are\nrefreshed at least\nannually, and more\nfrequently as\nnecessary. These\nratings\n\ngenerally correspond\nto external ratings\npublished by S&P. The\nFirm also considers\ntransaction structure,\nincluding type of\ncollateral, collateral\nterms and position of\nthe obligation within\nthe capital structure.\nIn addition, for\ncommercial real\nestate, the Firm\nconsiders property\ntype and location, net\noperating income and\nLTV ratios, among\nother factors, as well\nas commercial real\nestate price and\ncredit spread indices\nand capitalization\nrates. \u2022 Residential\nreal estate loans:\nLoan origination Fair\nIsaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores\nas determined by\nindependent credit\nagencies in the U.S.\nand LTV ratios. \u2022\nEmployee loans:\nEmployment status,\nwhich includes those\ncurrently employed by\nthe Firm and for which\nthe Firm can deduct\nany unpaid amounts due\nto it through certain\ncompensation\narrangements; and\nthose no longer\nemployed by the Firm\nwhere such\narrangements are no\nlonger applicable.\nQualitative and\nenvironmental factors\nsuch as economic and\nbusiness conditions,\nthe nature and volume\nof the portfolio, and\nlending terms and the\nvolume and severity of\npast due loans are\nalso considered in the\nACL calculations.\nPresentation of ACL\nand Provision for\nCredit Losses\n                                              \n                                 Provision    \n                 ACL             for          \n                                 Credit       \n                                 Losses       \n  Held for                       Provision    \n  investment     Contra asset    for credit   \n  loans                          losses       \n  Other                                       \n  instruments                                 \n  measured at                                 \n  amortized                                   \n  cost                           Other        \n  (e.g.,HTM      Contra asset    revenues     \n  securities                                  \n  and                                         \n  customer                                    \n  and other                                   \n  receivable\u2026                                 \n                                 Compensati\u2026  \n  Employee       Contra asset    and          \n  loans                          benefits     \n                                 expenses     \n  Held for       Other           Provision    \n  investment     liabilities     for credit   \n  lending        and accrued     losses       \n  commitments    expenses                     \n  Other                                       \n  off-balance    Other                        \n  sheet          liabilities     Other        \n  instruments    and accrued     expenses     \n  (e.g.,cert\u2026    expenses                     \n  guarantees)                                 \n                                              \nNonaccrual The Firm\nplaces financial\ninstruments on\nnonaccrual status if\nprincipal or interest\nis not expected when\ncontractually due or\nis past due for a\nperiod of 90 days or\nmore unless the\nobligation is well-\nsecured and is in the\nprocess of collection.\nFor any instrument\nplaced on nonaccrual\nstatus, the Firm\nreverses any unpaid\ninterest accrued with\nan offsetting\nreduction to Interest\nincome. Principal and\ninterest payments\nreceived on nonaccrual\ninstruments are\napplied to principal\nif there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate\ncollectability of\nprincipal. If\ncollection of the\nprincipal is not in\ndoubt, interest income\nis realized on a cash\nbasis. If the\ninstrument is brought\ncurrent and neither\nprincipal nor interest\ncollection is in\ndoubt, instruments can\ngenerally return to\naccrual status, and\ninterest income can be\nrecognized. ACL\nCharge-offs The\nprincipal balance of a\nfinancial instrument\nis charged off in the\nperiod it is deemed\nuncollectible,\nresulting in a\nreduction in the ACL\nand in the balance of\nthe financial\ninstrument in the\nbalance sheet. Accrued\ninterest receivable\n                                 \n  93    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nbalances that are separately recorded from the\nrelated financial instruments are charged off\nagainst Interest income when the related\nfinancial instrument is placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Accordingly, the Firm elected not to\nmeasure an ACL for accrued interest\nreceivables. Transfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted\nfor as sales when the Firm has relinquished\ncontrol over the transferred assets. Any\nrelated gain or loss on sale is recorded in\nNet revenues. Transfers that are not accounted\nfor as sales are treated as collateralized\nfinancings. Securities borrowed or purchased\nunder agreements to resell and securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to repurchase\nare treated as collateralized financings (see\nNote 8). Securities purchased under agreements\nto resell (\u201creverse repurchase agreements\u201d)\nand Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase (\u201crepurchase agreements\u201d),\nincluding repurchase and reverse repurchase\nagreements-to-maturity, are carried in the\nbalance sheet at the amount of cash paid or\nreceived plus accrued interest except for\ncertain reverse repurchase and repurchase\nagreements for which the Firm has elected the\nfair value option (see Note 5). Where\nappropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse\nrepurchase agreements with the same\ncounterparty are reported on a net basis.\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned are\nrecorded at the amount of cash collateral\nadvanced or received. In instances where the\nFirm is the lender in securities-for-\nsecurities transactions and is permitted to\nsell or repledge these securities, the fair\nvalue of the collateral received is reported\nin Trading assets, and the related obligation\nto return the collateral is reported in\nTrading liabilities in the balance sheet.\nSecurities-for-securities transactions where\nthe Firm is the borrower are not included in\nthe balance sheet. In order to manage credit\nexposure arising from these transactions, in\nappropriate circumstances, the Firm enters\ninto master netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with its counterparties. These\nagreements provide the Firm with the right, in\nthe event of a default by the counterparty, to\nnet a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations\nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set\noff collateral held by the Firm against the\nnet amount owed by the counterparty. The\nFirm\u2019s policy is generally to take possession\nof securities purchased or borrowed in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed transactions,\nrespectively, and to receive cash and/or\nsecurities delivered under repurchase\nagreements or securities loaned transactions\n(with rights of rehypothecation). For\ninformation related to offsetting of certain\ncollateralized transactions, see Note 8.\nPremises, Equipment\nand Capitalized\nSoftware Costs\nPremises, equipment\nand capitalized\nsoftware costs consist\nof buildings,\nleasehold\nimprovements,\nfurniture, fixtures,\ncomputer and\ncommunications\nequipment, power\ngeneration assets and\ncapitalized software\n(externally purchased\nand developed for\ninternal use).\nPremises, equipment\nand capitalized\nsoftware costs are\nstated at cost less\naccumulated\ndepreciation and\namortization and are\nincluded in Other\nassets in the balance\nsheet.

The Firm\ntests indefinite-lived\nintangible assets for\nimpairment at the\naggregate level of\nmanagement contracts.\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, the\nFirm has the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case, the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, the\nFirm compares the fair\nvalue with the\ncarrying amount. If\nthe fair value is less\nthan the carrying\namount, the impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited to the\ncarrying amount. The\nestimated fair values\nare derived based on\nvaluation techniques\nthe Firm believes\nmarket participants\nwould use. The\nestimated fair values\nare generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology\nor methodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncertain comparable\ncompanies for goodwill\nimpairment testing.\n                                 \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    94  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nIntangible assets with a finite life are\namortized over their estimated useful life and\nare reviewed for impairment on an interim\nbasis when impairment indicators are present.\nImpairment losses are recorded within Other\nexpenses in the income statement. Earnings per\nCommon Share Basic EPS is computed by dividing\nearnings available to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period.\nEarnings available to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders represents net income applicable\nto Morgan Stanley reduced by preferred stock\ndividends. Common shares outstanding include\ncommon stock and vested RSUs where recipients\nhave satisfied the relevant vesting terms.\nDiluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of\nall dilutive securities. Share-based awards\nthat pay dividend equivalents subject to\nvesting are included in diluted shares\noutstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury\nstock method. The Firm has granted PSUs that\nvest and convert to shares of common stock\nonly if predetermined performance and market\ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the PSUs are included in\ndiluted EPS based on the number of shares (if\nany) that would be issuable if the reporting\ndate was the end of the performance period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings\n(loss) per common share, see Note 17 to the\nfinancial statements. Deferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation The Firm measures\ncompensation expense for stock-based awards at\nfair value. The Firm determines the fair value\nof RSUs (including PSUs with non-market\nperformance conditions) based on the grant-\ndate fair value of its common stock, measured\nas the volume-weighted average price on the\ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs\nnot entitled to dividends until conversion is\nmeasured at VWAP reduced by the present value\nof dividends expected to be paid on the\nunderlying shares prior to scheduled\nconversion date. PSUs that contain market-\nbased conditions are valued using a Monte\nCarlo valuation model. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nCompensation expense for awards with\nperformance conditions is recognized based on\nthe probable outcome of the performance\ncondition at each reporting date. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market-based\nconditions is recognized irrespective of the\nprobability of the market condition being\nachieved and is not reversed if the market\ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards\ngenerally contain clawback and cancellation\nprovisions. Certain awards provide the Firm\ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a\nportion of the award under specified\ncircumstances. Where award terms are\nconsidered to be subjective, a grant date\ncannot be established and the awards are\nsubject to variable accounting which requires\nthat compensation expense for those awards is\nadjusted for changes in the fair value of the\nFirm\u2019s common stock or the relevant model\nvaluation, as appropriate, until conversion,\nexercise or expiration. Following amendments\nto clarify specific subjective award terms in\nthe second quarter of 2023, a grant date for\nthe awards was established such that\ncompensation expense for those awards is no\nlonger adjusted for changes in the fair value\nof the Firm\u2019s common stock. The Firm also\noperates an Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(\u201cESPP\u201d) which allows eligible employees of\nthe Firm to purchase shares of Morgan Stanley\nat a discount. Employee Stock Trusts In\nconnection with certain stock-based\ncompensation plans, the Firm has established\nemployee stock trusts to provide, at its\ndiscretion, common stock voting rights to\ncertain RSU holders. Following the grant of an\nRSU award, when a stock trust is utilized, the\nFirm contributes shares to be held in the\nstock trust until the RSUs convert to common\nshares. The assets of the employee stock\ntrusts are consolidated with those of the Firm\nand are generally accounted for in a manner\nsimilar to treasury stock, where the shares of\ncommon stock outstanding reported in Common\nstock issued to employee stock trusts are\noffset by an equal amount reported in Employee\nstock trusts in the balance sheet. The Firm\nuses the grant-date fair value of stock-based\ncompensation as the basis for recording the\nmovement of the assets to or from the employee\nstock trusts. Changes in the fair value are\nnot recognized as the Firm\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation must be settled by delivery of a\nfixed number of shares of the Firm\u2019s common\nstock. Deferred Cash-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for DCP awards is\ncalculated based on the notional value of the\naward granted, adjusted for changes in the\nfair value of the referenced investments that\nemployees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of deferred\nawards. The Firm invests directly, as a\nprincipal, in financial instruments and other\ninvestments to economically hedge certain of\nits obligations under its DCP. Changes in the\nvalue of such investments are recorded in\nTrading revenues and Investments revenues.\nAlthough changes in compensation expense\nresulting from changes in the fair value of\nthe referenced investments will generally be\noffset by changes in the fair value of\ninvestments made by the Firm, there is\ntypically a timing difference between the\nimmediate recognition of gains and losses on\nthe Firm\u2019s investments and\n                                 \n  95    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthe deferred recognition of the related\ncompensation expense over the vesting period.\nRetirement-Eligible Employee Compensation For\nyear-end stock-based awards and DCP awards\nanticipated to be granted to retirement-\neligible employees under award terms that do\nnot contain a future service requirement, the\nFirm accrues the estimated cost of the awards\nover the course of the calendar year preceding\nthe grant date, which reflects the period over\nwhich the compensation is earned. Carried\nInterest Compensation The Firm generally\nrecognizes compensation expense for any\nportion of carried interest (both realized and\nunrealized) that is allocated to employees.\nFor information on performance-based fees in\nthe form of carried interest, which are\ndirectly related to carried interest\ncompensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014Carried\nInterest\u201d herein. Income Taxes Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based upon\nthe temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and income tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using currently enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The\neffect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in\nincome tax expense (benefit) in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. Such effects\nare recorded in Provision for income taxes\nregardless of where deferred taxes were\noriginally recorded. The Firm recognizes net\ndeferred tax assets to the extent that it\nbelieves these assets are more likely than not\nto be realized. In making such a\ndetermination, the Firm considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence,\nincluding future reversals of existing taxable\ntemporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and\nresults of recent operations. When performing\nthe assessment, the Firm considers all types\nof deferred tax assets in combination with\neach other, regardless of the origin of the\nunderlying temporary difference. If a deferred\ntax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. If the\nFirm subsequently determines that it would be\nable to realize deferred tax assets in excess\nof their net recorded amount, it would make an\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes. The Firm recognizes tax\nexpense associated with Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income as it is incurred as part of the\ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period. Uncertain tax\npositions are recorded on the basis of a two-\nstep process, whereby (i) the Firm determines\nwhether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis\nof the technical merits of the position and\n(ii) for those tax positions that meet this\nthreshold, the Firm recognizes the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon ultimate settlement\nwith the related tax authority. Interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\nare recognized as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes. Foreign Currencies Assets\nand liabilities of operations with non-U.S.\ndollar functional currencies are translated at\nyear-end rates of exchange. Gains or losses\nresulting from translating foreign currency\nfinancial statements, net of hedge gains or\nlosses and related tax effects, are reflected\nin AOCI in the balance sheet. Gains or losses\nresulting from remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in net\nincome, and amounts recognized in the income\nstatement are translated at the rate of\nexchange on the respective date of recognition\nfor each amount. Accounting Updates Adopted in\n2023 Fair Value Measurement - Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions The Firm early adopted the Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject\nto Contractual Sale Restrictions accounting\nupdate on July 1, 2023, with no material\nimpact on the Firm\u2019s financial condition or\nresults of operations upon adoption. The\nupdate clarifies that a contractual sale\nrestriction is not considered part of the unit\nof account of an equity security and,\ntherefore, is not considered in measuring fair\nvalue. Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\nThe Firm adopted the Financial Instruments-\nCredit Losses accounting update on January 1,\n2023, with no impact on the Firm\u2019s financial\ncondition or results of operations upon\nadoption. This accounting update eliminates\nthe accounting guidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and requires new\ndisclosures regarding certain modifications of\nfinancing receivables (i.e., principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-\nthan-insignificant payment delays and term\nextensions) to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The update also requires\ndisclosure of current period gross charge-offs\nby year of origination for financing\nreceivables measured at amortized cost. Refer\nto Note 9, Loans, Lending Commitments and\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses, for the\nnew disclosures. Accounting Update Adopted in\n2022 Reference Rate Reform The Firm has\nadopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting\nupdate, which extends the period of time\nentities can utilize the reference rate reform\nrelief guidance from December 31, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2024.

When\nevaluating the comparable instruments for use\nin the valuation of each security, security\ncollateral-specific attributes, including\npayment priority, credit enhancement levels,\ntype of collateral, delinquency rates and loss\nseverity, are considered. In addition, for\nRMBS borrowers, FICO scores and the level of\ndocumentation for the loan are considered. \u2022\nMarket standard cash flow models may be\nutilized to model the specific collateral\ncomposition and cash flow structure of each\ntransaction. Key inputs to these models are\nmarket spreads, forecasted credit losses, and\ndefault and prepayment rates for each asset\ncategory. \u2022 Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS\nindices are used as an additional data point\nfor benchmarking purposes or to price outright\nindex positions.

The valuation of loans and\nlending commitments also takes into account\nfee income that is considered an attribute of\nthe contract. \u2022 Fair value of mortgage loans\nis determined using observable prices based on\ntransactional data or third-party pricing for\ncomparable instruments, when available. \u2022\nWhere position-specific external prices are\nnot observable, fair value is estimated based\non benchmarking to prices and rates observed\nin the primary market for similar loan or\nborrower types or based on the present value\nof expected future cash flows using the Firm\u2019s\nbest available estimates of the key\nassumptions, including forecasted credit\nlosses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves\nand discount rates commensurate with the risks\ninvolved or a methodology that utilizes the\ncapital structure and credit spreads of recent\ncomparable securitization transactions. \u2022 Fair\nvalue of equity margin loans is determined by\ndiscounting future interest cash flows, net of\npotential losses resulting from large downward\nprice movements of the underlying margin loan\ncollateral. The potential losses are modeled\nusing the margin loan rate, which is\ncalibrated from market observable CDS spreads,\nimplied debt yields or volatility metrics of\nthe loan collateral.

In the case of more established\nderivative products, the pricing models used\nby the Firm are widely accepted by the\nfinancial services industry. \u2022 More complex\nOTC derivative products are typically less\nliquid and require more judgment in the\nimplementation of the valuation technique\nsince direct trading activity or quotes are\nunobservable. This includes certain types of\ninterest rate derivatives with both volatility\nand correlation exposure, equity, commodity or\nforeign currency derivatives that are either\nlonger-dated or include exposure to multiple\nunderlyings, and credit derivatives, including\nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities and basket CDS. Where required\ninputs are unobservable, relationships to\nobservable data points, based on historical\nand/or implied observations, may be employed\nas a technique to estimate the model input\nvalues.

A single amount is\ndisclosed for range\nand average when there\nis no significant\ndifference between the\nminimum, maximum and\naverage. Amounts\nrepresent weighted\naverages except where\nsimple averages and\nthe median of the\ninputs are more\nrelevant.\n\n2.

The\nlevel of aggregation\nand breadth of\nproducts cause the\nrange of inputs to be\nwide and not evenly\ndistributed across the\ninventory of financial\ninstruments. Further,\nthe range of\nunobservable inputs\nmay differ across\nfirms in the financial\nservices industry\nbecause of diversity\nin the types of\nproducts included in\neach firm\u2019s inventory.\nGenerally, there are\nno predictable\nrelationships between\nmultiple significant\nunobservable inputs\nattributable to a\ngiven valuation\ntechnique.\n                                  \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    104  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nDuring 2023, there were no significant\nrevisions made to the descriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s significant unobservable inputs. An\nincrease (decrease) to the following\nsignificant unobservable inputs would\ngenerally result in a higher (lower) fair\nvalue. \u2022 Comparable Bond or Loan Price. A\npricing input used when prices for the\nidentical instrument are not available.\nSignificant subjectivity may be involved when\nfair value is determined using pricing data\navailable for comparable instruments.\nValuation using comparable instruments can be\ndone by calculating an implied yield (or\nspread over a liquid benchmark) from the price\nof a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting\nthat yield (or spread) to derive a value for\nthe bond or loan. The adjustment to yield (or\nspread) should account for relevant\ndifferences in the bonds or loans, such as\nmaturity or credit quality. Alternatively, a\nprice-to-price basis can be assumed between\nthe comparable instrument and the bond or loan\nbeing valued in order to establish the value\nof the bond or loan. \u2022 Comparable Equity\nPrice. A price derived from equity raises,\nshare buybacks and external bid levels, etc. A\ndiscount or premium may be included in the\nfair value estimate. \u2022 Contingency\nProbability. Probability associated with the\nrealization of an underlying event upon which\nthe value of an asset is contingent. \u2022 EBITDA\nMultiple/Exit Multiple. The ratio of\nenterprise value to EBITDA, where enterprise\nvalue is the aggregate value of equity and\ndebt minus cash and cash equivalents. The\nEBITDA multiple reflects the value of a\ncompany in terms of its full-year EBITDA,\nwhereas the exit multiple reflects the value\nof a company in terms of its full-year\nexpected EBITDA at exit. Either multiple\nallows comparison between companies from an\noperational perspective as the effect of\ncapital structure, taxation and\ndepreciation/amortization is excluded. An\nincrease (decrease) to the following\nsignificant unobservable inputs would\ngenerally result in a lower (higher) fair\nvalue. \u2022 Cash-Synthetic Basis. The measure of\nthe price differential between cash financial\ninstruments and their synthetic derivative-\nbased equivalents. The range disclosed in the\nprevious table signifies the number of points\nby which the synthetic bond equivalent price\nis higher than the quoted price of the\nunderlying cash bonds. \u2022 Funding Spread. The\ncost of borrowing defined as the incremental\nspread over the OIS rate for a specific\ncollateral rate (which refers to the rate\napplicable to a specific type of security\npledged as collateral). \u2022 Loss Given Default.\nAmount expressed as a percentage of par that\nis the expected loss when a credit event\noccurs. \u2022 Margin Loan Rate. The annualized\nrate that reflects the possibility of losses\nas a result of movements in the price of the\nunderlying margin loan collateral. The rate is\ncalibrated from the discount rate, credit\nspreads and/or volatility measures. \u2022 WACC.\nWACC represents the theoretical rate of return\nrequired to debt and equity investors. The\nWACC is used in a discounted cash flow model\nthat calculates the value of the equity. The\nmodel assumes that the cash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections, are fully reflected in\nthe current equity value, while the debt to\nequity ratio is held constant. An increase\n(decrease) to the following significant\nunobservable inputs would generally result in\nan impact to the fair value, but the magnitude\nand direction of the impact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is long or short the\nexposure. \u2022 Correlation. A pricing input where\nthe payoff is driven by more than one\nunderlying risk. Correlation is a measure of\nthe relationship between the movement of two\nvariables (i.e., how the change in one\nvariable influences a change in the other\nvariable). \u2022 Credit Spread. The credit spread\nreflects the additional net yield an investor\ncan earn from a security with more credit risk\nrelative to one with less credit risk. The\ncredit spread of a particular security is\noften quoted in relation to the yield on a\ncredit risk-free benchmark security or\nreference rate. \u2022 Interest Rate Curve. The\nterm structure of interest rates (relationship\nbetween interest rates and the time to\nmaturity) and a market\u2019s measure of future\ninterest rates at the time of observation. An\ninterest rate curve is used to set interest\nrate and foreign exchange derivative cash\nflows and is a pricing input used in the\ndiscounting of any OTC derivative cash flow. \u2022\nVolatility. The measure of variability in\npossible returns for an instrument given how\nmuch that instrument changes in value over\ntime. Volatility is a pricing input for\noptions, and, generally, the lower the\nvolatility, the less risky the option. The\nlevel of volatility used in the valuation of a\nparticular option depends on a number of\nfactors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying that option, the tenor and the\nstrike price of the option. \u2022 Volatility Skew.\nThe measure of the difference in implied\nvolatility for options with identical\nunderliers and expiry dates but with different\nstrikes.\n                                  \n  105    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNet Asset Value\nMeasurements\nFund Interests\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        Ca\u2026                 Ca\u2026            \n  in       Va\u2026       Co\u2026       Va\u2026       Co\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  720    $  2,\u2026    $  638  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  R\u2026       2,\u2026       240       2,\u2026       239  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  H\u2026        74         3       190         3  \n  T\u2026    $  5,\u2026    $  963    $  5,\u2026    $  880  \n                                              \nAmounts in the\nprevious table\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s\ncarrying value of\ngeneral and limited\npartnership interests\nin fund investments,\nas well as any related\nperformance-based\nincome in the form of\ncarried interest.

A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties for\nthese derivatives are\nbanks, broker-dealers,\nand insurance and\nother financial\ninstitutions. The fair\nvalue amounts as shown\nin the previous tables\nare prior to cash\ncollateral or\ncounterparty netting.\nThe purchase of credit\nprotection does not\nrepresent the sole\nmanner in which the\nFirm risk manages its\nexposure to credit\nderivatives. The Firm\nmanages its exposure\nto these derivative\ncontracts through a\nvariety of risk\nmitigation strategies,\nwhich include managing\nthe credit and\ncorrelation risk\nacross single-name,\nnon-tranched indices\nand baskets, tranched\nindices and baskets,\nand cash positions.\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\nestablished for credit\nderivatives, and\nmarket risk measures\nare routinely\nmonitored against\nthese limits. The Firm\nmay also recover\namounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligation delivered\nto the Firm under CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS\nprotects the buyer\nagainst the loss of\nprincipal on a bond or\nloan in case of a\ndefault by the issuer.\nThe protection buyer\npays a periodic\npremium (generally\nquarterly) over the\nlife of the contract\nand is protected for\nthe period. The Firm,\nin turn, performs\nunder a CDS if a\ncredit event as\ndefined under the\ncontract occurs.\nTypical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay and\nrestructuring of the\nobligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.\nIndex and basket CDS\nare products where\ncredit protection is\nprovided on a\nportfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally,\nin the event of a\ndefault on one of the\nunderlying names, the\nFirm pays a pro rata\nportion of the total\nnotional amount of the\nCDS. The Firm also\nenters into tranched\nindex and basket CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection is provided\non a particular\nportion of the\nportfolio loss\ndistribution. The most\njunior tranches cover\ninitial defaults, and\nonce losses exceed the\nnotional of the\n                                  \n  111    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ntranche, they are\npassed on to the next\nmost senior tranche in\nthe capital structure.\nOther Credit\nContracts.

For Corporate,\nSecured lending\nfacilities and Other\nloans, credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the evaluation\nof financial\nstatements, assessment\nof leverage,\nliquidity, capital\nstrength, asset\ncomposition and\nquality, market\ncapitalization and\naccess to capital\nmarkets, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements,\nand the adequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable. The CRM\nalso evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, obligor\u2019s\nmanagement and other\nfactors that could\naffect an obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile. For\nCommercial real estate\nloans, the credit\nevaluation is focused\non property and\ntransaction metrics,\nincluding property\ntype, LTV ratio,\noccupancy levels, debt\nservice ratio,\nprevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\nFor Residential real\nestate and Securities-\nbased loans, the\ninitial credit\nevaluation typically\nincludes, but is not\nlimited to, review of\nthe obligor\u2019s income,\nnet worth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand credit bureau\ninformation.\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nresidential real\nestate loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level.\nSecurities-based loan\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis.

The\nFirm uses interest\nrate swaps to more\nclosely match these\nborrowings to the\nduration, holding\nperiod and interest\nrate characteristics\nof the assets being\nfunded and to manage\ninterest rate risk.\nThese swaps\neffectively convert\ncertain of the Firm\u2019s\nfixed rate borrowings\ninto floating rate\nobligations. In\naddition, for non-U.S.\ndollar currency\nborrowings that are\nnot used to fund\nassets in the same\ncurrency, the Firm has\nentered into currency\nswaps that effectively\nconvert the borrowings\ninto U.S. dollar\nobligations.

Forward-starting\nsecured financing\nreceivables are\ngenerally settled\nwithin three business\ndays.\nSince commitments\nassociated with these\ninstruments may expire\nunused, the amounts\nshown do not\nnecessarily reflect\nthe actual future cash\nfunding requirements.\n\nTypes of Commitments\n\nLending Commitments.\nLending commitments\nprimarily represent\nthe notional amount of\nlegally binding\nobligations to provide\nfunding to clients for\ndifferent types of\nloan transactions. For\nsyndications that are\nled by the Firm, the\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed are net of the\namounts agreed to by\ncounterparties that\nwill participate in\nthe syndication. For\nsyndications that the\nFirm participates in\nand does not lead,\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed include only\nthe amount that the\nFirm expects it will\nbe allocated from the\nlead syndicate bank.\nDue to the nature of\nthe Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder the commitments,\nthese amounts include\ncertain commitments\nparticipated to third\nparties.\n\nForward-Starting\nSecured Financing\nReceivables. This\namount includes\nsecurities purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed that the Firm\nhas entered into prior\nto the balance sheet\ndate that will settle\nafter the balance\nsheet date. These\ntransactions are\nprimarily secured by\ncollateral from U.S.\ngovernment agency\nsecurities and other\nsovereign government\nobligations when they\nare funded.\n\nCentral Counterparty.\nThese commitments\nrelate to the Firm\u2019s\nmembership in certain\nclearinghouses and are\ncontingent upon the\ndefault of a\nclearinghouse member\nor other stress\nevents.\nUnderwriting\nCommitments. The Firm\nprovides underwriting\ncommitments in\nconnection with its\ncapital raising\nsources to a diverse\ngroup of corporate and\nother institutional\nclients. Investment\nActivities. The Firm\nsponsors several non-\nconsolidated\ninvestment management\nfunds for third-party\ninvestors where it\ntypically acts as\ngeneral partner of,\nand investment adviser\nto, these funds and\ntypically commits to\ninvest a minority of\nthe capital of such\nfunds, with\nsubscribing third-\nparty investors\ncontributing the\nmajority. The Firm has\ncontractual capital\ncommitments,\nguarantees and\ncounterparty\narrangements with\nrespect to these\ninvestment management\nfunds. Letters of\nCredit and Other\nFinancial Guarantees.\nThe Firm has\noutstanding letters of\ncredit and other\nfinancial guarantees\nissued by third-party\nbanks to certain of\nthe Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties. The\nFirm is contingently\nliable for these\nletters of credit and\nother financial\nguarantees, which are\nprimarily used to\nprovide collateral for\nsecurities and\ncommodities traded and\nto satisfy various\nmargin requirements in\nlieu of depositing\ncash or securities\nwith these\ncounterparties.\nGuarantees\n                                              \n           At                                 \n         Dec\u2026                                 \n          31,                                 \n         2023                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         Max\u2026                                 \n         Pot\u2026                                 \n         Pay\u2026                           Car\u2026  \n           of                           Amo\u2026  \n         Obl\u2026                           Ass\u2026  \n           by                           (Li\u2026  \n         Yea\u2026                                 \n           to                                 \n         Mat\u2026                                 \n  $      Less                    Ov\u2026          \n  in     than     1-3     3-5      5          \n  mi\u2026       1                                 \n  No\u2026    1,5\u2026    1,3\u2026    268\u2026    77\u2026    -44\u2026  \n  de\u2026                                         \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  and    1,4\u2026     977    1,3\u2026    2,\u2026      -2  \n  ot\u2026                                         \n  fi\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  is\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  va\u2026       1       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Li\u2026    2,0\u2026       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014      -1  \n  fa\u2026                                         \n  Wh\u2026                                         \n  lo\u2026       \u2014      77      10    23\u2026       \u2014  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014    80\u2026      -3  \n  and                                         \n  wa\u2026                                         \n  Ge\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026     398      32     139     24     -89  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Cl\u2026                                         \n  cl\u2026     228       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n                                              \n1. The carrying amounts of derivative\ncontracts that meet the accounting definition\nof a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For\nfurther information on derivative contracts,\nsee Note 6.\n2. These amounts include certain issued\nstandby letters of credit participated to\nthird parties, totaling $ 0.9billion of\nnotional and collateral/recourse, due to the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s obligations under these\narrangements. As of December 31, 2023, the\ncarrying amount of standby letters of credit\nand other financial guarantees issued includes\nan allowance for credit losses of $ 70million.\n3. Related to commercial and residential\nmortgage securitizations.\nTypes of Guarantees\nNon-Credit\nDerivatives. Certain\nderivative contracts\nmeet the accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, including\ncertain written\noptions, contingent-\nforward contracts and\nCDS (see Note 6\nregarding credit\nderivatives in which\nthe Firm has sold\ncredit protection to\nthe counterparty which\nare excluded from the\nprevious table). For\nnon-credit derivative\ncontracts that meet\nthe accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee the notional\namount is used as the\nmaximum potential\npayout for certain\nderivative contracts,\nsuch as written\ninterest rate caps and\nwritten foreign\ncurrency options. The\nFirm evaluates\ncollateral\nrequirements for all\nderivatives, including\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\n                                  \n  123    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \naccounting definition of a guarantee. For the\neffects of cash collateral and counterparty\nnetting, see Note 6. In certain situations,\ncollateral may be held by the Firm for those\ncontracts that meet the definition of a\nguarantee. Generally, the Firm sets collateral\nrequirements by counterparty so that the\ncollateral covers various transactions and\nproducts and is not allocated specifically to\nindividual contracts. Also, the Firm may\nrecover amounts related to the underlying\nasset delivered to the Firm under the\nderivative contract. Standby Letters of Credit\nand Other Financial Guarantees Issued.\nGenerally, in connection with its lending\nbusinesses, the Firm provides standby letters\nof credit and other financial guarantees to\ncounterparties. Such arrangements represent\nobligations to make payments to third parties\nif the counterparty fails to fulfill its\nobligation under a borrowing arrangement or\nother contractual obligation. A majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s standby letters of credit are\nprovided on behalf of counterparties that are\ninvestment grade. If the counterparty fails to\nfulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm\nhas access to collateral or recourse that\nwould approximate its obligation. Market Value\nGuarantees. Market value guarantees are issued\nto guarantee timely payment of a specified\nreturn to investors in certain affordable\nhousing tax credit funds. These guarantees are\ndesigned to return an investor\u2019s contribution\nto a fund and the investor\u2019s share of tax\nlosses and tax credits expected to be\ngenerated by a fund. Liquidity Facilities. The\nFirm has entered into liquidity facilities\nwith SPEs and other counterparties, whereby\nthe Firm is required to make certain payments\nif losses or defaults occur. Primarily, the\nFirm acts as liquidity provider to municipal\nbond securitization SPEs and for stand-alone\nmunicipal bonds in which the holders of\nbeneficial interests issued by these SPEs or\nthe holders of the individual bonds,\nrespectively, have the right to tender their\ninterests for purchase by the Firm on\nspecified dates at a specified price. The Firm\noften may have recourse to the underlying\nassets held by the SPEs in the event payments\nare required under such liquidity facilities,\nas well as make-whole or recourse provisions\nwith the trust sponsors. The recourse amount\noften exceeds the maximum potential payout\namount of the guarantee. Substantially all of\nthe underlying assets in the SPEs are\ninvestment grade. Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond\ntrusts are classified as derivatives. Whole\nLoan Sales Guarantees. The Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain whole loan sales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may be required to\nrepurchase such assets or make other payments\nrelated to such assets if such representations\nand warranties are breached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential payout related to such\nrepresentations and warranties is equal to the\ncurrent UPB of such loans. Since the Firm no\nlonger services these loans, it has no\ninformation on the current UPB of those loans,\nand, accordingly, the amount included in the\nprevious table represents the UPB at the time\nof the whole loan sale or at the time when the\nFirm last serviced any of those loans. The\ncurrent UPB balances could be substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout amount\nincluded in the previous table. The related\nliability primarily relates to sales of loans\nto the federal mortgage agencies.\nSecuritization Representations and Warranties.\nAs part of the Firm\u2019s Institutional Securities\nbusiness segment\u2019s securitizations and related\nactivities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain assets transferred in securitization\ntransactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent\nand nature of the representations and\nwarranties, if any, vary among different\nsecuritizations. Under certain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be required to repurchase certain\nassets or make other payments related to such\nassets if such representations and warranties\nare breached. The maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments the Firm could be required to\nmake would be equal to the current outstanding\nbalances of, or losses associated with, the\nassets subject to breaches of such\nrepresentations and warranties. The amount\nincluded in the previous table for the maximum\npotential payout includes the current UPB or\nhistorical losses where known and the UPB at\nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not\nknown. General Partner Guarantees. As a\ngeneral partner in certain investment\nmanagement funds, the Firm receives certain\ndistributions from the partnerships when the\nreturn exceeds specified performance targets\naccording to the provisions of the partnership\nagreements. The Firm may be required to return\nall or a portion of such distributions to the\nlimited partners in the event the limited\npartners do not achieve a certain return as\nspecified in the various partnership\nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees. The Firm is a\nsponsoring member of the Government Securities\nDivision of the FICC's Sponsored Clearing\nModel. Clients of the Firm, as sponsored\nmembers, can transact in overnight and term\nsecurities repurchase and resale agreements,\nwhich are cleared through the FICC. As\nsponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the\nFICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its clients\u2019 obligations. In\n2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing model was\nupdated such that the Firm could be\nresponsible for liquidation of a sponsored\nmember\u2019s account and guarantees any resulting\nloss to the FICC in the event the sponsored\nmember fails to fully pay any net liquidation\namount due from the sponsored member to the\nFICC. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum\npotential payout amount reflects the total of\nthe estimated net liquidation amounts for\nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes\ncredit exposure under this guarantee by\nobtaining a security interest in its sponsored\nmember clients\u2019 collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member\ntransactions. Therefore, the Firm's exposure\nis estimated to be an amount substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout\n                                  \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    124  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \namount. The collateral amount in which the\nFirm has a security interest is approximately\nequal to the maximum potential payout amount\nof the guarantee. Other Guarantees and\nIndemnities In the normal course of business,\nthe Firm provides guarantees and\nindemnifications in a variety of transactions.\nThese provisions generally are standard\ncontractual terms. Certain of these guarantees\nand indemnifications are described below: \u2022\nIndemnities . The Firm provides standard\nindemnities to counterparties for certain\ncontingent exposures and taxes, including U.S.\nand foreign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities\nand stock lending transactions, certain\nannuity products and other financial\narrangements. These indemnity payments could\nbe required based on a change in the tax laws,\na change in interpretation of applicable tax\nrulings or a change in factual circumstances.\nCertain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The Firm\nmay also provide indemnities when it sells a\nbusiness or assets to a third-party, pursuant\nto which it indemnifies the third-party for\nlosses incurred on assets acquired or\nliabilities assumed or due to actions taken by\nthe Firm prior to the sale of the business or\nassets. The Firm expects the risk of loss\nassociated with indemnities related to the\nsale of businesses or assets to be remote. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Firm could be required to make under\nthese indemnifications cannot be estimated. \u2022\nExchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The\nFirm is a member of various exchanges and\nclearinghouses that trade and clear securities\nand/or derivative contracts. Associated with\nits membership, the Firm may be required to\npay a certain amount as determined by the\nexchange or the clearinghouse in case of a\ndefault of any of its members or pay a\nproportionate share of the financial\nobligations of another member that may default\non its obligations to the exchange or the\nclearinghouse. While the rules governing\ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse\nmemberships and the forms of these guarantees\nmay vary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder these rules would arise only if the\nexchange or clearinghouse had previously\nexhausted its resources. In addition, some\nclearinghouse rules require members to assume\na proportionate share of losses resulting from\nthe clearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee\nfund contributions and initial margin and of\nother losses unrelated to the default of a\nclearing member, if such losses exceed the\nspecified resources allocated for such purpose\nby the clearinghouse. The maximum potential\npayout under these rules cannot be estimated.\nThe Firm has not recorded any contingent\nliability in its financial statements for\nthese agreements and believes that any\npotential requirement to make payments under\nthese agreements is remote. \u2022 Merger and\nAcquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from\ntime to time, in its role as investment\nbanking advisor be required to provide\nguarantees in connection with certain European\nmerger and acquisition transactions. If\nrequired by the regulating authorities, the\nFirm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in\nthe transaction has or will have sufficient\nfunds to complete the transaction and would\nthen be required to make the acquisition\npayments in the event the acquirer\u2019s funds are\ninsufficient at the completion date of the\ntransaction. These arrangements generally\ncover the time frame from the transaction\noffer date to its closing date and, therefore,\nare generally short term in nature. The Firm\nbelieves the likelihood of any payment by the\nFirm under these arrangements is remote given\nthe level of its due diligence in its role as\ninvestment banking advisor. In addition, in\nthe ordinary course of business, the Firm\nguarantees the debt and/or certain trading\nobligations (including obligations associated\nwith derivatives, foreign exchange contracts\nand the settlement of physical commodities) of\ncertain subsidiaries. These guarantees\ngenerally are entity or product specific and\nare required by investors or trading\ncounterparties. The activities of the Firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries covered by these guarantees\n(including any related debt or trading\nobligations) are included in the financial\nstatements. Finance Subsidiary The Parent\nCompany fully and unconditionally guarantees\nthe securities issued by Morgan Stanley\nFinance LLC, a wholly owned finance\nsubsidiary. No other subsidiary of the Parent\nCompany guarantees these securities.\nContingencies Legal In addition to the matters\ndescribed below, in the normal course of\nbusiness, the Firm has been named, from time\nto time, as a defendant in various legal\nactions, including arbitrations, class actions\nand other litigation, arising in connection\nwith its activities as a global diversified\nfinancial services institution. Certain of the\nactual or threatened legal actions include\nclaims for substantial compensatory and/or\npunitive damages or claims for indeterminate\namounts of damages. In some cases, the third-\nparty entities that are, or would otherwise\nbe, the primary defendants in such cases are\nbankrupt, in financial distress, or may not\nhonor applicable indemnification obligations.\nThese actions have included, but are not\nlimited to, antitrust claims, claims under\nvarious false claims act statutes, and matters\narising from our sales and trading businesses\nand our activities in the capital markets. The\nFirm is also involved, from time to time, in\nother reviews, investigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal) by\n                                  \n  125    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ngovernmental and self-\nregulatory agencies\nregarding the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\ntrading, financing,\nprime brokerage,\nmarket-making\nactivities, investment\nbanking advisory\nservices, capital\nmarkets activities,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, wealth\nand investment\nmanagement services,\nand accounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ndisgorgement,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief. The Firm\ncontests liability\nand/or the amount of\ndamages as appropriate\nin each pending\nmatter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss or the range of\nloss, the Firm accrues\nan estimated loss by a\ncharge to income,\nincluding with respect\nto certain of the\nindividual proceedings\nor investigations\ndescribed below.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions        2023       2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Legal        $   488    $   443    $   157  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s legal expenses can, and may in the\nfuture, fluctuate from period to period, given\nthe current environment regarding government\nor self-regulatory agency investigations and\nprivate litigation affecting global financial\nservices firms, including the Firm. In many\nlegal proceedings and investigations, it is\ninherently difficult to determine whether any\nloss is probable or reasonably possible, or to\nestimate the amount of any loss. In addition,\neven where the Firm has determined that a loss\nis probable or reasonably possible or an\nexposure to loss or range of loss exists in\nexcess of the liability already accrued with\nrespect to a previously recognized loss\ncontingency, the Firm is often unable to\nreasonably estimate the amount of the loss or\nrange of loss. It is particularly difficult to\ndetermine if a loss is probable or reasonably\npossible, or to estimate the amount of loss,\nwhere the factual record is being developed or\ncontested or where plaintiffs or government\nentities seek substantial or indeterminate\ndamages, restitution, forfeiture, disgorgement\nor penalties. Numerous issues may need to be\nresolved in an investigation or proceeding\nbefore a determination can be made that a loss\nor additional loss (or range of loss or range\nof additional loss) is probable or reasonably\npossible, or to estimate the amount of loss,\nincluding through potentially lengthy\ndiscovery or determination of important\nfactual matters, determination of issues\nrelated to class certification, the\ncalculation of damages or other relief, and\nconsideration of novel or unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to the proceedings or\ninvestigations in question. The Firm has\nidentified below any individual proceedings or\ninvestigations where the Firm believes a\nmaterial loss (or where an accrual has\noccurred, a material loss beyond the\n\namount already accrued) to be reasonably\npossible. In many legal proceedings in which\nthe Firm has determined that a material loss\n(or where an accrual has occurred, a material\nloss beyond the amount already accrued) is\nreasonably possible, the Firm is unable to\nreasonably estimate the loss or range of loss.\nThere are other matters in which the Firm has\ndetermined a loss or range of loss to be\nreasonably possible, but the Firm does not\nbelieve, based on current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel, that such losses\ncould have a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s financial statements as a whole,\nalthough the outcome of such proceedings or\ninvestigations may significantly impact the\nFirm\u2019s business or results of operations for\nany particular reporting period, or cause\nsignificant reputational harm. While the Firm\nhas identified below certain proceedings or\ninvestigations that the Firm believes to be\nmaterial, individually or collectively, there\ncan be no assurance that material losses will\nnot be incurred from claims that have not yet\nbeen asserted or those where potential losses\nhave not yet been determined to be probable or\nreasonably possible. Block Trading Matter On\nJanuary 12, 2024, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\nfor the Southern District of New York (\u201cUSAO\u201d)\nand the SEC announced they had reached\nsettlement agreements with the Firm in\nconnection with their investigations into the\nFirm\u2019s blocks business. Specifically, the Firm\nentered into a three-yearnon-prosecution\nagreement (\u201cNPA\u201d) with the USAO that included\nthe payment of forfeiture, restitution, and a\ncriminal fine for making false statements in\nconnection with the sale of certain block\ntrades from 2018 through August 2021. The NPA\nrequired the Firm to admit responsibility for\ncertain acts of its employees and to continue\nto cooperate with and provide certain\ninformation to the USAO for the term of the\nagreement. Additionally, the SEC charged the\nFirm with violations of Section 10(b) of the\nExchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder for\nthe disclosure of confidential information\nabout block trades and also violations of\nSection 15(g) of the Exchange Act for the\nfailure to enforce its policies concerning the\nmisuse of material non-public information\nrelated to block trades. As part of the SEC\nagreement, the Firm paid disgorgement and a\ncivil penalty. After the agreed-upon credits\nwere applied, the Firm paid a total amount of\napproximately $ 249million under both\nsettlements. The Firm also faces potential\ncivil liability arising from claims that have\nbeen or may be asserted by, among others,\nblock transaction participants who contend\nthey were harmed or disadvantaged including,\namong other things, as a result of a share\nprice decline allegedly caused by the\nactivities of the Firm and/or its employees,\nor as a result of the Firm\u2019s and/or its\nemployees\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable\nlaws and regulations. In addition, the Firm\nhas responded to demands from shareholders\nunder Section 220 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law for books and records\nconcerning the investigations.\n                                  \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    126  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAntitrust Related Matters The Firm and other\nfinancial institutions are responding to a\nnumber of governmental investigations and\ncivil litigation matters related to\nallegations of anticompetitive conduct in\nvarious aspects of the financial services\nindustry, including the matters described\nbelow. Beginning in February of 2016, the Firm\nwas named as a defendant in multiple purported\nantitrust class actions now consolidated into\na single proceeding in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nNew York (\u201cSDNY\u201d) styled In Re: Interest Rate\nSwaps Antitrust Litigation . Plaintiffs\nallege, inter alia, that the Firm, together\nwith a number of other financial institution\ndefendants, violated U.S. and New York state\nantitrust laws from 2008 through December of\n2016 in connection with their alleged efforts\nto prevent the development of electronic\nexchange-based platforms for interest rate\nswaps trading. Complaints were filed both on\nbehalf of a purported class of investors who\npurchased interest rate swaps from defendants,\nas well as on behalf of three operators of\nswap execution facilities that allegedly were\nthwarted by the defendants in their efforts to\ndevelop such platforms. The consolidated\ncomplaints seek, among other relief,\ncertification of the investor class of\nplaintiffs and treble damages. On July 28,\n2017, the court granted in part and denied in\npart the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\ncomplaints. On December 15, 2023, the court\ndenied the class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification. On December 29, 2023, the class\nplaintiffs petitioned the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit for leave to\nappeal that decision. In August of 2017, the\nFirm was named as a defendant in a purported\nantitrust class action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the SDNY styled Iowa Public\nEmployees\u2019 Retirement System et al. v. Bank of\nAmerica Corporation et al. Plaintiffs allege,\ninter alia, that the Firm, together with a\nnumber of other financial institution\ndefendants, violated U.S. antitrust laws and\nNew York state law in connection with their\nalleged efforts to prevent the development of\nelectronic exchange-based platforms for\nsecurities lending. The class action complaint\nwas filed on behalf of a purported class of\nborrowers and lenders who entered into stock\nloan transactions with the defendants. The\nclass action complaint seeks, among other\nrelief, certification of the class of\nplaintiffs and treble damages. On September\n27, 2018, the court denied the defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss the class action complaint.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification was\nreferred by the District Court to a magistrate\njudge who, on June 30, 2022, issued a report\nand recommendation that the District Court\ncertify a class. On May 20, 2023, the Firm\nreached an agreement in principle to settle\nthe litigation. On September 1, 2023, the\ncourt granted preliminary approval of the\nsettlement. The Firm is a defendant in three\nantitrust class action complaints which have\nbeen consolidated into one proceeding in the\nUnited States District Court for the SDNY\nunder the caption City of Philadelphia, et al.\nv. Bank of America Corporation, et al.\nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm,\nalong with a number of other financial\ninstitution defendants, violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and relevant state laws in\nconnection with alleged efforts to\nartificially inflate interest rates for\nVariable Rate Demand Obligations (\u201cVRDO\u201d).\nPlaintiffs seek, among other relief, treble\ndamages. The class action complaint was filed\non behalf of a class of municipal issuers of\nVRDO for which defendants served as\nremarketing agent. On November 2, 2020, the\ncourt granted in part and denied in part the\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated\ncomplaint, dismissing state law claims, but\ndenying dismissal of the U.S. antitrust\nclaims. On September 21, 2023, the court\ngranted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification. On October 5, 2023, defendants\npetitioned the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit for leave to appeal\nthat decision, which was granted on February\n5, 2024. Qui Tam Matters The Firm and other\nfinancial institutions are defending against\nqui tam litigations brought under various\nstate false claims statutes, including the\nmatter described below. Such matters may\ninvolve the same types of claims pursued in\nmultiple jurisdictions and may include claims\nfor treble damages. On August 18, 2009,\nRelators Roger Hayes and C. Talbot\nHeppenstall, Jr., filed a qui tam action in\nNew Jersey state court styled State of New\nJersey ex. rel. Hayes v. Bank of America\nCorp., et al. The complaint, filed under seal\npursuant to the New Jersey False Claims Act,\nalleged that the Firm and several other\nunderwriters of municipal bonds had defrauded\nNew Jersey issuers by misrepresenting that\nthey would achieve the best price or lowest\ncost of capital in connection with certain\nmunicipal bond issuances. On March 17, 2016,\nthe court entered an order unsealing the\ncomplaint. On November 17, 2017, Relators\nfiled an amended complaint to allege the Firm\nmispriced certain bonds issued in twenty-three\nbond offerings between 2008 and 2017, having a\ntotal par amount of $ 6.9billion. The\ncomplaint seeks, among other relief, treble\ndamages. On February 22, 2018, the Firm moved\nto dismiss the amended complaint, and on July\n17, 2018, the court denied the Firm\u2019s motion.\nOn October 13, 2021, following a series of\nvoluntary and involuntary dismissals, Relators\nlimited their claims to certain bonds issued\nin five offerings the Firm underwrote between\n2008 and 2011, having a total par amount of $\n3.9billion. On August 22, 2023, the Firm\nreached an agreement in principle to settle\nthe litigation. European Matters Tax In\nmatters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case\nnumber 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority\n(\u201cDutch Authority\u201d) is challenging in the\nDutch courts the prior set-off by the Firm\n                                  \n  127    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nof approximately \u20ac 124million (approximately $\n137million) plus accrued interest of\nwithholding tax credits against the Firm\u2019s\ncorporation tax liabilities for the tax years\n2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority alleges that\nthe Firm was not entitled to receive the\nwithholding tax credits on the basis, inter\nalia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold\nlegal title to certain securities subject to\nwithholding tax on the relevant dates. The\nDutch Authority has also alleged that the Firm\nfailed to provide certain information to the\nDutch Authority and to keep adequate books and\nrecords. On April 26, 2018, the District Court\nin Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the\nDutch Authority\u2019s claims with respect to\ncertain of the tax years in dispute. On May\n12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam\ngranted the Dutch Authority's appeal in\nmatters re-styled Case number 18/00318 and\nCase number 18/00319 . On January 19, 2024,\nthe Dutch High Court granted the Firm\u2019s appeal\nin matters re-styled Case number 20/01884 and\nreferred the case to the Court of Appeal in\nThe Hague. On June 22, 2021, Dutch criminal\nauthorities sought various documents in\nconnection with an investigation of the Firm\nrelated to the civil claims asserted by the\nDutch Authority concerning the accuracy of the\nFirm subsidiary\u2019s tax returns and the\nmaintenance of its books and records for 2007\nto 2012. The Dutch criminal authorities have\nrequested additional information, and the Firm\nis continuing to respond to them in connection\nwith their ongoing investigation. Danish\nUnderwriting Matter On October 5, 2017,\nvarious institutional investors filed a claim\nagainst the Firm and another bank in a matter\nnow styled Case number B-803-18 (previously BS\n99-6998/2017 ), in the City Court of\nCopenhagen, Denmark concerning their roles as\nunderwriters of the initial public offering\n(\u201cIPO\u201d) in March 2014 of the Danish company OW\nBunker A/S. The claim seeks damages of\napproximately DKK 529million (approximately $\n79million) plus interest in respect of alleged\nlosses arising from investing in shares in OW\nBunker, which entered into bankruptcy in\nNovember 2014. Separately, on November 29,\n2017, another group of institutional investors\njoined the Firm and another bank as defendants\nto pending proceedings in the High Court of\nEastern Denmark against various other parties\ninvolved in the IPO in a matter styled Case\nnumber B-2073-16 . The claim brought against\nthe Firm and the other bank has been given its\nown Case number B-2564-17 . The investors\nclaim damages of approximately DKK 767million\n(approximately $ 114million) plus interest\nfrom the Firm and the other bank on a joint\nand several basis with the Defendants to these\nproceedings. Both claims are based on alleged\nprospectus liability; the second claim also\nalleges professional liability of banks acting\nas financial intermediaries. On June 8, 2018,\nthe City Court of Copenhagen, Denmark ordered\nthat the matters now styled Case number\nB-803-18 , Case number B-2073-16 , and Case\nnumber B-2564-17 be heard together before the\nHigh Court of Eastern Denmark. On June 29,\n2018, the Firm filed its defense to the matter\nnow styled Case number B-2564-17 . On February\n4, 2019, the Firm filed its defense to the\nmatter now styled Case number B-803-18 . U.K.\nGovernment Bond Matter The Firm is engaging\nwith the UK Competition and Markets Authority\nin connection with its investigation of\nsuspected anti-competitive arrangements in the\nfinancial services sector, specifically\nregarding the Firm's activities concerning\ncertain liquid fixed income products between\n2009 and 2012. On May 24, 2023, the U.K.\nCompetition and Markets Authority issued a\nStatement of Objections setting out its\nprovisional findings that the Firm had\nbreached U.K. competition law by sharing\ncompetitively sensitive information in\nconnection with gilts and gilt asset swaps\nbetween 2009 and 2012. The Firm is contesting\nthe provisional findings. Separately, on June\n16, 2023, the Firm was named as a defendant in\na purported antitrust class action in the\nUnited States District Court for the SDNY\nstyled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and\nRetirement System v. Deutsche Bank\nAktiengesellschaft, et al. , alleging, inter\nalia, that the Firm, together with a number of\nother financial institution defendants,\nviolated U.S. antitrust laws in connection\nwith their alleged effort to fix prices of\ngilts traded in the United States between 2009\nand 2013. On September 28, 2023, the\ndefendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint, which has been fully briefed. Other\nOn August 13, 2021, the plaintiff in Camelot\nEvent Driven Fund, a Series of Frank Funds\nTrust v. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, et al.\nfiled in the Supreme Court of the State of New\nYork, New York County (\"Supreme Court of NY\")\na purported class action complaint alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws\nagainst ViacomCBS (\u201cViacom\u201d), certain of its\nofficers and directors, and the underwriters,\nincluding the Firm, of two March 2021 Viacom\nofferings: a $ 1.7billion Viacom Class B\nCommon Stock offering and a $ 1billion\noffering of 5.75% Series A Mandatory\nConvertible Preferred Stock (collectively, the\n\u201cOfferings\u201d). The complaint alleges, inter\nalia, that the Viacom offering documents for\nboth issuances contained material omissions\nbecause they did not disclose that certain of\nthe underwriters, including the Firm, had\nprime brokerage relationships and served as\ncounterparties to certain derivative\ntransactions with Archegos Capital Management\nLP, (\u201cArchegos\u201d), a fund with significant\nexposure to Viacom securities across multiple\nprime brokers.

Variable Interest\nEntities and\nSecuritization\nActivities\nOverview The Firm is involved with various\nSPEs in the normal course of business. In most\ncases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include\ndebt and equity interests, commitments,\nguarantees, derivative instruments and certain\nfees. The Firm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises\nprimarily from: \u2022 Interests purchased in\nconnection with market-making activities,\nsecurities held in its Investment securities\nportfolio and retained interests held as a\nresult of securitization activities, including\nre-securitization transactions.\n\n\u2022 Guarantees issued and residual interests\nretained in connection with municipal bond\nsecuritizations. \u2022 Loans made to and\ninvestments in VIEs that hold debt, equity,\nreal estate or other assets. \u2022 Derivatives\nentered into with VIEs. \u2022 Structuring of CLNs\nor other asset-repackaging notes designed to\nmeet the investment objectives of clients. \u2022\nOther structured transactions designed to\nprovide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or\nits clients. The Firm determines whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its\ninitial involvement with the VIE and\nreassesses whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it\nhas any continuing involvement with the VIE.\nThis determination is based upon an analysis\nof the design of the VIE, including the VIE\u2019s\nstructure and activities, the power to make\nsignificant economic decisions held by the\nFirm and by other parties, and the variable\ninterests owned by the Firm and other parties.\nThe power to make the most significant\neconomic decisions may take a number of\ndifferent forms in different types of VIEs.\nThe Firm considers servicing or collateral\nmanagement decisions as representing the power\nto make the most significant economic\ndecisions in transactions such as\nsecuritizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm\ndoes not consolidate securitizations or CDOs\nfor which it does not act as the servicer or\ncollateral manager unless it holds certain\nother rights to replace the servicer or\ncollateral manager or to require the\nliquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves\nas servicer or collateral manager, or has\ncertain other rights described in the previous\nsentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in\nthe VIE that it holds and consolidates only\nthose VIEs for which it holds a potentially\nsignificant interest in the VIE. For many\ntransactions, such as re-securitization\ntransactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging\nnotes, there are no significant economic\ndecisions made on an ongoing basis. In these\ncases, the Firm focuses its analysis on\ndecisions made prior to the initial closing of\nthe transaction and at the termination of the\ntransaction. The Firm concluded in most of\nthese transactions that decisions made prior\nto the initial closing were shared between the\nFirm and the initial investors based upon the\nnature of the assets, including whether the\nassets were issued in a transaction sponsored\nby the Firm and the extent of the information\navailable to the Firm and to investors, the\nnumber, nature and involvement of investors,\nother rights held by the Firm and investors,\nthe standardization of the legal documentation\nand the level of continuing involvement by the\nFirm, including the amount and type of\ninterests owned by the Firm and by other\ninvestors. The Firm focused its control\ndecision on any right held by the Firm or\ninvestors related to the termination of the\nVIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs\nand other asset-repackaging notes have no such\ntermination rights.\n                                  \n  129    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nConsolidated VIE\nAssets and Liabilities\nby Type of Activity\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        VIE       VIE       VIE       VIE  \n  in       As\u2026       Li\u2026       As\u2026       Li\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  597    $  256    $  1,\u2026    $  520  \n  I\u2026       753       502       638       272  \n  v\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026       582       520       371       322  \n  O\u2026       378        97       519       199  \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n                                              \nMTOB\u2014Municipal tender\noption bonds\n1.

The purchase of the\ntransferred assets by the SPE is financed\nthrough the sale of these interests. In many\nsecuritization transactions involving\ncommercial mortgage loans, the Firm transfers\na portion of the assets to the SPE with\nunrelated parties transferring the remaining\nassets. In addition, mainly in securitization\ntransactions involving residential mortgage\nloans, the Firm may also enter into derivative\ntransactions, primarily interest rate swaps or\ninterest rate caps, with the SPE. Although not\nobligated, the Firm generally makes a market\nin the securities issued by SPEs in\nsecuritization transactions. As a market\nmaker, the Firm offers to buy these securities\nfrom, and sell these securities to, investors.\nSecurities purchased through these market-\nmaking activities are not considered to be\nretained interests; these beneficial interests\ngenerally are included in Trading\nassets\u2014Corporate and other debt and are\nmeasured at fair value. The Firm enters into\nderivatives, generally interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate caps, with a senior payment\npriority in many securitization transactions.\nThe risks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas similar derivatives with non-SPE\ncounterparties and are managed as part of the\nFirm\u2019s overall exposure. See Note 6 for\nfurther information on derivative instruments\nand hedging activities. Investment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs\nwithin the Investment securities portfolio.\nThese securities are composed of those related\nto transactions sponsored by the federal\nmortgage agencies and predominantly the most\nsenior\n\nsecurities issued by VIEs backed by student\nloans and commercial mortgage loans.\nTransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies include an explicit or implicit\nguarantee provided by the U.S. government.\nAdditionally, the Firm holds certain\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities issued\nby VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's\nsecuritization activities. See Note 7 for\nfurther information on the Investment\nsecurities portfolio. Municipal Tender Option\nBond Trusts In a municipal tender option bond\ntrust transaction, the client transfers a\nmunicipal bond to a trust. The trust issues\nshort-term securities that the Firm, as the\nremarketing agent, sells to investors. The\nclient generally retains a residual interest.\nThe short-term securities are supported by a\nliquidity facility pursuant to which the\ninvestors may put their short-term interests.\nIn most programs, a third-party provider will\nprovide such liquidity facility; in some\nprograms, the Firm provides this liquidity\nfacility. The Firm may, in lieu of purchasing\nshort-term securities for remarketing, decide\nto extend a temporary loan to the trust. The\nclient can generally terminate the transaction\nat any time. The liquidity provider can\ngenerally terminate the transaction upon the\noccurrence of certain events. When the\ntransaction is terminated, the municipal bond\nis generally sold or returned to the client.\nAny losses suffered by the liquidity provider\nupon the sale of the bond are the\nresponsibility of the client. This obligation\nis generally collateralized. Liquidity\nfacilities provided to municipal tender option\nbond trusts are classified as derivatives. The\nFirm consolidates any municipal tender option\nbond trusts in which it holds the residual\ninterest. Credit Protection Purchased through\nCredit-Linked Notes CLN transactions are\ndesigned to provide investors with exposure to\ncertain credit risk on referenced assets. In\nthese transactions, the Firm transfers assets\n(generally high-quality securities or money-\nmarket investments) to an SPE, enters into a\nderivative transaction in which the SPE sells\nprotection on an unrelated referenced asset or\ngroup of assets, through a credit derivative,\nand sells the securities issued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may\nalso enter into interest rate or currency\nswaps with the SPE. Depending on the\nstructure, the assets and liabilities of the\nSPE may be consolidated and recognized in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or accounted for as a\nsale of assets. Upon the occurrence of a\ncredit event related to the referenced asset,\nthe SPE will deliver securities collateral as\npayment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to\nchanges in the collateral\u2019s value. Derivative\npayments by the SPE are collateralized. The\nrisks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas those with non-SPE counterparties and are\nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall\nexposure.\n                                  \n  131    December 2023 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nOther Structured Financings The Firm invests\nin interests issued by entities that develop\nand own low-income communities (including low-\nincome housing projects) and entities that\nconstruct and own facilities that will\ngenerate energy from renewable resources. The\ninterests entitle the Firm to a share of tax\ncredits and tax losses generated by these\nprojects. In addition, the Firm has issued\nguarantees to investors in certain low-income\nhousing funds. The guarantees are designed to\nreturn an investor\u2019s contribution to a fund\nand the investor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax\ncredits expected to be generated by the fund.\nThe Firm is also involved with entities\ndesigned to provide tax-efficient yields to\nthe Firm or its clients. Collateralized Loan\nand Debt Obligations CLOs and CDOs are SPEs\nthat purchase a pool of assets consisting of\ncorporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or\nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through\nderivatives and issue multiple tranches of\ndebt and equity securities to investors. The\nFirm underwrites the securities issued in\ncertain CLO transactions on behalf of\nunaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory\nservices to these unaffiliated sponsors. The\nFirm sells corporate loans to many of these\nSPEs, in some cases representing a significant\nportion of the total assets purchased.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally\nmakes a market in the securities issued by\nSPEs in these transactions and may retain\nunsold securities. These beneficial interests\nare included in Trading assets and are\nmeasured at fair value. Equity-Linked Notes\nELN transactions are designed to provide\ninvestors with exposure to certain risks\nrelated to the specific equity security,\nequity index or other index. In an ELN\ntransaction, the Firm typically transfers to\nan SPE either a note issued by the Firm, the\npayments on which are linked to the\nperformance of a specific equity security,\nequity index or other index, or debt\nsecurities issued by other companies and a\nderivative contract, the terms of which will\nrelate to the performance of a specific equity\nsecurity, equity index or other index. These\nELN transactions with SPEs were not\nconsolidated at December 31, 2023 or December\n31, 2022.\nTransferred Assets\nwith Continuing\nInvolvement\n                                              \n

Regulatory Requirements Regulatory Capital\nFramework The Firm is an FHC under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and\nis subject to the regulation and oversight of\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal\nReserve establishes capital requirements for\nthe Firm, including \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance\nwith such capital requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries, including, among others, MSBNA\nand MSPBNA (together, \u201cU.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries\u201d). The regulatory capital\nrequirements are largely based on the Basel\nIII capital standards established by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision and also\nimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct. In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s regulated\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital\nrequirements, including regulated subsidiaries\nregistered as swap dealers with the CFTC or\nconditionally registered as security-based\nswap dealers with the SEC or registered as\nbroker-dealers or futures commission\nmerchants. Regulatory Capital Requirements The\nFirm is required to maintain minimum risk-\nbased and leverage-based capital ratios under\nregulatory capital requirements. A summary of\nthe calculations of regulatory capital and RWA\nfollows. Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Risk-\nbased capital ratio requirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital\nand Total capital (which includes Tier 2\ncapital), each as a percentage of RWA, and\nconsist of regulatory minimum required ratios\nplus the Firm\u2019s capital buffer requirement.\nCapital requirements require certain\nadjustments to, and deductions from, capital\nfor purposes of determining these ratios. CECL\nDeferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the\nFirm elected to defer the effect of the\nadoption of CECL on its risk-based and\nleverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as\nwell as RWA, adjusted average assets and\nsupplementary leverage exposure calculations,\nover a five-year transition period.

The U.S.\nQualified Plan assets\nrepresent 87% and 88%\nof the Firm\u2019s total\npension plan assets at\nDecember 31, 2023 and\nDecember 2022,\nrespectively. The U.S.\nQualified Plan uses a\ncombination of active\nand risk-controlled\nfixed income\ninvestment strategies.\nThe fixed income asset\nallocation consists\nprimarily of fixed\nincome securities and\nrelated derivative\ninstruments designed\nto approximate the\nexpected cash flows of\nthe plan\u2019s liabilities\nto help reduce plan\nexposure to interest\nrate variation and to\nbetter align assets\nwith the obligation.\nThe longer-duration\nfixed income\nallocation is expected\nto help protect the\nplan\u2019s funded status\nand maintain the\nstability of plan\ncontributions over the\nlong run. The\ninvestment portfolio\nperformance is\nassessed by comparing\nactual investment\nperformance with\nchanges in the\nestimated present\nvalue of the U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nbenefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments\nare permitted in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio\nonly to the extent\nthat they comply with\nall of the plan\u2019s\ninvestment policy\nguidelines and are\nconsistent with the\nplan\u2019s risk and return\nobjectives. As a\nfundamental operating\nprinciple, any\nrestrictions on the\nunderlying assets\napply to the\nrespective derivative\nproduct. This includes\npercentage allocations\nand credit quality.\nDerivatives are used\nsolely for the purpose\nof enhancing\n                                  \n  December 2023 Form 10-K    142  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ninvestment returns in\nthe underlying assets\nand not to circumvent\nportfolio\nrestrictions. Plan\nassets are measured at\nfair value using\nvaluation techniques\nthat are consistent\nwith the valuation\ntechniques applied to\nthe Firm\u2019s major\ncategories of assets\nand liabilities as\ndescribed in Notes 2\nand 4. OTC derivative\ncontracts consist of\ninvestments in\ninterest rate swaps\nand total return\nswaps. Other\ninvestments consist of\ninsurance contracts\nheld by non-U.S.-based\nplans. The insurance\ncontracts are valued\nbased on the premium\nreserve of the insurer\nfor a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given\nto the employee\nbenefit plan that\napproximates fair\nvalue. The insurance\ncontracts are\ncategorized in Level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nprivately offered\nfunds regulated,\nsupervised and subject\nto periodic\nexamination by a U.S.\nfederal or state\nagency and available\nto institutional\nclients. The trust\nmust be maintained for\nthe collective\ninvestment or\nreinvestment of assets\ncontributed to it from\nU.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans\nmaintained by more\nthan one employer or\ncontrolled group of\ncorporations. The\nsponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds\nvalues the funds based\non the fair value of\nthe underlying\nsecurities. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nredeemable at NAV at\nthe measurement date\nor in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based\nplans hold foreign\nfunds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed\nincome funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed\nincome funds are\ndesigned to provide a\nseries of fixed annual\ncash flows achieved by\ninvesting in\ngovernment and\ncorporate bonds.\nLiquidity funds place\na high priority on\ncapital preservation,\nstable value and a\nhigh liquidity of\nassets.
