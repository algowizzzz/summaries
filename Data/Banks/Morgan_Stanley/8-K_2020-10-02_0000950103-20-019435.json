Other Matters.\n\nThe following risk factors supplement the\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nin Part I, Item 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\n\nOur ability to realize the anticipated\nbenefits and synergies from the acquisition of\nE*TRADE involves a number of risks.\n\nOur acquisition and integration of E*TRADE\ninvolves a number\nof risks, including failure to realize\nanticipated benefits and synergies of the\nacquisition and difficulty integrating the two\nbusinesses, including our inability to\nsuccessfully combine E*TRADE\u2019s businesses with\nours, to rationalize technology platforms,\nto achieve expected cost savings and funding\nbenefits, and the assumption of known and\nunknown liabilities of E*TRADE. It is possible\nthat the integration process could also result\nin unanticipated disruption to the E*TRADE\ndirect-to-consumer online platform, the\nloss of key Morgan Stanley or E*TRADE\nemployees, the loss of clients, or an overall\nintegration process that takes longer than\noriginally anticipated.\n\nWe will be subject to increased risks\nassociated with E*TRADE\u2019s businesses and\ndirect-to-consumer model.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition we will be\nsubject to increased\nexposure to risks associated with the direct-\nto-consumer retail brokerage services\nindustry. Changes in interest rates and our\ninability to manage interest rate risk in our\nretail securities business could negatively\nimpact the profitability of this business.\nIn addition, changes in business, economic,\npolitical, or competitive conditions could\ncause a downturn in the global financial\nmarkets, and such a downturn could decrease\nthe volume of customer transactions, result in\na reduction of cash or securities balances\nheld in E*TRADE accounts, reduce demand for\nmargin lending or increase pricing pressure,\nwhich may, in turn, result in lower net\ninterest income, trading-based revenue, fees\nand service charges.\n\nFurther, E*TRADE\u2019s customers primarily conduct\nfinancial\ntransactions over the internet and through\nmobile services, which may expose us to\nincreased operational risks, including\ntechnological\nfailures, cyber-attacks, privacy breaches,\nhuman error or fraud. In addition,\nextraordinary trading volumes or site usage\ncould\ncause our systems to operate at an\nunacceptably slow speed or even fail.\nDisruptions to, destruction of, instability of\nor other\nfailure to effectively maintain our\ninformation technology systems or external\ntechnology that allows retail customers to use\nbrokerage\nproducts and services could harm our business\nand our reputation. We will also need to\nmanage additional regulatory and compliance\nrisks associated with E*TRADE\u2019s direct-to-\nconsumer business.\n\nItem 9.01.
