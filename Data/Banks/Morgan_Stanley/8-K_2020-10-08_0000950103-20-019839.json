Entry into a Material Definitive\nAgreement\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\n\nOverview\n\nOn October 7, 2020, Eaton Vance Corp., a\nMaryland corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), entered\ninto an Agreement\nand Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d)\nwith Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation\n(\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d),\nMirror Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Maryland\ncorporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMorgan Stanley (\u201cMerger Sub 1\u201d),\nand Mirror Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Maryland\nlimited liability company and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Morgan Stanley (\u201cMerger Sub 2\u201d).\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions\nof the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 will\nmerge with and into\nthe Company (the \u201cFirst Merger\u201d), with the\nCompany surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Morgan Stanley,\nand (ii) immediately following the completion\nof the First Merger, the surviving corporation\nfrom the First Merger will merge with\nand into Merger Sub 2 (the \u201cSecond Merger\u201d\nand, together with the First Merger, the\n\u201cMergers\u201d),\nwith Merger Sub 2 surviving the Second Merger\nand continuing as a wholly owned direct\nsubsidiary of Morgan Stanley. For U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, each of the parties to\nthe Merger Agreement intends that the First\nMerger and the Second Merger, considered\ntogether as a single integrated transaction\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, will\nqualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended. Entry into the Merger Agreement\nwas unanimously approved by the Board of\nDirectors of each of Morgan Stanley and the\nCompany.\n\nFollowing the execution and delivery of\nthe Merger Agreement, on October 7, 2020, the\nvoting trust (the \u201cCompany Voting Trust\u201d)\ngoverned by the Voting\nTrust Agreement dated as of October 30, 1997,\nas the sole holder of the voting common stock,\npar value $0.00390625 per share, of\nthe Company (\u201cCompany Voting Common Stock\u201d),\napproved and adopted the Merger Agreement (the\n\u201cCompany Stockholder Approval\u201d). No further\napproval of the stockholders of the Company is\nrequired to adopt the Merger Agreement\nor to approve the Mergers or the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement.\n\nMerger Consideration\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the\neffective time of the First Merger (the\n\u201cEffective Time\u201d), each share of non-voting\ncommon stock, par value\n$0.00390625 per share, of the Company\n(\u201cCompany Non-Voting Common Stock\u201d and,\ntogether with the Company Voting\nCommon Stock, the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) and\neach share of Company Voting Common Stock\nissued and outstanding\nimmediately before the Effective Time (other\nthan certain shares of Company Common Stock\nheld by Morgan Stanley or a subsidiary\nof the Company), will convert into, at the\nelection of the holder thereof, the right to\nreceive the following consideration (the\nconsideration such holder elects, the \u201cMerger\nConsideration\u201d): (i) (a) 0.5833 shares of\ncommon stock of Morgan\nStanley, par value $0.01 per share (\u201cMorgan\nStanley Common Stock\u201d), and (b) $28.25 in cash\n(the \u201cMixed Consideration\u201d); (ii) an amount of\ncash, without interest (the \u201cCash\nConsideration\u201d), equal to the\nsum (rounded to two decimal places) of (a)\n$28.25 and (b) the product obtained by\nmultiplying 0.5833 by the volume-weighted\naverage\nprice (rounded to four decimal places) of one\nshare of Morgan Stanley Common Stock on the\nNew York Stock Exchange for the period\nof the ten consecutive trading days ending on\nthe second full trading day prior to the\nEffective Time (the \u201cMorgan Stanley Common\nStock Reference Price\u201d); or (iii) a number of\nshares of Morgan Stanley Common Stock (the\n\u201cStock Consideration\u201d)\nequal to the sum of (a) 0.5833 and (b) the\nquotient (rounded to four decimal places)\nobtained by dividing $28.25 by the Morgan\nStanley Common Stock Reference Price. The\nMerger Consideration to be paid to holders of\nCompany Common Stock who do not make an\nelection will be the Mixed Consideration.

Unlisted factors may present\nsignificant\nadditional obstacles to the realization of\nforward-looking statements. Consequences of\nmaterial differences in results as compared\nwith those anticipated in the forward-looking\nstatements could include, among other things,\nbusiness disruption, operational problems,\nfinancial loss, legal liability to third\nparties and similar risks, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on Morgan\nStanley\u2019s or Eaton Vance\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition, results of operations,\ncredit rating or liquidity.
