Gorman                             \n                                              \nMorgan Stanley delivered record financial     \nperformance in 2021 with strong growth across \nits businesses and geographies. Fiscal        \nstimulus and the reopening of many parts of   \nthe global economy led to robust economic     \ngrowth and a favorable market environment in  \n2021. Amidst this backdrop, and with a strong \nfocus on our clients, we delivered record     \nfinancial results \u2014 our fourth consecutive    \nyear of earnings growth. For the full year, we\nreported record revenues of $59.8 billion and \nrecord net income of $15.0 billion, producing \na return on average tangible common equity    \n(ROTCE) of 19.8%. The Firm\u2019s performance in   \n2021 exceeded our expectations. As a result,  \nwe were able to achieve all of the two-year   \nobjectives that we had set out for ourselves  \nat the beginning of the year. We have built a \nsustainable business model with both scale and\nmomentum, and our diversified global franchise\nis well positioned for long-term success. Our \nstrong brand and franchise are generating     \ntangible results as we collaborate across our \nsegments with a coordinated, client-focused   \napproach. The acquisitions of E*TRADE and     \nEaton Vance have advanced our growth strategy,\ncapping a 12-year transformation of Morgan    \nStanley into a more balanced company,         \nproducing higher returns, and pivoting to     \nlong-term, sustainable growth. Our total      \nrevenues have more than doubled since 2009    \nwith each business having grown significantly \nand contributing to the Firm\u2019s enhanced       \nprofitability. We have built unique           \ncompetitive advantages around each of our     \nbusinesses and we expect to grow and maintain \nour leading positions. In Institutional       \nSecurities, our competitive position is       \nstrong, and we are confident in our ability to\ncapitalize on opportunities to hold, if not   \ngain, share across the division. Share        \ncontinues to aggregate to the industry        \nleaders, and we expect this trend to persist. \nOur businesses are interconnected and         \nintegrated, delivering the entire Firm to all \nof our clients. Our Wealth and Investment     \nManagement businesses together held $6.5      \ntrillion in client assets at the end of 2021. \nWe have significant scale advantages in these \nbusinesses, and they will benefit             \nsubstantially as rates rise over the next     \nseveral years. Our longer-term goal is to grow\nthese assets to $10 trillion. The earnings    \npower underlining these businesses will serve \nas an economic engine for the Firm for decades\nto come. We have meaningfully and with intent \ntransformed our business model over the past  \n12 years, and are laser focused on delivering \nvalue to our clients, shareholders, and       \nemployees. We have scale, significant growth  \nopportunities in Wealth and Investment        \nManagement coupled with a leading             \nInstitutional business, strong brands that    \nexpand our footprint, and a commitment to     \ncapital return. While it is difficult to      \npredict the economic environment in the short \nterm, we believe unambiguously that Morgan    \nStanley is in its growth phase. Our future    \ngrowth and success will be guided by the depth\nof talent and leadership that exists across   \nour Firm. It is our employees who will drive  \nour business growth and sustain our culture. I\nam confident that our senior management team  \nis strong and experienced. They are all long- \nterm culture carriers with proven leadership, \nwho will continue to build on our momentum. We\nalso have a deep bench of talent within both  \nthe business and infrastructure sides of the  \nFirm, and we are committed to investing in    \nthem and their success.                       \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT1  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Building an increasingly    \ndiverse workforce remains central to our      \nvalues, and we are continuing to take steps to\nensure that our employees reflect the         \ndemographics of the communities in which we   \nlive and work. With the recent acquisitions of\nE*TRADE and Eaton Vance, we have welcomed     \nthousands of employees to the Morgan Stanley  \nfranchise. As we continue to integrate these  \ngreat organizations within our businesses, we \nremain committed to creating a diverse and    \nequitable work environment where all employees\ncan reach their highest potential and feel a  \nsense of belonging. Our Board of Directors and\nmanagement value the views of our shareholders\nand engage with them year round on a broad    \nrange of topics, including our strategy,      \nfinancial performance, executive compensation,\ncorporate governance, human capital management\nand environmental and social goals. At the    \nannual meeting, Nobuyuki Hirano will step down\nfrom our Board and we are nominating Masato   \nMiyachi to replace him as an MUFG director    \nrepresentative. I would like to thank Mr.     \nHirano for his many years of extraordinary    \nservice stretching back to the founding of our\nunique, more than decade-long strategic       \npartnership with MUFG. I know we will benefit \nfrom Mr. Miyachi\u2019s years of corporate and     \ninvestment banking experience. Elizabeth      \nCorley is also stepping down from the Board.  \nShe most recently served on the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee, and I would like to     \nthank Ms. Corley for her contributions to the \nBoard. I hope you will read my Letter to      \nShareholders where I discuss our achievements \nand opportunities for the future in greater   \ndetail. I look forward to hearing from you at \nthe annual meeting next month. Please continue\nto stay healthy. Thank you for your support of\nMorgan Stanley.

                                       \nPERFORMANCE-BASED APPROACH TO COMPENSATION AND\n2021 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS As in prior years,\nthe CMDS Committee used a well-defined        \nframework to determine CEO compensation for   \n2021, including establishing a target         \ncompensation range for the CEO and guidelines \nfor the CEO performance assessment, including \nperformance priorities based on the Company\u2019s \nstrategic objectives. Based on an evaluation  \nof CEO performance and record Company         \nfinancial performance in 2021, including      \nmeeting or exceeding its two-year objectives, \nand executing on the next phase of            \ntransformational growth and shareholder value,\nthe CMDS Committee set CEO total compensation \nat $35 million, with shareholder-aligned      \nfeatures. Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership, for  \n2021:                                         \n                                              \n     The Company achieved record financial    \n     performance in terms of revenues,        \n     profits before tax and earnings per      \n     share. The Company also reported full    \n  \u2022  year ROTCE, efficiency ratio, and        \n     Wealth Management Pre-Tax Margin, each   \n     excluding integration expenses, meeting  \n     or exceeding the Company\u2019s two-year      \n     objectives.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     The market recognized the Company\u2019s      \n     continuing transformation and growth,    \n     as reflected in strong relative          \n     performance in TSR versus peers in 2021  \n  \u2022  and top performance over 3- and 5-year   \n     periods. The Company\u2019s share price       \n     increased 43% and market cap increased   \n     by approximately $50\u00a0billion to $174\u00a0    \n     billion.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Company continued to increase        \n  \u2022  returns to shareholders, including a     \n     doubling of the annualized dividend.     \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Company continued to execute on its  \n     strategic transformation to drive        \n     significant growth in each of its        \n  \u2022  businesses, including continuing to      \n     successfully integrate its E*TRADE       \n     Financial Corporation (E*TRADE) and      \n     Eaton Vance Corp.

For\n2021, the portion of Mr. Gorman\u2019s incentive   \ncompensation delivered in performance-vested  \nequity was increased from 50% to 60%. In      \naddition, the CMDS Committee increased the MS \nAverage ROTCE threshold of the 2022\u20132024      \nperformance-vested equity awards from 15% to  \n16% in order to earn a maximum payout of 1.5  \ntimes this portion of the award, reflecting   \nthe transformative changes to the business    \nlast year. Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership, our \nbusiness model performed and achieved record  \nresults. The Company achieved record financial\nperformance in terms of revenues, profits     \nbefore tax and earnings per share. Company net\nrevenues were $59.8 billion with net income   \napplicable to Morgan Stanley of $15.0 billion,\nand earnings per share were $8.03.            \n                                        \n  8MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nIn addition, the Company continued to execute \non growth objectives.

In making progress on the Company\u2019s \nlong-term strategic objectives to provide a   \nsustainable business model with growth        \nmomentum, the Company also met or exceeded its\ntwo-year objectives for ROTCE, efficiency     \nratio and Wealth Management Pre-Tax Margin, in\neach case excluding integration costs.        \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT9  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nThe Company also continued to increase returns\nto shareholders. The annualized dividend was  \ndoubled in 2021 to $2.80, while the Company   \nrepurchased $11 billion in shares. The Company\ncontinues to maintain excess capital that     \npositions it well for future growth. 2021 CEO \nCOMPENSATION DETERMINATION The 2021 pay       \ndecision for the CEO was made by the CMDS     \nCommittee, in consultation with the Board,    \nfollowing its assessment of Mr. Gorman\u2019s      \noutstanding individual performance and record \nCompany financial performance, including      \nmeeting or exceeding its two-year objectives  \nannounced in January 2021, and executing on   \nthe next phase of transformational growth and \nshareholder value. Company and CEO performance\nin 2021 were strong, and the CMDS Committee   \ndetermined that a 2021 pay decision for Mr.   \nGorman of $35 million, up from $33 million in \n2020, was appropriate. CEO compensation was   \ndelivered in a combination of base salary,    \ncash bonus, a time-vested deferred equity     \nincentive compensation award, and a           \nperformance-vested equity incentive           \ncompensation award. A significant portion of  \nCEO pay is deferred, all of which is awarded  \nin equity, subject to future stock price      \nperformance, cancellation and clawback and, in\nthe case of the performance-vested equity     \naward, subject to future achievement of       \nspecified financial goals over a three-year   \nperiod. The CMDS Committee believes this      \napproach to executive compensation supports   \nthe Company\u2019s pay for performance philosophy  \nand key compensation objectives, and is       \nconsistent with shareholder feedback, best    \npractices and regulatory principles.          \n                                         \n  10MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nSHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT At our 2021 annual     \nmeeting of shareholders, approximately 96% of \nthe votes cast were in favor of our annual    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In anticipation of the \n2022 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote, we continued our      \nengagement program, seeking feedback from     \nshareholders and proxy advisory firms on a    \nvariety of topics, including executive        \ncompensation, corporate governance and        \nenvironmental and social goals. With respect  \nto executive compensation, shareholders who   \nprovided feedback during our engagement       \nprogram generally praised the quality of the  \nCompany\u2019s disclosure and reported that the    \nCommittee\u2019s use of discretion in the          \nadministration of the program is reasonable   \nand that executive compensation at Morgan     \nStanley is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. After carefully considering      \nshareholder feedback and other factors, the   \nCMDS Committee maintained its performance-    \nbased approach to executive compensation for  \n2021 and increased the proportion of incentive\ncompensation granted to the CEO in the form of\nperformance-vested stock unit awards from 50% \nto 60%. In addition, as discussed in Section  \n4.2 of the CD&A, the CMDS Committee increased \nthe MS Average ROTCE threshold of the         \n2022\u20132024 performance-vested equity awards    \nfrom 15% to 16% in order to earn a maximum    \npayout of 1.5 times this portion of the award,\nreflecting the transformative changes to the  \nbusiness last year.                           \n                                              \n  Item 4                                      \n          Shareholder Proposal                \n          \u2612Our Board unanimously recommends   \n          that you vote \u2018\u2018AGAINST\u201dthe         \n          shareholder proposal requesting     \n          adoption of a policy to cease       \n          financing new fossil fuel           \n          development.                        \n          See page91for the shareholder       \n          proposal and our Board\u2019s            \n          opposition statement.               \n                                              \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT11  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nCorporate Governance Matters                  \n                                              \n  Item 1                                      \n          Election of Directors               \n          Our Board unanimously recommends    \n          that you vote\u201cFOR\u201dthe election of   \n          all director nominees.              \n                                              \nDirector Succession and Nomination Process KEY\nSTATISTICS ON BOARD SUCCESSION                \n                                              \n  5.5\u00a0years      63.9\u00a0years                5  \n  Average                                new  \n  tenure of      Average age       directors  \n  Board          of Board             in the  \n  upon           upon             last three  \n  election       election at           years  \n  at             annual           (since the  \n  annual         meeting           beginning  \n  meeting                           of 2019)  \n                                              \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee\u2019s     \ncharter provides that the committee will      \nactively seek and identify nominees for       \nrecommendation to the Board consistent with   \nthe criteria in the Morgan Stanley Corporate  \nGovernance Policies (Corporate Governance     \nPolicies), which provide that the Board values\nmembers who:                                  \n                                              \n     Combine a broad spectrum of experience   \n  \u2022  and expertise with a reputation for      \n     integrity.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Have experience in positions with a      \n     high degree of responsibility.           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Are leaders in the companies or          \n  \u2022  institutions with which they are         \n     affiliated.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Can make contributions to the Board and  \n     management.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  Represent the interests of               \n     shareholders.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Possess a willingness to appropriately   \n  \u2022  challenge management in a constructive   \n     manner.                                  \n                                              \nWhile the Board has not adopted a formal      \nwritten policy regarding director diversity,  \nthe Corporate Governance Policies provide that\nthe Board will take into account the diversity\nof a director candidate\u2019s perspectives,       \nbackground, work experience and other         \ndemographics, including race, gender,         \nethnicity and nationality. In considering     \npotential candidates for the Board, the       \nNominating and Governance Committee considers \nthe extent to which a candidate contributes to\nthe diversity of the Board. The Nominating and\nGovernance Committee and the Board may also   \ndetermine specific skills and experience they \nare seeking in director candidates based on   \nthe needs of the Company in light of the      \nCompany\u2019s long-term strategy. In considering  \ncandidates for the Board, the Nominating and  \nGovernance Committee considers the entirety of\neach candidate\u2019s credentials in the context of\nthese criteria. The Board is committed to the \nongoing review of Board composition and       \ndirector succession planning. The Nominating  \nand Governance Committee continuously reviews \nthe experience, qualifications, attributes,   \nskills, race, gender, ethnicity, nationality  \nand tenure of the members of the Board and    \nmaintains a list of potential director        \ncandidates that is reviewed and refreshed     \nregularly throughout the course of the year.  \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee may   \nretain and terminate, in its sole discretion, \na third party to assist in identifying        \ndirector candidates or gathering information  \nregarding a director candidate\u2019s background   \nand experience.

Members of the Nominating and       \nGovernance Committee, the Independent Lead    \nDirector and other members of the Board       \ninterview potential director candidates as    \npart of the selection process when evaluating \nnew director candidates.                      \n                                         \n  12MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nThe Corporate Governance Policies provide that\nthe Board expects a director to advise the    \nChairman and Corporate Secretary if he or she \nplans to join the board of directors or       \nsimilar governing body of another public or   \nprivate company or advisory board, or         \nexperiences other changed circumstances that  \ncould diminish his or her effectiveness as a  \ndirector or otherwise be detrimental to the   \nCompany. They also provide that the Board     \nexpects a director to advise and to offer to  \ntender his or her resignation for             \nconsideration by the Board if his or her      \nprincipal occupation or employer changes. In  \naddition, the Corporate Governance Policies   \nprovide that a director candidate should not  \nbe nominated for election if the candidate    \nwould be 72 years old or older at the time of \nelection. Our Board currently includes two    \ndirectors (Messrs. Hirano and Kamezawa) who   \nare designated in accordance with the terms of\nthe Investor Agreement between Morgan Stanley \nand MUFG, dated October 13, 2008, as amended  \nand restated (Investor Agreement), pursuant to\nwhich Morgan Stanley agreed to take all lawful\naction to cause two of MUFG\u2019s senior officers \nor directors to become members of Morgan      \nStanley\u2019s Board. Nobuyuki Hirano, the former  \nChair and President and Group CEO of MUFG, who\nhas served on the Board since November 2015   \nand also previously served from 2009 through  \n2011, will not be standing for re-election at \nthe 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. The  \nBoard thanks Mr. Hirano for his service and   \ncontributions to Morgan Stanley. MUFG has     \ndesignated Masato Miyachi, Deputy President   \nand Chief Executive of Global Corporate and   \nInvestment Banking of MUFG Bank, as a         \nrepresentative director under the Investor    \nAgreement to stand for election, along with   \nMUFG\u2019s other representative director, Hironori\nKamezawa, President and Group CEO of MUFG, at \nthe 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. The  \nNominating and Governance Committee considered\nthe experience, qualifications and skills of  \nMr. Miyachi, including his over 35 years of   \ninternational banking experience and financial\nservices, risk management and sustainability  \nexpertise, and unanimously recommended that   \nthe Board nominate Mr. Miyachi as a director  \nfor election at the 2022 annual meeting of    \nshareholders. Based on the recommendation of  \nthe Nominating and Governance Committee, the  \nBoard unanimously nominated and recommends    \nthat Mr. Miyachi be elected as a director at  \nthe 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. As   \npreviously disclosed, Elizabeth Corley, who   \nhas served on the Board since 2018, will      \nconclude service on the Board on or about     \nApril 27, 2022 and will not be standing for   \nre-election at the 2022 annual meeting of     \nshareholders. The Board thanks Ms. Corley for \nher service and contributions to Morgan       \nStanley.

In each   \n     case the provision of such products and  \n     services was in compliance with the      \n     Director Independence Standards and the  \n     NYSE rules and was considered            \n     immaterial to director independence.     \n                                              \nDirector Attendance at Annual Meeting The     \nCorporate Governance Policies state that      \ndirectors are expected to attend annual       \nmeetings of shareholders.

The Board or the Operations and  \nTechnology Committee reviews and approves the \nGlobal Cybersecurity Program Policy, the      \nGlobal Information Security Program Policy and\nthe Global Technology Policy at least         \nannually. The Chair of the Operations and     \nTechnology Committee regularly reports to the \nBoard on cybersecurity risks and other matters\nreviewed by the Operations and Technology     \nCommittee. In addition, the Board receives    \nseparate presentations on cybersecurity risk  \nand all Board members are invited to attend   \nOperations and Technology Committee meetings  \nand have access to meeting materials. Senior  \nmanagement, including the senior officers     \nmentioned above, discuss cybersecurity        \ndevelopments with the Chairs of the Operations\nand Technology Committee and the Risk         \nCommittee between Board and committee         \nmeetings, as necessary. The Operations and    \nTechnology Committee meets regularly in       \nexecutive session with management, including  \nthe CRO, COO and senior officers from         \nTechnology, Operations and Firm Resilience    \nDepartment. ASSESSMENT OF LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE\nAND RISK OVERSIGHT The Board has determined   \nthat its leadership structure is appropriate  \nfor the Company. Mr. Gorman\u2019s role as CEO, his\nexisting relationship with the Board, his     \nunderstanding of Morgan Stanley\u2019s businesses  \nand strategy, and his professional experience \nand leadership skills uniquely position him to\nserve as Chairman, while the Company\u2019s        \nIndependent Lead Director position enhances   \nthe overall independent functioning of the    \nBoard. The Board believes that the combination\nof the Chairman and CEO, the Independent Lead \nDirector and the Chairs of the Audit, CMDS,   \nNominating and Governance, Operations and     \nTechnology, and Risk Committees provides the  \nappropriate leadership to help ensure         \neffective risk oversight by the Board.        \nCompensation Governance and Risk Management   \nThe CMDS Committee actively engages in its    \nduties and follows procedures intended to     \nensure excellence in compensation governance. \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee has the power to      \n     hire and fire independent compensation   \n     consultants, legal counsel, or           \n     financial or other advisors as it may    \n     deem necessary to assist it in the       \n     performance of its duties and            \n     responsibilities. The CMDS Committee     \n     has retained an independent              \n     compensation consultant, Pay             \n     Governance, to assist the CMDS           \n     Committee in collecting and evaluating   \n     external market data regarding           \n     executive compensation and performance   \n     and to advise the CMDS Committee on      \n     developing trends and best practices in  \n  \u2022  executive compensation and equity and    \n     incentive plan design. In performing     \n     these services, Pay Governance attends   \n     meetings of the CMDS Committee           \n     regularly, including portions of the     \n     meetings without management present,     \n     and separately with the CMDS Committee   \n     Chair. Pay Governance is the CMDS        \n     Committee\u2019s independent advisor and      \n     does not provide any other services to   \n     the Company or its executive officers    \n     that could jeopardize its independent    \n     status. The Company has affirmatively    \n     determined that no conflict of interest  \n     has arisen in connection with the work   \n     of Pay Governance as compensation        \n     consultant for the CMDS Committee.       \n                                              \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee regularly reviews     \n     (i)\u00a0Company performance with respect to  \n  \u2022  execution of strategic objectives and    \n     evaluates executive performance in       \n     light of such performance; (ii)\u00a0         \n     executive compensation                   \n                                              \n                                         \n  42MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nstrategy, including the competitive           \nenvironment and the design and structure of   \nthe Company\u2019s compensation programs to ensure \nthat they are consistent with and support our \ncompensation objectives; and (iii) market     \ntrends and legislative and regulatory         \ndevelopments affecting compensation in the    \nU.S. and globally.                            \n                                              \n     Together with the CRO, the CMDS          \n     Committee oversees the Company\u2019s         \n     incentive compensation arrangements to   \n     help ensure that such arrangements are   \n     consistent with the safety and           \n     soundness of the Company and do not      \n     encourage excessive risk-taking, and     \n     are otherwise consistent with            \n     applicable related regulatory rules and  \n     guidance. The CRO attends CMDS           \n  \u2022  Committee meetings at least annually,    \n     and on an as needed basis, to discuss    \n     the risk attributes of the Company\u2019s     \n     incentive compensation arrangements.     \n     The CRO reported to the CMDS Committee   \n     his conclusion that the Company\u2019s        \n     current compensation programs for 2021   \n     do not incentivize employees to take     \n     unnecessary or excessive risk and that   \n     such programs do not create risks that   \n     are reasonably likely to have a          \n     material adverse effect on the Company.  \n                                              \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee approves senior       \n     executive annual incentive compensation  \n     after a comprehensive review and         \n  \u2022  evaluation of Company, business unit     \n     and individual performance for the       \n     year, and reviews these compensation     \n     decisions with our Board.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Together with senior management, the     \n     CMDS Committee oversees the Company\u2019s    \n     controls regarding the year-end          \n     compensation process, which have been    \n     designed to be consistent with our       \n     regulators\u2019 principles for safety and    \n     soundness, including policies and        \n  \u2022  procedures for compensation plan         \n     governance, funding and allocating the   \n     incentive compensation pool and the use  \n     of discretion in determining individual  \n     incentive compensation awards;           \n     processes for identifying \u201crisk-taking\u201d  \n     employees; and processes to administer   \n     incentive compensation clawback and      \n     cancellation features.                   \n                                              \nDirector Compensation Our director            \ncompensation program is guided by three goals:\ncompensation should fairly pay directors for  \nwork required in a company of our size and    \nscope; compensation should align directors\u2019   \ninterests with the long-term interests of     \nshareholders; and the structure of the        \ncompensation should be easy for shareholders  \nto understand. The Board believes that a      \ndirector\u2019s total compensation should include a\nsignificant equity component because it       \nbelieves that this more closely aligns the    \nlong-term interests of directors with those of\nshareholders and provides a continuing        \nincentive for directors to foster the         \nCompany\u2019s success. In furtherance of these    \ngoals, our directors are bound by a           \nshareholder-approved annual compensation (cash\nand equity) limit of $750,000 and an equity   \nownership requirement of five times the annual\ncash Board retainer (as described in more     \ndetail below under \u201cDirector Equity Ownership \nRequirement\u201d). Directors\u2019 compensation is     \ndetermined by the Board, and the Nominating   \nand Governance Committee makes recommendations\nto the Board based on periodic benchmarking   \nassessments and advice received from FW Cook, \nits independent advisor. In 2020, FW Cook     \nconducted a customized review of the design   \nand pay levels of our director compensation   \nprogram compared to competitive market        \npractices. Taking into account our director   \ncompensation program\u2019s emphasis on equity     \ncompensation, our shareholder-approved annual \ncompensation limit, and our equity ownership  \nrequirement, among other features of our      \nprogram, FW Cook determined that our director \ncompensation program remained consistent with \nbest market practices and competitive with the\nmarket and continued to align the interests of\nour non-employee directors with the long-term \ninterests of our shareholders. No changes were\nmade to our director compensation program in  \n2021.                                         \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT43  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nThe following table contains information with \nrespect to the annual compensation (including \ndeferred compensation) of our non-employee    \ndirectors earned during 2021 with respect to  \ntheir Board service.                          \n                                              \n                         C\u2026                   \n         F\u2026              in                   \n         E\u2026              P\u2026                   \n         or      S\u2026      V\u2026      All          \n  \u2026      P\u2026      A\u2026      a\u2026      Ot\u2026      T\u2026  \n         in      (\u2026      N\u2026      Co\u2026      (\u2026  \n         C\u2026              D\u2026      ($)          \n         (\u2026              C\u2026                   \n                         E\u2026                   \n                         (\u2026                   \n  \u2026      9\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      3\u2026       \u2014      \u2014       14\u2026      4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      3\u2026       \u2014      \u2014       18\u2026      5\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      9\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Mr.\u00a0Ogasawara and Ms.\u00a0Olayan concluded   \n     service on the Board effective May\u00a020,   \n     2021, the date of the 2021 annual        \n  *  meeting of shareholders.                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Messrs.

      \n     businesses, which enhances Deloitte &    \n     Touche\u2019s audit efficiency and            \n     effectiveness and enables cost           \n     efficiencies to be obtained.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Deloitte & Touche\u2019s independence from    \n     the Company, noting that (i)\u00a0Deloitte &  \n     Touche does not provide any non-audit    \n     services to the Company other than       \n     those deemed permissible, as described   \n     under \u201cIndependent Auditor Fees\u201d, and    \n     (ii)\u00a0that both the Company and Deloitte  \n  \u2022  & Touche have controls and policies in   \n     place, including related to the          \n     applicable auditor independence rules    \n     and the mandatory rotation of the lead   \n     audit and other engagement partners,     \n     which helps ensure the continued         \n     independence and fresh perspectives of   \n     Deloitte & Touche.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n     Deloitte & Touche\u2019s succession planning  \n  \u2022  for rotation of key Deloitte & Touche    \n     personnel on the engagement.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     The appropriateness of Deloitte &        \n  \u2022  Touche\u2019s fees relative to both audit     \n     quality and efficiency.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     External data on audit quality and       \n     performance, including recent Public     \n  \u2022  Company Accounting Oversight Board       \n     (PCAOB) reports on Deloitte & Touche     \n     and peer firms.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     The potential challenges, impact and     \n     advisability of selecting a different    \n  \u2022  independent auditor, including the time  \n     and expense of transitioning to a new    \n     independent auditor.                     \n                                              \nBased on this review, the Audit Committee has \nappointed Deloitte & Touche as independent    \nauditor for the year ending December 31, 2022 \nand although not legally required to do so    \npresents this selection to the shareholders   \nfor ratification as a matter of governance    \nbest practices. The Audit Committee believes  \nthat the continued retention of Deloitte &    \nTouche is in the best interest of the Company \nand its shareholders. Deloitte & Touche was   \nselected as independent auditor upon the      \nmerger creating the current Company in 1997   \nand has served continuously as independent    \nauditor since that time. Deloitte & Touche    \nwill audit the Company\u2019s consolidated         \nfinancial statements included in the Annual   \nReport on Form 10-K for the year ending       \nDecember 31, 2022 and will perform other      \npermissible, pre-approved services. If        \nshareholders do not ratify the appointment of \nDeloitte & Touche, the Audit Committee will   \nconsider this in determining whether to       \nappoint Deloitte & Touche as independent      \nauditor for the year ending December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche representatives will attend \nthe annual meeting. They will be present to   \nrespond to appropriate shareholder questions  \nand will have the opportunity to make a       \nstatement if they desire to do so.

Based on our review and the\nmeetings, discussions and reports discussed   \nabove, and subject to the limitations on our  \nrole and responsibilities referred to above   \nand in the Audit Committee charter, we        \nrecommended to the Board that the Company\u2019s   \naudited consolidated financial statements for \n2021 be included in the Company\u2019s Annual      \nReport on Form 10-K.

At the 2021 \nannual meeting of stockholders, approximately \n96% of the votes cast were in favor of our    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In light of the        \nsignificant majority of votes cast in favor of\nthe 2020 compensation of our NEOs, the CMDS   \nCommittee maintained its performance-based    \napproach to executive compensation for 2021   \nand believes that our current program         \nappropriately links the compensation of our   \nNEOs to performance and properly aligns the   \ninterests of our NEOs with those of our       \nshareholders. As discussed in the CD&A, the   \n2021 pay decision for the CEO was made by the \nCMDS Committee, in consultation with the      \nBoard. Based on an evaluation of 2021 Company \nand CEO performance, including meeting or     \nexceeding its two-year objectives announced in\nJanuary 2021, and executing on the next phase \nof transformational growth and shareholder    \nvalue, the CMDS Committee set CEO total       \ncompensation for 2021 at $35 million, with    \nshareholder-aligned features.

This amount   \n     differs from the SEC required            \n     disclosure in the \u201c2021 Summary          \n     Compensation Table.\u201d                     \n                                              \nThe alignment of Mr. Gorman\u2019s pay with Company\nperformance can also be demonstrated over the \nlonger term. A significant portion of CEO pay \nis delivered through equity awards, the       \nrealizable value of which increases or        \ndecreases over time with stock price          \nperformance. Mr. Gorman\u2019s total realizable pay\nover the 2019\u20132021 period was approximately   \n44% greater than his total pay as reported in \nthe \u201c2021 Summary Compensation Table\u201d for the \nrelevant years, while the Company\u2019s three-year\nstock price performance for the same period   \nwas higher at 148%. Realizable pay reflects   \nthe current aggregate value of base salary,   \ncash bonus and equity awards disclosed in the \n2019, 2020 and 2021 proxy statements, with    \nequity awards valued using the closing price  \nof the Company\u2019s common stock on December 31, \n2021 and performance-vested awards valued     \nbased on performance at target. NEO pay in a  \ngiven year is typically delivered in a        \ncombination of fixed compensation (base       \nsalary), cash bonus, and deferred incentive   \ncompensation provided in time-vested deferred \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) and a long-term \nincentive program (LTIP) award in the form of \nperformance-vested stock units. In determining\nthe portions of compensation to award as cash \nbonus, deferred incentive compensation, RSUs  \nand LTIP awards, the CMDS Committee considers \napplicable regulatory requirements and        \nguidelines for deferral, as well as market    \npractices and shareholder feedback. A         \nsignificant portion of pay is deferred, all of\nwhich is awarded in equity, subject to future \nstock price performance and cancellation and  \nclawback and, in the case of LTIP awards,     \nsubject to future achievement of specified    \nfinancial objectives over a three-year period.\n                                         \n  60MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThese compensation elements support the       \nCompany\u2019s key compensation objectives,        \ndiscussed in Section 2, including delivering  \npay for sustainable performance.              \n                                              \n                       \u2022\u200775% of 2021 CEO      \n  Deferred Incentive   incentive              \n  Compensation         compensation is        \n                       deferred over three    \n                       years                  \n  \u2022 Clawbacks cover                           \n  material adverse                            \n  outcomes, even                              \n  absent misconduct                           \n  \u2022 No automatic                              \n  vesting on change                           \n  in                                          \n  control; double                             \n  trigger in place                            \n                       \u2022\u2007100% of CEO          \n  Equity-Based         deferred incentive     \n  Compensation         compensation awarded   \n                       in equity              \n  \u2022\u2007Significant                               \n  portion of                                  \n  equity-based                                \n  compensation aligns                         \n  employee and                                \n  shareholder                                 \n  interests                                   \n  \u2022 Meaningful share                          \n  ownership and                               \n  retention                                   \n  requirements                                \n  further                                     \n  shareholder                                 \n  alignment                                   \n                       \u2022\u200760% of CEO 2021      \n                       incentive              \n                       compensation is        \n  Performance-Vested   performance-vested,    \n  Equity Incentive     an increase from       \n  Award                50% for 2020,          \n                       consistent with        \n                       shareholder            \n                       feedback(new)          \n  \u2022\u2007Shares earned can                         \n  range from 0 to                             \n  1.5x target based                           \n  on three-year                               \n  performance against                         \n  ROTCE and TSR                               \n  objectives                                  \n  \u2022\u2007For 2021,                                 \n  increased ROTCE                             \n  threshold required                          \n  to achieve the 1.5x                         \n  multiplier from 15%                         \n  to 16%(new)                                 \n                       \u2022\u2007Prohibitions on      \n  Best Practices       pledging, hedging,     \n                       selling short or       \n                       trading derivatives    \n  \u2022 No excise tax                             \n  protection upon a                           \n  change                                      \n  in control                                  \n  \u2022\u2007Annual risk                               \n  review                                      \n  \u2022 CMDS Committee                            \n  retains independent                         \n  compensation                                \n  consultant                                  \n                                              \nSection 4.1 contains the compensation         \ndecisions (both the amount and mix of         \ncompensation elements) for each NEO.

A substantial majority (approximately\n96%) of the votes cast at the May 2021 annual \nmeeting of shareholders were in favor of our  \nannual \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In 2021, we     \ncontinued our engagement program, seeking     \nfeedback from shareholders and proxy advisory \nfirms on a variety of topics, including       \nexecutive compensation, corporate governance, \ndiversity and environmental and social goals. \nThe feedback that we received during the      \nengagement program was conveyed to the CMDS   \nCommittee and the Board. Shareholders who     \nprovided feedback during our engagement       \nprogram generally praised the quality of the  \nCompany\u2019s disclosure and reported that the    \nCommittee\u2019s use of discretion in the          \nadministration of the program is reasonable   \nand that executive compensation at Morgan     \nStanley is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. The CMDS Committee factored      \nshareholder feedback, including the \u201cSay on   \nPay\u201d vote results, into its consideration of  \nthe executive compensation structure and      \ndetermination of 2021 NEO pay levels. After   \ncarefully considering shareholder feedback and\nother factors, the CMDS Committee maintained  \nits performance-based approach to executive   \ncompensation for 2021 and increased the       \nproportion of incentive compensation granted  \nto the CEO in the form of performance-vested  \nlong-term stock unit awards from 50% to 60%.  \nIn addition, as discussed in Section 4.2, the \nCMDS Committee increased the MS Average ROTCE \nthreshold of the 2022\u20132024 performance-vested \nequity awards from 15% to 16% in order to earn\na maximum payout of 1.5 times this portion of \nthe award, reflecting the transformative      \nchanges to the business last year.            \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT61  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n2.

Framework for Making Compensation Decisions\n3.1 Factors Considered in Compensation        \nDecisions The 2021 compensation of the NEOs   \nwas determined by the CMDS Committee after    \nconsideration of Company business results,    \nstrategic performance and individual          \nperformance, as well as competitor            \ncompensation data and, with respect to the    \nCEO, benchmarking data, and other             \nconsiderations set forth below. PERFORMANCE   \nPRIORITIES For 2021, a number of quantitative \nand qualitative performance priorities were   \nset by the CMDS Committee and the Board at the\nbeginning of the year. The performance        \npriorities are established based on a         \ndirectional assessment made at the beginning  \nof the year in light of the market            \nenvironment, and the Company\u2019s strategic      \nobjectives and their attainment or non-       \nattainment does not correspond to any specific\ncompensation decision. To inform its decision-\nmaking process for NEO compensation for 2021, \nthe CMDS Committee evaluated Company and      \nindividual performance in light of the pre-   \nestablished performance priorities.

The Company uses \na Comparison Group to understand market       \npractices and trends, evaluate the            \ncompetitiveness of our compensation programs, \nand inform compensation decisions. Our        \nComparison Group consists of companies that   \neither directly compete with the Company for  \nbusiness and/or talent or are global          \norganizations with scope, size, or other      \ncharacteristics similar to those of the       \nCompany. BENCHMARKING TARGET CEO PAY As       \ndiscussed in Section 1.2, the CMDS Committee, \nin consultation with its independent          \ncompensation consultant, Pay Governance,      \nestablished a target range for 2021           \ncompensation for the CEO of $28 million or    \nmore for performance exceeding expectations to\n$10 million or less for performance           \nsubstantially below expectations. To inform   \nits decision-making with respect to the       \nappropriate target range, the CMDS Committee  \nreviewed available 2020 compensation levels   \nfor the 16 financial companies in the S&P 100 \nindex, which are intended to reflect          \ninstitutions of similar size, scope, and      \ncomplexity. The CMDS Committee then utilized  \nthe range of results as a benchmark from which\nto set the target range for 2021 compensation \nfor the CEO.                                  \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT63  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nRELATIVE PAY CONSIDERATIONS We place          \nimportance on the pay relationships among     \nmembers of our Operating Committee because we \nview our Operating Committee members as highly\ntalented executives capable of rotating among \nthe leadership positions of our businesses and\nkey functions. Our goal is always to be in a  \nposition to appoint our most senior executives\nfrom within our Company and to incentivize our\npeople to aspire to senior executive roles. At\nyear end, the CMDS Committee reviewed the     \nrelative differences between the compensation \nfor the CEO and other NEOs and between the    \nNEOs and other members of the Operating       \nCommittee. INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE \nCEO, INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AND INDEPENDENT   \nCONSULTANT At the end of the year, Mr. Gorman \npresented the CMDS Committee with performance \nassessments and compensation recommendations  \nfor each NEO, other than himself. The CMDS    \nCommittee reviewed these recommendations with \nits independent compensation consultant to    \nassess whether they were reasonable compared  \nwith the market for executive talent and met  \nin executive session to discuss the           \nperformance of our CEO and the other NEOs and \nto determine their compensation. In addition, \nthe CMDS Committee and Board reviewed proposed\nNEO incentive compensation with Mr. Gorman,   \nand the CMDS Committee reviewed CEO           \ncompensation with the Board (other than Mr.   \nGorman). COMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSIDERATIONS  \nPrior to determining individual NEO incentive \ncompensation, the CMDS Committee reviewed and \nconsidered the relationship between Company   \nperformance, total compensation expense (which\nincludes fixed compensation costs such as base\nsalaries, allowances, benefits, commissions   \nand amortization of prior deferred            \ncompensation awards), and incentive           \ncompensation as a subset of overall           \ncompensation expense. This exercise furthers  \nthe balancing of the objectives of delivering \nreturns for shareholders, while providing     \nappropriate rewards to motivate superior      \nindividual performance. GLOBAL REGULATORY     \nPRINCIPLES The Company\u2019s compensation         \npractices are subject to oversight by our     \nregulators in the U.S. and internationally.   \nFor example, the Company is subject to the    \nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s (Federal Reserve)     \nguidance that is designed to help ensure that \nincentive compensation paid by banking        \norganizations does not encourage imprudent    \nrisk-taking that threatens the organizations\u2019 \nsafety and soundness. The Company is also     \nsubject to the compensation-related provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the         \nremuneration code of the U.K. Financial       \nConduct Authority and the U.K. Prudential     \nRegulation Authority (U.K. PRA) Rulebook,     \nwhich prescribes the compensation structure   \nfor certain employees who are identified as   \nmaterial risk takers. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY       \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code   \n(Section 162(m)) limits the tax deductibility \nof compensation for certain executive officers\nthat is more than $1 million. The CMDS        \nCommittee continues to have the flexibility to\npay nondeductible compensation if it believes \nit is in the best interests of the Company.   \n                                         \n  64MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n3.2 Evaluating Company and Individual         \nPerformance for Alignment with Executive      \nCompensation As set forth in Section 1.3, in  \ndetermining the annual incentive compensation \nof the CEO and other NEOs, the CMDS Committee \nweighed the Company\u2019s overall financial       \nperformance and, as applicable, business unit \nperformance and achievement of its long-term  \nstrategic objectives. Management reviewed the \nCompany\u2019s forecasted 2021 financial           \nperformance with the CMDS Committee in        \nDecember 2021, and the CMDS Committee assessed\nfull-year actual financial results before     \nfinalizing compensation decisions in January  \n2022. COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND       \nSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES In 2021, Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nstrategic progress and financial performance  \nwere reflected in the Company\u2019s record        \nfinancial results. The CMDS Committee         \nconsidered these results, as well as the      \nperformance indicated below, in determining   \ncompensation for our NEOs.                    \n

In addition, as    \ndiscussed in Section 4.2, the CMDS Committee  \nincreased the MS Average ROTCE threshold of   \nthe 2022\u20132024 LTIP awards to earn a maximum   \npayout of 1.5 times this portion of the award,\nreflecting the transformative changes to the  \nbusiness last year.                           \n                                         \n  68MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nFor other NEOs, the amount of incentive       \ncompensation that is deferred is based on a   \ndeferral table, which results in a more       \nsignificant deferral at higher incentive      \ncompensation levels.

Each NEO   \nreceives a base salary and is eligible to     \nreceive discretionary annual incentive        \ncompensation for prior year performance.      \nAnnual incentive compensation is intended to  \nreward NEOs for achievement of the Company\u2019s  \nfinancial and strategic objectives over the   \nprior year and is delivered in a mix of a cash\nbonus and deferred incentive compensation in  \nthe form of deferred equity. The amount of    \nincentive compensation that is deferred is    \nbased on a deferral table, which provides for \na more significant deferral at higher         \nincentive compensation levels. For 2021, the  \nCommittee did not grant deferred cash-based   \nawards and instead granted RSUs, resulting in \n100% of each NEO\u2019s deferred incentive         \ncompensation being equity-based, further      \naligning compensation with shareholders\u2019      \ninterests. The LTIP awards, which are deferred\nequity awards that are subject to future      \nachievement of specified financial objectives \nover a three-year period, are described in    \nmore detail in

Program The 2022\u20132024 \nLTIP awards tie a meaningful portion of each  \nNEO\u2019s compensation to the Company\u2019s long-term \nfinancial performance and reinforce the NEO\u2019s \naccountability for the achievement of the     \nCompany\u2019s financial and strategic objectives  \nby directly linking the ultimate realizable   \naward value to prospective performance against\ncore financial measures over a three-year     \nperiod. GENERAL TERMS The 2022\u20132024 LTIP      \nawards will vest and convert to shares of the \nCompany\u2019s common stock at the end of the      \nthree-year performance period upon the        \nCompany\u2019s achievement of predetermined        \nperformance objectives with respect to ROTCE  \nand relative TSR, as set forth below, over the\nperiod beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending\non December 31, 2024. These performance       \nobjectives are consistent with, and drive,    \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s long-term strategy,          \nreflective in the strategic objectives in     \nSection 1.3 and the performance priorities in \nSection 3.1. While each participant was       \nawarded a target number of performance stock  \nunits, the actual number of units earned could\nvary from zero, if performance objectives are \nnot met, to up to 1.5 times target, if        \nperformance objectives are meaningfully       \nexceeded. No participant will receive any     \nportion of the LTIP award if the threshold    \nperformance objectives are not met.           \n                                         \n  70MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThe LTIP awards remain subject to cancellation\nupon certain events until they are converted  \nto shares of Company common stock. If, after  \nconversion of the LTIP awards, the CMDS       \nCommittee determines that the performance     \ncertified by the CMDS Committee was based on  \nmaterially inaccurate financial statements,   \nthen the shares delivered will be subject to  \nclawback by the Company. PERFORMANCE          \nOBJECTIVES One-half of the target LTIP award  \nis earned based on the Company\u2019s average ROTCE\nover the three-year performance period (MS    \nAverage ROTCE). The other half of the target  \nLTIP award is earned based on the Company\u2019s   \nTSR over the three-year period (MS TSR)       \nrelative to the TSR of the S&P 500 Financials \nIndex over the same three-year period (Index  \nGroup TSR). The number of stock units         \nultimately earned will be determined by       \nmultiplying each half of the target award by a\nmultiplier as follows (for performance between\ntwo thresholds, straight-line interpolation   \napplies):                                     \n                                     \n  MS Average ROTCE*      Multiplier  \n  16% or more                  1.50  \n  13%                          1.00  \n  8%                           0.50  \n  Less than 8%                 0.00  \n                                     \n                                  \n  Relative TSR**      Multiplier  \n  25% or more               1.50  \n  0%                        1.00  \n  -50%                      0.50  \n  Less than -50%            0.00  \n                                  \n                                              \n     MS Average ROTCE, for this purpose,      \n     excludes: (a) the impact of debt         \n     valuation adjustment; (b) certain gains  \n     or losses associated with the sale of    \n     specified businesses; (c) certain gains  \n     or losses associated with specified      \n     legal settlements relating to business   \n     activities conducted prior to January\u00a0   \n     1, 2011; and (d) specified cumulative    \n     catch-up adjustments resulting from      \n     changes in, or application of, a new     \n     accounting rule that are not applied on  \n  *  a full retrospective basis.              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Relative TSR is determined by           \n      subtracting the Index Group TSR from    \n  **  the MS TSR; however, if performance     \n      for the period is negative, the         \n      multiplier may not exceed 1.00.         \n                                              \nThe CMDS Committee increased the MS Average   \nROTCE threshold of the 2022\u20132024 LTIP awards  \nfrom 15% to 16% in order to earn a maximum    \npayout of 1.5 times this portion of the award,\nreflecting the transformative changes to the  \nbusiness last year. As described in further   \ndetail in note 2 to the \u201c2021 Grants of Plan- \nBased Awards\u201d table, each of our NEOs, except \nfor Ms. Yeshaya, received an LTIP award in    \n2021 on similar terms as described above.     \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT71  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThe CMDS Committee has consistently set       \nchallenging performance objectives for our    \nLTIP awards. The variability over time of the \npercentage of our LTIP awards that have been  \nearned demonstrates a strong pay-for-         \nperformance link. Since the inception of the  \nprogram in 2009, the average of the payouts of\nall ten LTIP awards up to and including the   \n2019 LTIP awards is 103% of target. LTIP      \nPROGRAM PERFORMANCE As described in note 3 to \nthe \u201c2021 Stock Vested\u201d table, LTIP awards    \ngranted in 2019 (2019 LTIP award) vested at   \n150% of target, based on performance over the \nthree-year performance period ended December  \n31, 2021. 4.4 Additional Compensation         \nPractices ROBUST CLAWBACK POLICIES AND        \nPROCEDURES Throughout the year, employee      \nconduct matters are reviewed to determine     \nwhether they present situations that could    \nrequire clawback or cancellation of previously\nawarded compensation, as well as downward     \nadjustments to current-year compensation.     \nClawbacks of previously awarded compensation  \nare reviewed with the Employee Discipline     \nOversight Committee (a committee of senior    \nmanagement currently composed of the Chief    \nOperating Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief \nRisk Officer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Human\nResources Officer and Chief Compliance        \nOfficer) (the \u201cEDOC\u201d) and reported to the CMDS\nCommittee. In addition, the Global Incentive  \nCompensation Discretion Policy adopted by the \nCMDS Committee sets forth standards for       \nmanagers on the use of discretion when making \nannual compensation decisions and             \nconsiderations for assessing risk management  \nand outcomes. Further, the Company\u2019s control  \nfunctions conduct a semiannual review of      \nemployee conduct with respect to risk and     \ncontrol matters, and are asked to identify    \ninappropriate behavior that may not be        \ncaptured through other Company processes. The \nresults of the reviews are reported to the    \nEDOC and are reflected in performance feedback\nand considered in promotion and compensation  \ndecisions. NO CHANGE IN CONTROL TAX GROSS-UP  \nPROTECTION NEOs are not contractually entitled\nto any golden parachute excise tax protection \nupon a change in control of Morgan Stanley and\nare not entitled to severance pay upon        \ntermination of employment in excess of broad- \nbased benefits. HEALTH AND INSURANCE BENEFITS \nAll NEOs are eligible to participate in       \nCompany-sponsored health and insurance benefit\nprograms available in the relevant            \njurisdiction to similarly situated employees. \nIn the U.S., higher compensated employees pay \nmore to participate in the Company\u2019s medical  \nplan.

The Company\u2019s Board-approved\npolicy authorizes the CEO to use the Company\u2019s\naircraft. As of January 1, 2010, Mr. Gorman   \nentered into a time-share agreement with the  \nCompany permitting him to reimburse the       \nCompany for the incremental cost of his       \npersonal use of the Company\u2019s aircraft. In    \n2021, for health and safety reasons, NEOs were\nauthorized to use the Company\u2019s aircraft and  \ncertain NEOs entered into time-share          \nagreements with the Company permitting them to\nreimburse the Company in part for their       \npersonal use of the Company\u2019s aircraft.       \nBeginning in 2022, the CEO will again         \nreimburse the Company for the incremental cost\nof his personal use of the Company\u2019s aircraft \nand other NEOs are generally not authorized to\nuse the Company\u2019s aircraft for personal       \nreasons unless they receive prior permission  \nfrom both the CEO and the Chief Legal Officer \nand reimburse the Company for the incremental \ncost of their personal use of the Company\u2019s   \naircraft.

The Company strives to maximize \nemployee and shareholder alignment through the\nuse of deferred equity awards, while          \nminimizing dilution. The Company\u2019s share      \nrepurchase program offsets the dilutive impact\nof these additional shares.                   \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT73  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n5.

No NEO had          \n       above-market earnings on nonqualified  \n       deferred compensation awards in 2021.  \n       The 2021 Change in Pension Value       \n       equals the aggregate change from       \n       December\u00a031, 2020 to December\u00a031,      \n       2021 in the actuarially determined     \n       present values of the accumulated      \n       benefits under the Company-sponsored   \n       defined benefit pension plans during   \n       the measurement period. These present  \n       values generally decreased during      \n       2021, mainly due to the increase in    \n       discount rates noted below, partially  \n       offset by other factors. The present   \n       values at December\u00a031, 2021 use 91%    \n       of the Pri-2012 white collar           \n  (6)  mortality tables (amounts-weighted),   \n       with no mortality before retirement.   \n       These tables are projected             \n       generationally from 2012, using the    \n       standard version of Scale MP-2021.     \n       The present values reflect discount    \n       rates of 3.02% for the Morgan Stanley  \n       Employees Retirement Plan (ERP). The   \n       present values at December\u00a031, 2020    \n       used the Pri-2012 white collar         \n       mortality tables (amounts-weighted),   \n       with no mortality before retirement.   \n       These tables were projected            \n       generationally from 2012, using the    \n       standard version of Scale MP-2020.     \n       The present values reflect discount    \n       rates of 2.71% for the ERP. Benefits   \n       are assumed to commence at the         \n       earliest age that the NEO can receive  \n       unreduced benefits (or current age,    \n       if later).                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       The \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column    \n       for 2021 includes (a) contributions    \n       made by the Company under our defined  \n       contribution plans with respect to     \n       such period and (b) the incremental    \n       cost to the Company of perquisites     \n       and other personal benefits, as        \n  (7)  detailed below.

Also includes the  \n       variable costs associated with use of  \n       the Company\u2019s aircraft, less amounts   \n       reimbursed by the NEO for such         \n       flights. For health and safety         \n       reasons, in 2021, NEOs were            \n       authorized to use the Company\u2019s        \n       aircraft for personal purposes and     \n       the NEOs reimbursed the Company for a  \n       portion of the costs associated with   \n       such use.

Effective after December 31, 2010, the  \nERP was frozen and no further benefit accruals\nwill occur. Benefits are generally payable as \nan annuity at age 65 (or earlier, subject to  \ncertain reductions in the amounts payable).   \nUnder the pre-2004 provisions of the ERP,     \nbenefits are payable in full at age 60 and    \nreduced 4% per year for retirement between    \nages 55 and 60 for employees who retire after \nage 55 with 10 years of service. Before the   \nERP was frozen, annual benefits were equal to \n1% of eligible earnings plus 0.5% of eligible \nearnings in excess of Social Security covered \ncompensation for each year of service.        \nEligible earnings generally included all      \ntaxable compensation, other than certain      \nequity-based and non-recurring amounts, up to \n$170,000 per year. ERP participants who, as of\nJanuary 1, 2004, had age plus service equal to\nat least 65 and who had been credited with    \nfive years of service, received benefits      \ndetermined under the ERP\u2019s pre-2004 benefit   \nformula, if greater. Pre-2004 benefits equaled\n1.15% of final average salary, plus 0.35% of  \nfinal average salary in excess of Social      \nSecurity covered compensation, in each case   \nmultiplied by credited service up to 35 years,\nwhere final average salary was base salary, up\nto specified limits set forth in the ERP, for \nthe highest paid 60 consecutive months of the \nlast 120 months of service. 2021 Nonqualified \nDeferred Compensation The following table     \ncontains information with respect to the      \nparticipation of the NEOs in the Company\u2019s    \nunfunded cash deferred compensation plans that\nprovide for the deferral of compensation on a \nbasis that is not tax-qualified, as well as   \nwith respect to RSUs granted to the NEOs that \nare vested but have not yet converted to      \nshares of Morgan Stanley common stock.

MORGAN STANLEY COMPENSATION  \nINCENTIVE PLAN (MSCIP) Prior to 2020 year end,\na portion of a participant\u2019s year-end deferred\nincentive compensation may be granted under   \nMSCIP. Earnings on MSCIP awards are based on  \nthe performance of notional investments       \navailable under the plan and selected by the  \nparticipants. Participants may reallocate such\nbalances periodically, as determined by the   \nplan administrator. Until MSCIP awards reach  \ntheir scheduled distribution date, they are   \nsubject to cancellation and clawback by the   \nCompany. The cancellation and clawback events \napplicable to MSCIP awards held by our NEOs   \nare described in the CD&A and in \u201cPotential   \nPayments upon Termination or Change in        \nControl.\u201d PRE-TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM (PTIP)    \nUnder PTIP, participants were permitted to    \ndefer a portion of their cash bonus or        \ncommissions for one or more fiscal years. The \nplan has been closed to new contributions     \nsince 2003. Earnings on PTIP contributions are\nbased on the performance of notional          \ninvestments available under the plan and      \nselected by the participants. Participants    \ncould generally elect the commencement date   \nfor distributions of their contributions and  \nearnings and the number of annual installments\nover which to receive distributions           \n(generally, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years). Subject to\nearlier distribution on death or termination  \nof employment due to disability, no           \ndistributions may begin prior to the          \nattainment of age 55, and no distribution may \nbegin prior to termination of employment.     \nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUs) RSUs are granted\nunder the Morgan Stanley Equity Incentive     \nCompensation Plan or another Company equity   \nplan as determined by the CMDS Committee. Each\nRSU constitutes a contingent and unsecured    \npromise of the Company to pay the holder one  \nshare of Company common stock on the          \nconversion date of the RSU. The RSUs included \nin this table are considered vested; however, \nthe RSUs are subject to cancellation and      \nclawback if a cancellation or clawback event  \noccurs at any time prior to the scheduled     \nconversion date. The cancellation and clawback\nevents applicable to RSUs held by our NEOs are\ndescribed in the CD&A and in \u201cPotential       \nPayments upon Termination or Change in        \nControl.\u201d Potential Payments upon Termination \nor Change in Control This section describes   \nand quantifies the benefits and compensation  \nto which each NEO would have been entitled    \nunder our existing plans and arrangements if  \nthe NEO\u2019s employment had terminated or if the \nCompany had undergone a change in control, in \neach case on December 31, 2021. 1. General    \nPolicies NO SPECIAL SEVERANCE PAYMENTS Our    \nNEOs would be entitled to a cash severance    \npayment under the broad-based Morgan Stanley  \nSeverance Pay Plan (Severance Plan) in        \nconnection with an involuntary termination of \nemployment other than for cause, on the same  \nbasis as all other employees, and subject to  \nthe NEO executing a release agreement in a    \nform satisfactory to the Company. The NEOs are\nnot entitled to any additional or enhanced    \ncash severance payments upon any termination  \nof employment under the Severance Plan or     \notherwise, or to excise tax protection upon a \nchange in control of the Company.             \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT83  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nNO ENHANCED TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR BENEFITS  \nNEOs are entitled to receive post-termination \nbenefits that are generally available to all  \nsalaried employees, such as death, disability \nand post-retirement welfare benefits, and are \neligible for Company-paid retiree medical     \ncoverage under the Morgan Stanley             \nGrandfathered Retiree Medical Plan for        \nthemselves and eligible dependents following  \nany termination of employment with three years\nof service. Following termination of          \nemployment, the NEOs are also entitled to     \namounts, to the extent vested, due under the  \nterms of our pension arrangements, as         \ndescribed under \u201c2021 Pension Benefits,\u201d and  \nour nonqualified deferred compensation plans, \nas described under \u201c2021 Nonqualified Deferred\nCompensation.\u201d Our NEOs are not entitled to   \nspecial or enhanced termination benefits under\nour pension and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation plans as compared to other       \nemployees. CANCELLATION AND CLAWBACK OF       \nDEFERRED COMPENSATION Even if an NEO is       \nconsidered vested in a deferred incentive     \ncompensation award, the award may be subject  \nto cancellation through the distribution date \nin the event the NEO engages in a cancellation\nevent or if a clawback event occurs. In       \ngeneral, a cancellation event includes:       \nengaging in competitive activity during a     \nspecified period following a voluntary        \ntermination of employment; engaging in cause  \n(i.e., a breach of the NEO\u2019s obligation to the\nCompany, including a failure to comply with   \ninternal compliance, ethics or risk management\nstandards and failure or refusal to perform   \nduties satisfactorily, including supervisory  \nand management duties); improper disclosure of\nthe Company\u2019s proprietary information;        \nsolicitation of Company employees, clients or \ncustomers during, and within a specified      \nperiod following termination of, employment;  \nthe making of unauthorized disclosures or     \ndisparaging or defamatory comments about the  \nCompany; resignation from employment without  \nproviding the Company proper advance notice;  \nor the failure to cooperate with or assist the\nCompany in connection with investigations,    \nregulatory matters, lawsuits or arbitrations  \nfollowing termination of employment. Clawback \nof deferred compensation awards by the Company\ncan be triggered through the applicable       \nscheduled distribution date if the NEO had    \nsignificant responsibility for a material     \nadverse outcome for the Company or any of its \nbusinesses or functions, even absent          \nmisconduct, or if the NEO\u2019s act or omission   \n(including with respect to direct supervisory \nresponsibilities) causes a restatement of the \nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial results,     \nviolates the Company\u2019s global risk management \nprinciples, policies and standards, or causes \na loss of revenue associated with a position  \non which the NEO was paid and the NEO operated\noutside of internal control policies.

Amounts payable   \n       with respect to a termination in       \n       connection with a change in control    \n       are conditioned upon the termination   \n       occurring within 18 months of the      \n       change in control as a result of (i)\u00a0  \n       the Company terminating the NEO\u2019s      \n       employment under circumstances not     \n  (1)  involving any cancellation event,      \n       (ii)\u00a0the NEO resigning from            \n       employment due to a materially         \n       adverse alteration in job              \n       responsibilities, or (iii)\u00a0a change    \n       in the NEO\u2019s principal place of        \n       employment of more than 75 miles from  \n       the current location.

Amounts shown in   \n       the table reflect performance through  \n       December\u00a031, 2021 (the quarter ending  \n       simultaneously with the effective      \n       date of the termination), which, with  \n       the exception of a termination in      \n       connection with a change in control,   \n       is a substitute for performance        \n       through the three-year performance     \n       period, which would not be known       \n       until the end of such period.

The present value is           \n       calculated assuming each NEO began     \n       retiree medical, dental and vision     \n       coverage on December\u00a031, 2021 and      \n       elected their current dependent        \n       coverage type.

Because SEC rules\nfor identifying the median compensated        \nemployee for purposes of this disclosure allow\ncompanies to adopt various methodologies and  \nutilize various assumptions, the ratio        \nreported by other companies may not be        \ncomparable to the ratio reported by the       \nCompany.                                      \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT85  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nFor 2021, our last completed fiscal year, the \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nemployees of the Company (other than the CEO) \nwas $137,069 and the annual total compensation\nof our CEO, as reported in the \u201c2021 Summary  \nCompensation Table,\u201d was $34,941,635. Based on\nthis information, for 2021, the ratio of the  \nannual total compensation of the CEO to the   \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nother employees of the Company was 255 to 1.  \nTo identify the median of the annual total    \ncompensation of all employees of the Company, \nwe took the following steps:                  \n                                              \n      The pay ratio rule gives companies the  \n      ability to make the median employee     \n      determination only once every three     \n  1.  years, and we did not make a new        \n      median employee determination for       \n      2021. The median employee               \n      determination for 2020 is described     \n      below.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     We measured the employee population of   \n     the Company as of December\u00a031, 2020 and  \n     included all employees of Morgan         \n     Stanley and its consolidated             \n     subsidiaries globally. We did not        \n     include independent contractors and      \n     leased employees. Although our employee  \n     population varies slightly from the      \n     employee population in our December\u00a031,  \n     2020 determination, there have not been  \n     any changes that we reasonably believe   \n     would significantly impact our pay       \n  \u2022  ratio disclosure.                        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     We selected annual total reward awarded  \n     in respect of 2020 as the consistently   \n     applied compensation measure used to     \n     identify the employee with the median    \n     of the annual total compensation of all  \n     employees (the \u201cmedian employee\u201d).       \n     Annual total reward consists of fixed    \n     compensation (e.g., base salary and      \n     allowances) and annual incentive         \n     compensation delivered in cash or        \n     equity and other variable compensation   \n     analogous to annual incentive            \n     compensation (e.g., commissions). We     \n     annualized the compensation of all       \n  \u2022  permanent employees who were employed    \n     for less than the full fiscal year. We   \n     did not make any cost-of-living          \n     adjustments in identifying the median    \n     employee. Our median employee for 2020   \n     served in a similar role in 2021 and     \n     had his or her compensation adjusted     \n     based on his or her performance in that  \n     role. We determined that changes in our  \n     median employee\u2019s compensation           \n     arrangements for 2021 did not result in  \n     a significant change to our pay ratio    \n     disclosure and, therefore, that it was   \n     reasonable to utilize our median         \n     employee for our pay ratio disclosure    \n     for 2021.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      Once we identified that our median      \n      employee selected in 2020 was still     \n      reasonable for 2021 disclosure, we      \n  2.  calculated the median employee\u2019s        \n      annual total compensation for 2021 in   \n      accordance with the Summary             \n      Compensation Table requirements.        \n                                              \nCommitment to Equitable Compensation Practices\nAttracting, retaining and advancing under-    \nrepresented talent is a priority for the      \nCompany, and a key aspect to this is ensuring \nthat women and all other under-represented    \ngroups are rewarded equitably. Morgan Stanley \nhas robust compensation practices that help   \nensure that compensation and reward decisions \nare made fairly and consistently and are based\non an individual\u2019s role, performance and      \nexperience. The Company reviews compensation  \ndecisions for employees on an ongoing basis,  \nincluding at the point of hire as well as     \nduring our annual compensation process, to    \nhelp ensure that individual compensation      \ndecisions are in line with this philosophy. A \ndiverse workforce is key to our success, and  \nconsistent with that, we are committed to     \ncontinually assessing our rewards structure   \nand decisions to help ensure equity in pay for\nall employees.                                \n                                         \n  86MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOwnership of Our Stock Executive Equity       \nOwnership Commitment Members of the Company\u2019s \nOperating Committee are subject to an Equity  \nOwnership Commitment. The Equity Ownership    \nCommitment requires each of our CEO, CFO and  \nCo-Presidents (collectively, Covered Officers)\nto achieve ownership of a number of shares of \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to a specified multiple of his base     \nsalary within five years. Our CEO is required \nto achieve ownership of shares of common stock\nand equity awards with a value equal to 10    \ntimes his base salary and each other Covered  \nOfficer is required to achieve ownership of   \nshares of common stock and equity awards with \na value equal to six times his or her base    \nsalary. In addition, Operating Committee      \nmembers (including all executive officers) are\nrequired to hold common stock and equity      \nawards equal to a percentage of common stock  \nreceived from equity awards (less allowances  \nfor the payment of any option exercise price  \nand taxes) granted to them for service on the \nOperating Committee (Equity Award Shares) as  \nfollows:                                      \n                                              \n  \u2022  Our CEO is required to retain 75% of     \n     Equity Award Shares.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each of our other Operating Committee    \n     members is required to retain 50% of     \n     Equity Award Shares acquired from        \n     equity awards granted beginning in       \n     January 2016 and thereafter, and 75% of  \n  \u2022  Equity Award Shares acquired from        \n     equity awards granted prior to January   \n     2016; provided that Operating Committee  \n     members who are Covered Officers must    \n     retain 75% of all Equity Award Shares    \n     until the applicable ownership           \n     requirement is met.                      \n                                              \nThis commitment ties a portion of our         \nOperating Committee members\u2019 net worth to the \nCompany\u2019s stock price and provides a          \ncontinuing incentive for them to work toward  \nsuperior long-term stock price performance.   \nExceptions to the Equity Ownership Commitment \nare subject to the approval of the CMDS       \nCommittee. None of our executive officers     \ncurrently have prearranged trading plans under\nSEC Rule 10b5-1. Director Equity Ownership    \nRequirement Our Corporate Governance Policies \nrequire each independent director to retain   \nownership of a number of shares of Morgan     \nStanley common stock and equity awards with a \nvalue equal to five times the annual cash     \nBoard retainer, and to retain 100% of his or  \nher Morgan Stanley stock unit awards (on an   \nafter-tax basis) until such ownership         \nrequirement is met. In addition, as discussed \nunder \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d our independent\ndirectors generally receive an equity award   \nupon initial election to the Board and receive\nan annual equity award thereafter with a grant\ndate fair value of $250,000 (prorated in the  \ncase of the initial award) as part of their   \ndirector compensation. Fifty percent of each  \nequity award granted to our independent       \ndirectors does not become payable until the   \ndirector retires from the Board (and may be   \ndeferred beyond retirement at the director\u2019s  \nelection). We believe these equity ownership  \nopportunities and requirements enhance the    \nalignment of independent directors\u2019 interests \nwith the long-term interests of our           \nshareholders. Prohibition Against Pledging and\nHedging Company policy prohibits directors,   \nofficers as defined by Section 16 of the      \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, including the\nCompany\u2019s executive officers, and other       \nmembers of the Company\u2019s Operating Committee  \nfrom pledging, selling short, engaging in     \nhedging strategies or trading derivatives     \ninvolving Morgan Stanley securities, including\nsecurities granted in connection with         \ncompensation or otherwise held. Company policy\npermits other employees to transact in covered\ncalls and protective puts with respect to     \ncurrently owned and saleable Morgan Stanley   \nshares, subject to varying holding and window \nperiod requirements. No employee may hedge or \npledge the value of outstanding restricted    \nstock units, performance stock units or other \nequity-based compensation awards.             \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT87  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Ownership of Our Stock  \n                          \nStock Ownership of Executive Officers and     \nDirectors The following table sets forth the  \nbeneficial ownership of common stock as of    \nFebruary 28, 2022 by our CEO and the other    \nexecutive officers named in the \u201c2021 Summary \nCompensation Table\u201d (our NEOs), directors, the\ndirector nominee and by all of our directors  \nand executive officers as a group.

As        \n     discussed above, despite Morgan          \n     Stanley\u2019s existing public commitments    \n     to transition to a low-carbon economy,   \n     the proposal seeks to impose specific    \n     measures and dictate a prescribed        \n  \u00b0  method to achieve such policy that       \n     limits Morgan Stanley\u2019s discretion.      \n     Implementation of the proposal could     \n     require Morgan Stanley to take measures  \n     to avoid new financings, and cease all   \n     forms of ongoing financings, to our      \n     clients that are involved in, or         \n     otherwise indirectly contribute to,      \n     fossil fuel development.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Lending and underwriting form a          \n     significant part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s     \n     Institutional Securities core business.  \n     Consequently, decisions around the       \n     provision of financial services,         \n  \u00b0  including the extension of credit, to    \n     our clients are fundamental to           \n     management\u2019s ability to run our          \n     business in a manner that is in the      \n     best interest of Morgan Stanley and our  \n     stakeholders.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     The proposal\u2019s \u201cone size fit all\u201d        \n     approach to the complicated objective    \n     of reducing carbon emissions does not    \n     leave room for Morgan Stanley            \n  \u00b0  management to weigh the complex          \n     variables, and manage associated risks,  \n     that are needed in deciding whether to   \n     enter into new businesses or manage our  \n     existing obligations.

For instance, the proposal relies on \nthe assumption that demand for fossil fuel    \nproduction will decline quickly and steadily; \nhowever this may not be the case.             \n                                              \n     From a risk perspective, we have been    \n     intensely focused on integrating         \n     climate risk considerations into our     \n     risk management processes. We believe    \n  \u00b0  our Net-Zero commitment and our interim  \n     targets discussed above will help        \n     reduce our exposure to transition risk   \n     from the most emissions-intensive        \n     companies over time.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     We expect to reduce our transition risk  \n     through sound client engagement and      \n     risk management processes that support   \n  \u2022  our clients\u2019 transition to more          \n     sustainable, lower-carbon business       \n     models that may be less vulnerable to    \n     changes in policy, technology and        \n     consumer sentiments.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     We are best positioned to work toward    \n  \u2022  these objectives with continued          \n     discretion to maintain our business      \n     relationships with our clients.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     While we have utilized the most          \n     relevant part of IEA Program Finance     \n     Initiative to guide our financed         \n     emissions pathway, we did not commit to  \n  \u00b0  completely instituting every aspect of   \n     the initiative as it is critical that    \n     we adapt the initiative to what is best  \n     for Morgan Stanley and our               \n     stakeholders.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     While this framework calls for an        \n     immediate end to fossil fuel expansion,  \n  \u2022  we believe that there must be a          \n     balancing of the potential impacts on    \n     Morgan Stanley, the economy and on       \n     society.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     At this time, we believe immediately     \n     removing support from key sectors like   \n     energy (or even providing in a policy    \n  \u2022  for removal of support by a future       \n     date) would also likely undermine a      \n     smooth climate transition and the role   \n     that Morgan Stanley can play.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     For the foregoing reasons, the Board     \n     believes the policy requested by the     \n     proposal is unnecessary in light of our  \n     Net-Zero commitment, interim financed    \n  \u2022  emissions targets and other public       \n     commitments; robust risk management      \n     programs and policies; and ability to    \n     assist clients in their transition to a  \n     low-carbon economy.                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Board also believes management       \n     should have the ability to weigh the     \n     complex variables that are needed in     \n     the course of Morgan Stanley\u2019s business  \n  \u2022  and have the flexibility to decide the   \n     best way for Morgan Stanley to           \n     contribute to a low-carbon economy in a  \n     manner that is in the best interests of  \n     Morgan Stanley, our clients and our      \n     stakeholders.                            \n                                              \nOur Board unanimously recommends that you vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201dthis proposal.

Voting of the shares   \nheld in the 401(k) Plan also is confidential. \nHow Do I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares\nHeld Through a Broker? If you hold shares     \nthrough a broker, follow the voting           \ninstructions you receive from your broker. If \nyou do not submit voting instructions to your \nbroker, your broker may still be permitted to \nvote your shares in certain cases. NYSE member\nbrokers may vote your shares as described     \nbelow:                                        \n                                              \n     Non-discretionary Items.All items,       \n     other than the ratification of the       \n     appointment of Morgan Stanley\u2019s          \n     independent auditor, are                 \n     \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d items. It is         \n  \u2022  critically important that you submit     \n     your voting instructions if you want     \n     your shares to count for                 \n     non-discretionary items.Your shares      \n     will remain unvoted for such items if    \n     your NYSE member broker does not         \n     receive voting instructions from you.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Discretionary Item.The ratification of   \n     the appointment of Morgan Stanley\u2019s      \n     independent auditor is a                 \n  \u2022  \u201cdiscretionary\u201d item.

This results in a    \n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d for non-discretionary items.\nHow Do I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares\nHeld in My Name? If you hold shares as a      \nrecord shareholder, you may have your shares  \nvoted by submitting a proxy for your shares by\nmail, telephone or the Internet as described  \non the proxy card. If you submit your proxy   \nvia the Internet, you may incur Internet      \naccess charges. Submitting your proxy will not\nlimit your right to vote at the annual        \nmeeting. A properly completed and submitted   \nproxy will be voted in accordance with your   \ninstructions, unless you subsequently revoke  \nyour proxy in accordance with the procedures  \ndescribed below (see \u201cHow Can I Revoke My     \nProxy?\u201d). If you submit a signed proxy card   \nwithout indicating your voting instructions,  \nthe person voting the proxy will vote your    \nshares according to the Board\u2019s               \nrecommendations. How Do I Submit Voting       \nInstructions for Shares Held in Employee      \nPlans? If you hold shares in, or have been    \nawarded stock units under, certain employee   \nplans, you will separately receive directions \non how to submit your voting instructions.    \nShares held in the following employee plans   \nalso are subject to the following rules:      \n401(k) Plan. The Northern Trust Company       \n(Northern Trust), the 401(k) Plan\u2019s trustee,  \nmust receive your voting instructions for the \ncommon stock held on your behalf in the 401(k)\nPlan on or before May 23, 2022. If Northern   \nTrust does not receive your voting            \ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares together with other unvoted, forfeited \nand unallocated shares in the 401(k) Plan in  \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives from other participants in   \nthe 401(k) Plan. On March 28, 2022, there were\n29,341,044 shares in the 401(k) Plan. Other   \nEquity-Based Plans. State Street Global       \nAdvisors Trust Company acts as trustee for the\nTrust that holds shares of common stock       \nunderlying stock units awarded to employees   \nunder several of Morgan Stanley\u2019s equity-based\nplans. Employees allocated shares held in the \nTrust must submit their voting instructions   \nfor receipt by the trustee on or before May   \n23, 2022. If the trustee does not receive your\ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares, together with shares held in the Trust\nthat are unallocated or held on behalf of     \nformer Morgan Stanley employees and employees \nin certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., in \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives for shares held in the Trust \nin connection with such plans. On March 28,   \n2022, 65,834,084 shares were held in the Trust\nin connection with such plans. How Can I      \nRevoke My Proxy? You can revoke your proxy at \nany time before your shares are voted by (1)  \ndelivering a written revocation notice prior  \nto the annual meeting to Martin M. Cohen,     \nCorporate Secretary, Morgan Stanley, 1585     \nBroadway, Suite C, New York, New York 10036;  \n(2) submitting a later dated proxy that we    \nreceive no later than when the polls close    \nduring the annual meeting; or (3) voting at   \nthe annual meeting. Attending the annual      \nmeeting does not revoke your proxy unless you \nvote at the meeting. Why Did I Receive a One- \nPage Notice Regarding the Internet            \nAvailability of Proxy Materials? Pursuant to  \nSEC rules, we are mailing to certain of our   \nshareholders a Notice about the availability  \nof proxy materials on the Internet instead of \npaper copies of the proxy materials. This     \nprocess allows us to expedite our             \nshareholders\u2019 receipt of proxy materials,     \nlower the costs of distribution and reduce the\nenvironmental impact of our annual meeting.   \nAll shareholders receiving the Notice will    \nhave the ability to access the proxy materials\nand submit a proxy over the Internet. It is   \nimportant that you submit your proxy to have  \nyour shares voted.                            \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2022 PROXY STATEMENT97  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                        \n  Information About the Annual Meeting  \n                                        \nInstructions on how to access the proxy       \nmaterials over the Internet or to request a   \npaper copy of the proxy materials may be found\nin the Notice.
