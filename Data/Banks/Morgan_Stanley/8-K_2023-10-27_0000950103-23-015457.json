The Committee\ngranted the Awards in acknowledgment of the\nBoard\u2019s assessment of the criticality to the\ncontinued success of Morgan Stanley of\nensuring that each executive continues their\noutstanding leadership in their new roles at\nthe Company.\n\nThe Awards are equity-based, and are designed\nto reinforce the executive\u2019s accountability\nfor the Company\u2019s future financial goals and\ndirectly tie compensation\noutcomes to shareholder-based value creation\nover a multi-year period in a balanced manner\nthat does not encourage imprudent risk taking,\nwhile incentivizing leadership continuity.\nEach Award consists of 60% performance stock\nunits (\u201cPSUs\u201d) with a performance\nperiod of 2024-2026 that convert to shares in\n2027 and 40% restricted-stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d)\nthat vest and convert to shares\non January 25, 2027. Given a recent review of\nthe Company\u2019s PSU program in 2022 with the\nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant and the Company\u2019s Chief Risk\nOfficer and resulting updates to the program,\nthe Committee determined that the program\u2019s\nequal weighting of absolute and relative ROTCE\nperformance metrics, three-year performance\nperiod and performance grid were appropriate\nfor the PSU portion of the Award in order to\nmaintain alignment with the Company\u2019s\nfinancial and strategic objectives. The Awards\ndo not contain a provision for vesting upon\nachieving retirement eligibility, are subject\nto cancellation for resignation or competitive\nactivity, and are subject to the Company\u2019s\naccounting restatement clawback policy and\nEquity Ownership Commitment.Each Award\nhas a grant date fair value of $20 million,\nwhich is approximately the average of the\nannual variable compensation of the three\nexecutives.\nThe aggregate number of PSUs and RSUs granted\nwas determined by dividing the Award grant\nvalue by the volume-weighted average price of\nthe Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date.\nThese Awards are not part of the executives\u2019\nregular annual compensation and will not be\nawarded on a regular basis.\n\nThe above summary of the Awards is qualified\nin its entirety by reference to the applicable\naward certificate (forms of which are attached\nasExhibit 10.33 to the Company\u2019s annual report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2017 and Exhibit 10.22 to theCompany\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022).\n\nThe Company\u2019s related press release\nis attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current\nReport on Form 8-K and is incorporated by\nreference in its entirety.\n                                              \n  Item 9.01.
