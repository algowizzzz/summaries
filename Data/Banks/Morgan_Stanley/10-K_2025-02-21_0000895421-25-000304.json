We compete in the\nU.S. and globally for\nclients, market share\nand human talent.\nOperating within the\nfinancial services\nindustry on a global\nbasis presents, among\nother things,\ntechnological, risk\nmanagement,\nregulatory,\ninfrastructure and\nother challenges that\nrequire effective\nresource allocation in\norder for us to remain\ncompetitive. Our\ncompetitive position\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including our\nreputation, client\nexperience, the\nquality and\nconsistency of our\nlong-term investment\nperformance,\ninnovation, execution,\nrelative pricing and\nother factors,\nincluding entering\ninto new or expanding\ncurrent businesses as\na result of\nacquisitions and other\nstrategic initiatives.\nOur ability to sustain\nor improve our\ncompetitive\n\nposition also depends\nsubstantially on our\nability to continue to\nattract and retain\nhighly qualified\nemployees while\nmanaging compensation\nand other costs. We\ncompete with\ncommercial banks,\nglobal investment\nbanks, regional banks,\nbroker-dealers,\nprivate banks,\nregistered investment\nadvisers, digital\ninvesting platforms,\ntraditional and\nalternative asset\nmanagers, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial and\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally.\nIn addition,\nrestrictive laws and\nregulations applicable\nto certain global\nfinancial services\ninstitutions, which\nhave been increasing\nin complexity and\nvolume, may prohibit\nus from engaging in\ncertain transactions,\nimpose more stringent\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements, and\nincrease costs, and\ncan put us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage to\ncompetitors in certain\nbusinesses not subject\nto these same\nrequirements. See also\n\u201cSupervision and\nRegulation\u201d herein and\n\u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\nThere is increased\ncompetition in the\nU.S. and globally\ndriven by established\nfinancial services\nfirms and emerging\nfirms, including non-\nfinancial companies\nand business models\nfocusing on technology\ninnovation, competing\nfor the same clients\nand assets, or\noffering similar\nproducts and service s\nto retail and\ninstitutional\ncustomers. It is also\npossible that\ncompetition may become\neven more intense as\nwe continue to compete\nwith financial or\nother institutions\nthat may be, or may\nbecome, larger, or\nbetter capitalized, or\nmay have a stronger\nlocal presence and\nlonger operating\nhistory in certain\ngeographies or\nproducts. Many of\nthese firms have the\nability to offer a\nwide range of products\nand services through\ndifferent platforms\nthat may enhance their\ncompetitive position\nand could result in\nadditional pricing\npressure on our\nbusinesses.\n\nOur ability to access\ncapital at competitive\nrates (which is\ngenerally impacted by,\namong other things,\nour credit spreads and\nratings) and to commit\nand deploy capital\nefficiently,\nparticularly in our\nmore capital-intensive\nbusinesses within our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, including\nunderwriting and\nsales, financing and\nmarket-making\nactivities, also\naffects our\ncompetitive position.\nWe expect clients to\ncontinue to request\nthat we provide loans\nor lending commitments\nin connection with\ncertain investment\nbanking activities.\n\nWe also continue to\nexperience price\ncompetition in our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment\u2019s products. In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities\nand other automated\ntrading platforms, and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies will\nlikely continue the\npressure on our\nrevenues. The trend\ntoward direct access\nto automated,\nelectronic markets\nwill likely continue\nas additional markets\nmove to automated\ntrading platforms.\n\nOur Wealth Management\nbusiness segment is\nprimarily in the U.S.,\nand our ability to\neffectively compete\nagainst many of our\ncompetitors across\ndifferent channels\n(i.e., advisory led,\n                                \n  5    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nworkplace and digital\ndirect) is affected by\nmultiple factors\nincluding our brand\nand reputation, the\nbreadth, depth and\npricing of our product\nofferings and our\ntechnology supporting\nevolving client needs.\n\nWithin our Investment\nManagement business\nsegment, our ability\nto compete\nsuccessfully is\naffected by several\nfactors, including our\nreputation, quality of\ninvestment\nprofessionals,\nperformance of\ninvestment strategies\nor product offerings\nrelative to peers and\nappropriate benchmark\nindices, advertising\nand sales promotion\nefforts, fee levels,\nthe effectiveness of\nand access to\ndistribution channels\nand investment\npipelines, the types\nof products offered,\nand regulatory\nrestrictions specific\nto FHCs. Our\ninvestment products,\nincluding alternative\ninvestment products,\ncompete with\ninvestments offered by\nother investment\nmanagers, including by\ninvestment managers\nwho may be subject to\nless stringent legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan us. For certain\nproducts and\ngeographies, we have\nexperienced and will\nalso likely continue\nto experience\ncompetitive pressures\nin our Investment\nManagement business\nsegment as other\ninvestment managers\nand distributors\ncontinue to put\ndownward pressure on\nfees.\n                                              \n  Supervision and Regulation                  \n                                              \nAs a major financial\nservices firm, we are\nsubject to extensive\nregulation by U.S.\nfederal and state\nregulatory agencies\nand securities\nexchanges and by\nregulators and\nexchanges in each of\nthe major markets\nwhere we conduct our\nbusiness.\n\nWe continue to monitor\nthe changing\npolitical, tax and\nregulatory\nenvironment. While it\nis likely that there\nwill be changes in the\nway major financial\ninstitutions are\nregulated in both the\nU.S. and other markets\nin which we operate,\nit remains difficult\nto predict the exact\nimpact these changes\nwill have on our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition, results of\noperations and cash\nflows for a particular\nfuture period. We\nexpect to remain\nsubject to extensive\nsupervision and\nregulation.\n                                              \n   Financial Holding Company                  \n                                              \nConsolidated\nSupervision.

In\nparticular, we are\nsubject to (among\nother things):\nsignificant regulation\nand supervision;\nintensive scrutiny of\nour businesses and\nplans for expansion of\nthose businesses;\nlimitations on\nactivities; a systemic\nrisk regime that\nimposes heightened\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements;\nrestrictions on\nactivities and\ninvestments imposed by\na section of the BHC\nAct added by the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) referred\nto as the \u201cVolcker\nRule,\u201d and\ncomprehensive\nderivatives\nregulation.

The BHC\nAct limits the\nactivities of BHCs and\nFHCs and grants the\nFederal Reserve\nauthority to limit our\nability to conduct\nactivities. We must\nobtain the Federal\nReserve\u2019s approval\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both in the\nU.S. and\ninternationally.\n\nThe BHC Act\ngrandfathers\n\u201cactivities related to\nthe trading, sale or\ninvestment in\ncommodities and\nunderlying physical\nproperties,\u201d provided\nthat we were engaged\nin \u201cany of such\nactivities as of\nSeptember 30, 1997 in\nthe U.S.\u201d and provided\nthat certain other\nconditions that are\nwithin our reasonable\ncontrol are satisfied.\nWe currently engage in\nour commodities\nactivities pursuant to\nthe BHC Act\ngrandfather exemption,\nas well as other\nauthorities under the\nBHC Act.\n\nActivities\nRestrictions under the\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\nbanking entities,\nincluding us and our\naffiliates, from\nengaging in certain\nproprietary trading\nactivities, as defined\nin the Volcker Rule,\nsubject to exemptions\nfor underwriting,\nmarket-making, risk-\nmitigating hedging and\ncertain other\nactivities. The\nVolcker Rule also\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule, subject to a\nnumber of exemptions\nand exclusions.\n\nCapital Requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve\nestablishes capital\nrequirements largely\nbased on the Basel III\ncapital standards\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nincluding well-\ncapitalized standards,\nfor large BHCs and\nevaluates our\ncompliance with such\nrequirements. The\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cOCC\u201d)\nestablishes similar\ncapital requirements\nand standards for\nMorgan Stanley Bank,\nN.A.

In\naddition to capital\nregulations, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have\nadopted liquidity and\nfunding standards,\nincluding the LCR, the\nNSFR, liquidity stress\ntesting and associated\nliquidity reserve\nrequirements.\n\nFor more information,\nsee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Balance\nSheet\u2014Regulatory\nLiquidity Framework.\u201d\n\nSystemic Risk Regime.\nUnder rules issued by\nthe Federal Reserve,\nlarge BHCs, including\nMorgan Stanley, must\nconduct internal\nliquidity stress\ntests, maintain\nunencumbered highly\nliquid assets to meet\nprojected net cash\noutflows for 30 days\nover the range of\nliquidity stress\nscenarios used in\ninternal stress tests,\nand comply with\nvarious liquidity risk\nmanagement\nrequirements. These\nlarge BHCs also must\ncomply with a range of\nrisk management and\ncorporate governance\nrequirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nalso imposes single-\ncounterparty credit\nlimits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for\nlarge banking\norganizations. U.S.\nglobal systemically\nimportant banks\n(\u201cG-SIBs\u201d), including\nus, are\n\nsubject to a limit of\n15% of Tier 1 capital\nfor aggregate net\ncredit exposures to\nany \u201cmajor\ncounterparty\u201d (defined\nto include other U.S.\nG-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs\nand non-bank\nsystemically important\nfinancial institutions\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve). In\naddition, we are\nsubject to a limit of\n25% of Tier 1 capital\nfor aggregate net\ncredit exposures to\nany other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nmay establish\nadditional prudential\nstandards for large\nBHCs, including with\nrespect to an early\nremediation framework,\ncontingent capital,\nenhanced public\ndisclosures and limits\non short-term debt,\nincluding off-balance\nsheet exposures.

We\nare required to submit\nonce every two years\nto the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC a\nresolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy\nfor a rapid and\norderly resolution\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Interim\nupdates are required\nin certain limited\ncircumstances,\nincluding material\nmergers or\nacquisitions or\nfundamental changes to\nour resolution\nstrategy.\n\nOur preferred\nresolution strategy,\nwhich is set out in\nour most recent\nresolution plan, is an\nSPOE strategy, which\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy after the\nParent Company has\nfiled for bankruptcy.\n\nOur next resolution\nplan submission will\nbe a targeted\nresolution plan in\nJuly 2025. Further, we\nsubmit an annual\nrecovery plan to the\nFederal Reserve that\noutlines the steps\nthat management could\ntake over time to\ngenerate or conserve\nfinancial resources in\ntimes of prolonged\nfinancial stress.\n\nCertain of our\ndomestic and foreign\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution\nand recovery planning\nrequirements in the\njurisdictions in which\nthey operate. The FDIC\ncurrently requires\ncertain insured\ndepository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries, to\nsubmit full resolution\nplans every two years\nand interim targeted\ninformation at certain\ntimes between full\nresolution plan\nsubmissions that\ndescribe the IDI\u2019s\nstrategy for a rapid\nand orderly resolution\nin the event of\nmaterial financial\ndistress or\n                                \n  7    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nfailure of the IDI.\nSubmission of interim\ntargeted information\nby our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries generally\nwill not be required\nduring a year which\nthe Parent Company is\nrequired to submit a\nresolution plan to the\nFederal Reserve and\nFDIC. The first\nsubmission for our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\nunder this rule will\nbe in 2026. In\naddition, the OCC\nrequires IDIs with\nassets of $100 billion\nor more, including our\nU.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries, to\ndevelop recovery plans\ndetailing the actions\nthey would take to\nremain a going concern\nwhen they experience\nconsiderable financial\nor non-financial\nstress, but have not\ndeteriorated to the\npoint that resolution\nis imminent.

These\ninclude the level and\nvolatility of equity,\nfixed income and\ncommodity prices; the\nlevel, term structure\nand volatility of\ninterest rates;\ninflation, currency\nvalues and\nunemployment rates;\nthe level of other\nmarket indices, fiscal\nor monetary policies\nestablished by\ngovernments, central\nbanks and financial\nregulators; and\nuncertainty concerning\nthe future path of\ninterest rates,\ngovernment shutdowns,\ndebt ceilings or\nfunding, which may be\ndriven by economic\nconditions,\nrecessionary fears,\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of confidence\namong investors and\nclients due to the\neffects of widespread\nevents such as global\npandemics, natural\ndisasters, climate-\nrelated incidents,\nacts of war or\naggression,\ngeopolitical\ninstability, changes\nas a result of global\nelections, including\nchanges in U.S.\npresidential\nadministrations or\nCongress, changes to\nglobal trade policies,\nsupply chain\ncomplications and the\nimplementation of\ntariffs, protectionist\ntrade policies, trade\nsanctions or\ninvestment\nrestrictions and other\nfactors, or a\ncombination of these\nor other factors.\n\nThe results of our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, particularly\nresults relating to\nour involvement in\nprimary and secondary\nmarkets for all types\nof financial products,\nare subject to\nsubstantial market\nfluctuations due to a\nvariety of factors\nthat we cannot control\nor predict with great\ncertainty. These\nfluctuations impact\nresults by causing\nvariations in business\nflows and activity and\nin the fair value of\nsecurities and other\nfinancial products.\nFluctuations also\noccur due to the level\nof global market\nactivity, which, among\nother things,\n\ncan be impacted by\nmarket uncertainty or\nlack of investor and\nclient confidence due\nto unforeseen\neconomic, geopolitical\nor market conditions\nthat in turn affect\nthe size, number and\ntiming of investment\nbanking client\nassignments and\ntransactions and the\nrealization of returns\nfrom our principal\ninvestments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable\nmarket or economic\nconditions, including\nequity market levels\nand the level and pace\nof changes in interest\nrates and asset\nvaluation, may have\nadverse impacts on the\nlevel of individual\ninvestor confidence\nand participation in\nthe global markets\nand/or the level of\nand mix of client\nassets, including\ndeposits. This could\nalso impact the level\nof net new asset flows\nand/or flows into fee-\nbased assets. Any of\nthese factors could\nnegatively impact the\nresults of our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nSubstantial market\nfluctuations or\ndivergence in asset\nperformance could also\ncause variations in\nthe value of our\ninvestments in our\nfunds, the flow of\ninvestment capital\ninto or from AUM, and\nthe way customers\nallocate capital among\nmoney market, equity,\nfixed income or other\ninvestment\nalternatives, which\ncould negatively\nimpact the results of\nour Investment\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nThe value of our\nfinancial instruments\nmay be materially\naffected by market\nfluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and\ndisruptions in the\nmarkets may make it\ndifficult to value and\nmonetize certain of\nour financial\ninstruments,\nparticularly during\nperiods of market\nuncertainty or\ndisplacement.\nSubsequent valuations\nin future periods, in\nlight of factors then\nprevailing, may result\nin significant changes\nin the value of these\ninstruments and may\nadversely impact\nhistorical or\nprospective fees and\nperformance-based\nincome (also known as\nincentive fees, which\ninclude carried\ninterest) in respect\nof certain businesses.\nIn addition, at the\ntime of any sales and\nsettlements of these\nfinancial instruments,\nthe price we\nultimately realize\nwill depend on the\ndemand and liquidity\nin the market at that\ntime and may be\nmaterially lower than\ntheir current fair\nvalue. Any of these\nfactors could cause a\ndecline in the value\nof our financial\ninstruments, which may\nadversely affect our\nresults of operations\nin future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial\nmarkets are\nsusceptible to severe\nevents evidenced by\nrapid depreciation in\nasset values\naccompanied by a\nreduction in asset\nliquidity. Under these\nextreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be as\neffective at\nmitigating trading\nlosses as they would\nbe under more normal\nmarket conditions.\nMoreover, under these\nconditions, market\nparticipants are\nparticularly exposed\nto trading strategies\nemployed by many\nmarket participants\nsimultaneously and on\na large scale, which\ncould lead to\nincreased individual\ncounterparty risk for\nour businesses.\nAlthough our risk\nmanagement and\nmonitoring processes\nseek to quantify and\nmitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves,\nsevere market events\nhave historically been\ndifficult to predict,\nand we could realize\nsignificant losses if\nextreme market events\nwere to occur.\n                                 \n  13    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nSignificant changes to\ninterest rates could\nadversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n\nOur net interest\nincome is sensitive to\nchanges in interest\nrates, generally\nresulting in higher\nnet interest income in\nhigher interest rate\nscenarios and lower\nnet interest income in\nlower interest rate\nscenarios. The level\nand pace of interest\nrate changes, along\nwith other\ndevelopments, such as\npricing changes to\ncertain deposit types\ndue to various\ncompetitive dynamics\nand alternative cash-\nequivalent products\navailable to\ndepositors, have in\nthe past impacted, and\ncould again impact,\nclient preferences for\ncash allocation and\nthe pace of\nreallocation of client\nbalances, resulting in\nchanges in the deposit\nmix and associated\ninterest expense, as\nwell as client demand\nfor loans. These\nfactors have in the\npast adversely\naffected, and may in\nthe future adversely\naffect, our results of\noperations, including\nour net interest\nincome.\n\nHolding large and\nconcentrated positions\nmay expose us to\nlosses.\n\nConcentration of risk\nmay reduce revenues or\nresult in losses in\nour market-making,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting\n(including block\ntrading) and lending\nbusinesses (including\nmargin lending) in the\nevent of unfavorable\nmarket movements.

If the\nFederal Reserve and\nthe FDIC were to\njointly determine that\nour resolution plan\nsubmission was not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution, and if we\nwere unsuccessful in\naddressing any\ndeficiencies\nidentified by the\nregulators, we or any\nof our subsidiaries\nmay be subject to more\nstringent capital,\nleverage or liquidity\nrequirements or\nrestrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or after a\ntwo-year period, we\nmay be required to\ndivest assets or\noperations.\n\nIn addition, provided\nthat certain\nprocedures are met, we\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority\nunder Title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act with\nthe FDIC being\nappointed as receiver\ninstead of being\nresolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe FDIC\u2019s power under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nto disregard the\npriority of creditor\nclaims and treat\nsimilarly situated\ncreditors differently\nin certain\ncircumstances, subject\nto certain\nlimitations, could\nadversely impact\nholders of our\nunsecured debt.

The\nParent Company has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to the\nFunding IHC. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nmaterial assets that\ncan be contributed\nunder the terms of the\namended and restated\nsupport\n                                 \n  19    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nagreement (other than\nshares in subsidiaries\nof the Parent Company\nand certain other\nassets) to the Funding\nIHC. The Funding IHC\nwould be obligated to\nprovide capital and\nliquidity, as\napplicable, to certain\nsupported\nsubsidiaries, pursuant\nto the terms of the\nsecured amended and\nrestated support\nagreement.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and of\nthe Funding IHC,\nrespectively, under\nthe amended and\nrestated support\nagreement are in most\ncases secured on a\nsenior basis by the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany (other than\nshares in subsidiaries\nof the Parent Company\nand certain other\nassets), and the\nassets of the Funding\nIHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of\ncertain supported\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, against the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany with respect\nto such secured assets\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE\nstrategy, whether\napplied pursuant to\nour resolution plan or\nin a resolution\nproceeding under the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, is intended\nto result in better\noutcomes for creditors\noverall, there is no\nguarantee that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy, including\nthe provision of\nsupport to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s supported\nsubsidiaries pursuant\nto the secured amended\nand restated support\nagreement, will not\nresult in greater\nlosses for holders of\nour securities\ncompared with a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy for us.\n\nRegulators have taken\nand proposed various\nactions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, the orderly\nliquidation authority\nand other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequires top-tier BHCs\nof U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to\nmaintain adequate\nTLAC, including equity\nand eligible long-term\ndebt, in order to\nensure that such\ninstitutions have\nenough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point\nof failure to be\nrecapitalized through\nthe conversion of debt\nto equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on\neligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is\nused. The combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the TLAC\nrequirement is that\nour losses will be\nimposed on the holders\nof eligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\nthe creditors of our\nsupported subsidiaries\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nE.U. jurisdictions,\nhave implemented\nchanges to resolution\nregimes to provide\nresolution authorities\nwith the ability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity organized in\nsuch jurisdiction by\nwriting down certain\nunsecured liabilities\nor converting certain\nunsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers are\nintended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured creditors.\nThis may increase the\noverall level of\ncapital and liquidity\nrequired by us on a\nconsolidated basis and\nmay result in\nlimitations on our\nability to efficiently\ndistribute capital and\nliquidity among our\naffiliated entities,\nincluding in times of\nstress. Non-U.S.\nregulators are also\nconsidering\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum\n\namounts of TLAC that\nwould pass losses up\nfrom the subsidiaries\nto the Parent Company\nand, ultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe Parent Company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented\nfrom paying dividends\nor taking other\ncapital actions\nbecause of regulatory\nconstraints or revised\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve,\nincluding with respect\nto regulatory capital\nrequirements, stress\ntesting and capital\nplanning. We submit,\non at least an annual\nbasis, a capital plan\nto the Federal Reserve\ndescribing proposed\ndividend payments to\nshareholders, proposed\nrepurchases of our\noutstanding securities\nand other proposed\ncapital actions that\nwe intend to take. Our\nability to take\ncapital actions\ndescribed in the\ncapital plan is\ndependent on, among\nother factors, the\nresults of supervisory\nstress tests conducted\nby the Federal Reserve\nand our compliance\nwith regulatory\ncapital requirements\nimposed by the Federal\nReserve.\n\nIn addition, the\nFederal Reserve may\nchange regulatory\ncapital requirements\nto impose higher\nrequirements that\nrestrict our ability\nto take capital\nactions or may modify\nor impose other\nregulatory standards\nor restrictions that\nincrease our operating\nexpenses or constrain\nour ability to take\ncapital actions.

However,\nidentifying and\nmitigating potential\nconflicts of interest\ncan be complex and\nchallenging and can\nbecome the focus of\nmedia and regulatory\nscrutiny. Indeed,\nactions that merely\nappear to create a\nconflict can put our\nreputation at risk\neven if the likelihood\nof an actual conflict\nhas been mitigated. It\nis possible that\npotential conflicts\ncould give rise to\nlitigation or\nenforcement actions,\nwhich may lead to our\nclients being less\nwilling to enter into\ntransactions in which\na conflict may occur\nand could adversely\naffect our businesses\nand reputation.\n\nOur regulators also\nhave the ability to\nscrutinize our\nactivities for\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nthrough detailed\nexaminations of\nspecific transactions.\nFor example, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve\nsubjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve\nscrutiny with respect\nto transactions\nbetween our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates. Further,\nthe Volcker Rule\nsubjects us to\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding certain\ntransactions between\nus and our clients.\n                                              \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nOur risk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposures in all\nmarket environments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, which could\nresult in unexpected\nlosses.\n\nWe have devoted\nsignificant resources\nto develop our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nmodels and processes,\nincluding our use of\nvarious risk models\nfor assessing market,\ncredit, liquidity and\noperational exposures\nand hedging\nstrategies, stress\ntesting and other\nanalysis capabilities,\nand expect to continue\nto do so in the\nfuture. Nonetheless,\nour risk management\ncapabilities may not\nbe fully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposure in all market\nenvironments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, including risks\nthat are unidentified\nor unanticipated.\n                                 \n  21    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nAs our businesses\nchange and grow,\nincluding through\nacquisitions and the\nintroduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies, such as\nartificial\nintelligence, and the\nmarkets in which we\noperate evolve, our\nrisk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not\nalways adapt with\nthose changes. Some of\nour methods of\nmanaging risk are\nbased upon our use of\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\nAs a result, these\nmethods may not\npredict future risk\nexposures, which could\nbe significantly\ngreater than the\nhistorical measures\nindicate.\n\nIn addition, many\nmodels we use are\nbased on assumptions\nor inputs regarding\ncorrelations among\nprices of various\nasset classes or other\nmarket indicators and,\ntherefore, cannot\nanticipate sudden,\nunanticipated or\nunidentified market or\neconomic movements,\nsuch as the impact of\na pandemic or a sudden\ngeopolitical conflict,\nwhich could cause us\nto incur losses.\n\nManagement of market,\ncredit, liquidity,\noperational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and\ncompliance risks\nrequires, among other\nthings, policies and\nprocedures to record\nproperly and verify a\nlarge number of\ntransactions and\nevents, and these\npolicies and\nprocedures may not be\nfully effective. Our\ntrading risk\nmanagement strategies\nand techniques also\nseek to balance our\nability to profit from\ntrading positions with\nour exposure to\npotential losses.\n\nWhile we employ a\nbroad and diversified\nset of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the timing\nof such outcomes. For\nexample, to the extent\nthat our trading or\ninvesting activities\ninvolve less liquid\ntrading markets or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sales\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and,\ntherefore, reduce our\nrisk associated with\nsuch positions. We\nmay, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course\nof our trading or\ninvesting activities.\nFor more information\non how we monitor and\nmanage market and\ncertain other risks\nand related\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Market Risk.\u201d\n\nClimate change\nmanifesting as\nphysical or transition\nrisks could result in\nincreased costs and\nrisks and adversely\naffect our operations,\nbusinesses and\nclients.\n\nThere continues to be\nincreasing concern\nover the risks of\nclimate change and\nrelated sustainability\nmatters. The physical\nrisks of climate\nchange include harm to\npeople and property\narising from acute,\nclimate-related\nevents, such as\nfloods, hurricanes,\nheatwaves, droughts\nand wildfires, and\nchronic, longer-term\nshifts in climate\npatterns, such as\nhigher global average\ntemperatures, rising\nsea levels and long-\nterm droughts. Such\nevents could disrupt\nour operations or\nthose of our clients\nor third parties on\nwhich we rely,\nincluding through\ndirect damage to\nphysical assets and\nindirect impacts from\nsupply chain\ndisruption and market\nvolatility. These\nevents could impact\nthe ability of certain\nof our clients or\n\ncustomers to repay\ntheir obligations,\nreduce the value of\ncollateral, increase\ncosts, including the\ncost or availability\nof insurance coverage,\nand result in other\nadverse effects.\n\nThe transition risks\nof climate change\ninclude policy, legal,\ntechnology and market\nchanges. Examples of\nthese transition risks\ninclude changes in\nconsumer and business\nsentiment, related\ntechnologies,\nshareholder\npreferences and any\nadditional regulatory\nand legislative\nrequirements,\nincluding increased\ndisclosure or\nregulation of carbon\nemissions. These risks\ncould increase our\nexpenses and adversely\nimpact our strategies.\nNegative impacts to\ncertain of our\nclients, such as\ndecreased\nprofitability and\nasset write-downs,\ncould also lead to\nincreased credit and\nliquidity risk to us.\n\nIn addition, our\nreputation and client\nrelationships may be\nadversely impacted as\na result of our, or\nour clients\u2019,\ninvolvement in certain\npractices that may\nhave, or are\nassociated with\nhaving, an adverse\nimpact on climate\nchange. Legislative or\nregulatory change\nregarding climate-\nrelated risks,\nincluding inconsistent\nrequirements and\nuncertainties, could\nresult in loss of\nrevenue, or increased\ncredit, market,\nliquidity, regulatory,\ncompliance,\nreputational and other\nrisks and costs.\n\nOur ability to achieve\nour climate-related\ntargets and\ncommitments and the\nway we go about this\ncould also result in\nreputational harm as a\nresult of public\nsentiment, legislative\nand regulatory\nscrutiny (including\nfrom U.S. federal and\nstate governments and\nforeign policymakers\nand regulators),\nlitigation and reduced\ninvestor and\nstakeholder\nconfidence. If we are\nunable to achieve our\nobjectives relating to\nclimate change or our\ncurrent response to\nclimate change is\nperceived to be\nineffective or\ninsufficient, or the\nway we respond is\nperceived negatively,\nour business and\nreputation may suffer.\n\nThe risks associated\nwith, and the\nperspective of\nregulators,\ngovernments,\nshareholders,\nemployees and other\nstakeholders regarding\nclimate change, as\nwell as geopolitical\nevents, continue to\nevolve rapidly, making\nit difficult to assess\nthe ultimate impact on\nus of climate-related\nrisks and\nuncertainties. As\nclimate risk is\ninterconnected with\nother risks, we have\ndeveloped and continue\nto enhance processes\nto embed climate risk\nconsiderations into\nour risk management\npractices and\ngovernance structures.\nDespite our risk\nmanagement practices,\nthe unpredictability\nsurrounding the timing\nand severity of\nclimate-related\nevents, and societal\nor political changes\nin reaction to them,\nmake it difficult to\npredict, identify,\nmonitor and mitigate\nclimate risks.\n\nIn addition, the\nmethodologies and data\nused to manage and\nmonitor climate risk\ncontinue to evolve.\nCurrent approaches\nutilize information\nand estimates that\nhave been derived from\ninformation or factors\nreleased by third-\nparty sources, which\nmay not reflect the\nlatest or most\naccurate data.\nClimate-related data,\nparticularly\ngreenhouse gas\nemissions for clients\nand counterparties,\nremains limited in\navailability and\nvaries in quality.\nCertain third-party\ninformation may also\nchange\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    22  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nover time as\nmethodologies evolve\nand are refined. While\nwe believe this\ninformation is the\nbest available at the\ntime, we may only be\nable to complete\nlimited validation.\nFurthermore, modeling\ncapabilities and\nmethodologies to\nanalyze climate-\nrelated risks,\nalthough improving,\nremain nascent and\nemerging and are\nsubject to uncertainty\ndue to limited\nhistorical trend\ninformation and the\nabsence of\nstandardized and\ncomprehensive data.\nThese and other\nfactors could cause\nresults to differ\nmaterially, which\ncould impact our\nability to manage\nclimate-related risks.\n                                              \n  Competitive Environment                     \n                                              \nWe face strong\ncompetition from\nfinancial services\nfirms and others,\nwhich could lead to\npricing pressures that\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nrevenues and\nprofitability.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry and all\naspects of our\nbusinesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. We compete\nwith commercial banks,\nglobal investment\nbanks, regional banks,\nbroker-dealers, wire\nhouses, private banks,\nregistered investment\nadvisers, digital\ninvesting platforms,\ntraditional and\nalternative asset\nmanagers, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial and\nancillary services in\nthe U.S. and globally.\nWe compete on the\nbasis of several\nfactors, including\ntransaction execution,\ncapital or access to\ncapital, products and\nservices, innovation,\ntechnology,\nreputation, risk\nappetite and price.\n\nWe have experienced,\nand will likely\ncontinue to\nexperience, increased\ncompetition in the\nU.S. and globally\ndriven by established\nfinancial services\nfirms and emerging\nfirms, including non-\nfinancial companies\nand business models\nfocusing on technology\ninnovation, competing\nfor the same clients\nand assets, or\noffering similar\nproducts and services\nto retail and\ninstitutional\ncustomers. It is also\npossible that\ncompetition may become\neven more intense as\nwe continue to compete\nwith financial or\nother institutions\nthat may be, or will\nbecome, larger, or\nbetter capitalized, or\nmay have a stronger\nlocal presence and\nlonger operating\nhistory in certain\ngeographies or\nproducts.\n\nWe have experienced,\nand may continue to\nexperience, pricing\npressures as a result\nof these factors and\nas some of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nreducing prices and\nfees, paying higher\ninterest rates on\ndeposits, eliminating\ncommissions or other\nfees or otherwise\nproviding more\nfavorable terms of\nbusiness. In addition,\ncertain of our\ncompetitors may be\nsubject to different\nand, in some cases,\nless stringent, legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan we are, thereby\nputting us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage.

In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities\nand other automated\ntrading platforms, and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies,\nincluding generative\nartificial\nintelligence, will\nlikely continue the\npressure on revenues.\nThe trend toward\ndirect access to\nautomated, electronic\nmarkets will likely\ncontinue as additional\nmarkets move to more\nautomated trading\nplatforms. We have\nexperienced, and will\nlikely continue to\nexperience,\ncompetitive pressures\nin these and other\nareas in the future.\n\nOur ability to retain\nand attract qualified\nemployees is critical\nto the success of our\nbusiness and the\nfailure to do so may\nmaterially adversely\naffect our\nperformance.\n\nOur people are our\nmost important asset.\nWe compete with\nvarious other\ncompanies in\nattracting and\nretaining qualified\nand skilled personnel.\nIf we are unable to\ncontinue to attract,\nintegrate and retain\nhighly qualified\nemployees or\nsuccessfully\ntransition key roles,\nor do so at levels or\nin forms necessary to\nmaintain our\ncompetitive position,\nour performance,\nincluding our\ncompetitive position\nand results of\noperations, could be\nmaterially adversely\naffected. Our ability\nto attract and retain\nqualified and skilled\npersonnel depends on\nnumerous factors, some\nof which are outside\nof our control.\n\nCompensation costs\nrequired to attract\nand retain employees\nmay increase or the\ncompetitive market for\ntalent may further\nintensify due to\nfactors such as low\nunemployment, a strong\njob market and changes\nin employees\u2019\nexpectations, concerns\nand preferences. The\nfinancial industry has\nexperienced, and may\ncontinue to\nexperience, more\nstringent regulation\nof employee\ncompensation than\nother industries,\nwhich may or may not\nimpact competitors.\nThese more stringent\nregulations have\nshaped our\ncompensation\npractices, which could\nhave an adverse effect\non our ability to hire\nor retain the most\nqualified employees.\n                                              \n  International Risk                          \n                                              \nWe are subject to\nnumerous political,\neconomic, legal, tax,\noperational, franchise\nand other risks as a\nresult of our\ninternational\noperations that could\nadversely impact our\nbusinesses in many\nways.\n\nWe are subject to\nnumerous political,\neconomic, legal, tax,\noperational, franchise\nand other risks that\nare inherent in\noperating in many\ncountries, including\nrisks of possible\nnationalization,\nexpropriation, price\ncontrols, capital\ncontrols, exchange\ncontrols, increased\ntaxes and levies,\ncybersecurity, data\ntransfer and\noutsourcing\nrestrictions,\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding the use of\nnew technologies,\nprohibitions on\ncertain\n                                 \n  23    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntypes of foreign and\ncapital market\nactivities,\nlimitations on cross-\nborder listings and\nother restrictive\ngovernmental actions,\nas well as the\noutbreak of\nhostilities or\npolitical and\ngovernmental\ninstability, including\ntensions between China\nand the U.S., the\nexpansion or\nescalation of\nhostilities between\nRussia and Ukraine or\nin the Middle East, or\nthe initiation or\nescalation of\nhostilities or\nterrorist activity\naround the world and\nthe potential\nassociated impacts on\nglobal and local\neconomies and our\noperations.

A\n\u201cnon-GAAP financial\nmeasure\u201d excludes, or\nincludes, amounts from\nthe most directly\ncomparable measure\ncalculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP. We consider the\nnon-GAAP financial\nmeasures we disclose\nto be useful to us,\ninvestors, analysts\nand other stakeholders\nby providing further\ntransparency about, or\nan alternate means of\nassessing or comparing\nour financial\ncondition, operating\nresults and capital\nadequacy. These\nmeasures are not in\naccordance with, or a\nsubstitute for, U.S.\nGAAP and may be\ndifferent from or\ninconsistent with non-\nGAAP financial\nmeasures used by other\ncompanies. Whenever we\nrefer to a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, we\nwill also generally\ndefine it or present\nthe most directly\ncomparable financial\nmeasure calculated and\npresented in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP, along with a\nreconciliation of the\ndifferences between\nthe U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measure and\nthe non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. We present\ncertain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures\nthat exclude the\nimpact of mark-to-\nmarket gains and\nlosses, net of\nfinancing costs on DCP\ninvestments from net\nrevenues. We also\nexclude the impact of\nmark-to-market gains\nand losses on DCP from\ncompensation expenses.\nThe impact of DCP\ninvestments and DCP\nare primarily\nreflected in our\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nresults. These\nmeasures allow for\nbetter comparability\nof period-to-period\nunderlying operating\nperformance and\nrevenue trends. By\nexcluding the impact\nof these items, we are\nbetter able to\ndescribe the business\ndrivers and resulting\nimpact to net revenues\nand\n\ncorresponding change\nto the associated\ncompensation expenses.\nFor additional\ninformation on DCP,\nrefer to \u201cOther\nMatters\u201d herein.\nTangible common equity\nis a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that\nwe believe analysts,\ninvestors and other\nstakeholders consider\nuseful to allow for\ncomparability to peers\nand of the period-to-\nperiod use of our\nequity. The\ncalculation of\ntangible common equity\nrepresents common\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and\nintangible assets net\nof allowable mortgage\nservicing rights\ndeduction. In\naddition, we believe\nthat certain ratios\nthat utilize tangible\ncommon equity, such as\nreturn on average\ntangible common equity\n(\u201cROTCE\u201d) and tangible\nbook value per common\nshare, also non-GAAP\nfinancial measures,\nare useful for\nevaluating the\noperating performance\nand capital adequacy\nof the business\nperiod-to-period,\nrespectively. The\ncalculation of ROTCE\nrepresents annualized\nearnings applicable to\nMorgan Stanley common\nshareholders as a\npercentage of average\ntangible common\nequity. The\ncalculation of\ntangible book value\nper common share\nrepresents tangible\ncommon equity divided\nby common shares\noutstanding.

Includes Investments and Trading, Net\ninterest and Other revenues.\n\nNet Revenues Asset Management and Related Fees\nAsset management and related fees of $5,627\nmillion in 2024 increased 8% compared with the\nprior year, primarily driven by higher average\nAUM on higher market levels. Asset management\nrevenues are influenced by the level, relative\nmix of AUM and related fee rates. While higher\nmarket levels drove increases in average AUM\nin the current year period, there were\ncontinued net outflows in the Equity asset\nclass, which may be influenced by the\nstructure and performance of our investment\nstrategies and products relative to their\nbenchmarks, offset by higher net inflows in\nthe Alternatives and Solutions and Fixed\nIncome asset classes reflecting client\npreferences. To the extent these conditions\ncontinue, we would expect our Asset management\nrevenue to continue to be impacted. See\n\u201cAssets Under Management or Supervision\u201d\nherein. Performance-based Income and Other\nPerformance-based income and other revenues\nincreased to $234 million in 2024, from $139\nmillion in the prior year, primarily due to\nhigher accrued carried interest in\ninfrastructure and real estate funds,\npartially offset by lower accrued carried\ninterest in certain private equity funds. Non-\nInterest Expenses Non-interest expenses of\n$4,724 million in 2024 increased 4% from the\nprior year, as a result of higher Non-\ncompensation and Compensation and benefits\nexpenses. \u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher compensation\nassociated with carried interest. \u2022 Non-\ncompensation expenses increased primarily due\nto higher distribution expenses on higher AUM.\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    38  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAssets Under\nManagement or\nSupervision\nRollforwards\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n1.

Employees\nare permitted to\nallocate the value of\ntheir deferred awards\namong a menu of\nnotional investments,\nwhereby the value of\ntheir awards will\ntrack the performance\nof the referenced\nnotional investments.\nThe menu of\ninvestments, which is\nselected by the Firm,\nincludes fixed income,\nequity, commodity and\nmoney market funds.\nCompensation expense\nfor DCP awards is\ncalculated based on\nthe notional value of\nthe award granted,\nadjusted for changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments that\nemployees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards. We invest\ndirectly, as\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of our\nobligations under\nthese DCP awards.\nChanges in the fair\nvalue of such\ninvestments, net of\nfinancing costs, are\nrecorded in net\nrevenues, and included\nin Transactional\nrevenues in the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nrecognized in net\nrevenues, there is\ntypically a timing\ndifference between the\nimmediate recognition\nof gains and losses on\nour investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nmay not be material to\nour Income before\nprovision for income\ntaxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment reported\nratios and operating\nmetrics in certain\nperiods due to\npotentially\nsignificant impacts to\nnet revenues and\ncompensation expenses.\nAt December 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023,\nsubstantially all\nemployee-referenced\ninvestments that\nsubjected the Firm to\nprice risk were\neconomically hedged.\nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026        2024        2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deferr\u2026                                     \n  cash-b\u2026    $    770    $    693    $   761  \n  awards                                      \n  Return                                      \n  on              672         668       -716  \n  refere\u2026                                     \n  invest\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $  1,442    $  1,361    $    45  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \nAmounts Recognized in\nCompensation Expense\nby Segment\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millio\u2026        2024        2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Instit\u2026    $    150    $    162    $   -97  \n  Securi\u2026                                     \n  Wealth        1,100         984         11  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Invest\u2026         192         215        131  \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  Total                                       \n  recogn\u2026                                     \n  in         $  1,442    $  1,361    $    45  \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  expense                                     \n                                              \n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    40  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nProjected Future\nCompensation\nObligation 1\n                                              \n  $ in millions                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Award liabilities at December     $  5,658  \n  31, 20242, 3                                \n  Fully vested amounts to be                  \n  distributed by the end                -772  \n  of February 20254                           \n  Unrecognized portion of prior               \n  awards at December                   1,590  \n  31, 20243                                   \n  2024 performance year awards           432  \n  granted in 20253                            \n  Total5                            $  6,908  \n                                              \n1.

We are currently\nevaluating the following accounting updates;\nhowever, we do not expect a material impact on\nour financial condition or results of\noperations upon adoption: \u2022 Disaggregation of\nIncome Statement Expenses. This update\nrequires quantitative and qualitative\ndisclosure of certain expense categories\ncontained within their relevant expense lines\nin the income statement, including but not\nlimited to: (1) employee compensation; (2)\ndepreciation; and (3) intangible asset\namortization. The update requires the\ndisaggregation of these expense lines in a\ntabular format in the notes to the financial\nstatements, including the separate disclosure\nof certain other expenses and gains or losses\nincluded within these expense lines which are\nrequired under existing U.S. GAAP, with all\nother expenses permitted to be disclosed in an\n\u201cother items\u201d category. Additionally, the\nupdate requires disclosure of the total amount\nand definition of the Firm\u2019s selling expenses.\nThe update is effective for annual periods\nbeginning January 1, 2027, and interim\nreporting periods beginning January 1, 2028,\nwith early adoption permitted. \u2022 Income Tax\nDisclosures. This update enhances annual\nincome tax disclosures primarily to further\ndisaggregate disclosures related to the income\ntax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.\nFor the income tax rate reconciliation, this\nupdate requires (1) disclosure of specific\ncategories of reconciling items (where\napplicable), and (2) providing additional\ninformation for reconciling items that meet a\nquantitative threshold. For income taxes paid\n(net of refunds), this update requires\ndisclosure of amounts disaggregated by (1)\nfederal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2)\nindividual jurisdictions that meet a\nquantitative threshold. Additionally, the\nupdate requires disclosure of (1) income (or\nloss) before income taxes, disaggregated\nbetween domestic and foreign; and (2) income\ntax expense disaggregated by federal, state\nand foreign.

We\nbelieve that of our significant accounting\npolicies (see Note 2 to the financial\nstatements), the following policies involve a\nhigher degree of judgment and complexity.\n                                 \n  41    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n   Financial Instruments Measured at Fair     \n   Value                                      \n                                              \nA significant number\nof our financial\ninstruments are\ncarried at fair value.\nThe use of fair value\nto measure financial\ninstruments is\nfundamental to our\nrisk management\npractices and is our\nmost critical\naccounting estimate.\nWe make estimates\nregarding the\nvaluation of assets\nand liabilities\nmeasured at fair value\nin preparing the\nfinancial statements.\nThese assets and\nliabilities include,\nbut are not limited\nto:\n\n\u2022 Trading assets and\nTrading liabilities;\n\n\u2022 Investment\nSecurities\u2014AFS;\n\n\u2022 Certain Securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell;\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n(measured at the lower\nof amortized cost or\nfair value);\n\n\u2022 Certain Deposits,\nprimarily certificates\nof deposit;\n\n\u2022 Certain Securities\nsold under agreements\nto repurchase;\n\n\u2022 Certain Other\nsecured financings;\nand\n\n\u2022 Certain Borrowings.\n\nFair value is defined\nas the price that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability (i.e., the\nexit price) in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date.\n\nIn determining fair\nvalue, we use various\nvaluation approaches.\nA hierarchy for inputs\nis used in measuring\nfair value that\nmaximizes the use of\nobservable prices and\ninputs, and minimizes\nthe use of\nunobservable prices\nand inputs by\nrequiring that the\nrelevant observable\ninputs be used when\navailable. The\nhierarchy is broken\ndown into three\nlevels: wherein Level\n1 represents quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets, Level 2\nrepresents valuations\nbased on quoted prices\nin markets that are\nnot active or for\nwhich all significant\ninputs are observable,\nand Level 3 consists\nof valuation\ntechniques that\nincorporate\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nand, therefore,\nrequire the greatest\nuse of judgment. The\nfair values for the\nsubstantial majority\nof our financial\nassets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value\nare based on\nobservable prices and\ninputs and are\nclassified in level 1\nor 2, of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Level\n3 financial assets\nrepresented 0.9% and\n1.2% of our total\nassets, as of December\n31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023,\nrespectively.\n\nIn periods of market\ndisruption, the\nobservability of\nprices and inputs, as\nwell as market\nliquidity, may be\nreduced for many\ninstruments, which\ncould cause an\ninstrument to be\nrecategorized from\nLevel 1 to Level 2 or\nfrom Level 2 to Level\n3. In addition, a\ndownturn in market\nconditions could lead\nto declines in the\nvaluation of many\ninstruments carried at\nfair value.\nImprecision in\nestimating\nunobservable market\ninputs or other\nfactors can affect the\namount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a\nparticular position.\nThe Firm uses various\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in the\ndetermination of fair\nvalue. The use of\nmethodologies or\nassumptions different\nthan those used by the\nFirm could result in a\ndifferent estimate of\nfair value at the\nreporting date. For\nfurther information on\nthe\n\ndefinition of fair\nvalue, Level 1, Level\n2, Level 3 and related\nvaluation techniques,\nand quantitative\ninformation about and\nsensitivity of\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nused in Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements,\nsee Notes 2 and 4 to\nthe financial\nstatements.\n\nWhere appropriate,\nvaluation adjustments\nare made to account\nfor various factors,\nsuch as liquidity risk\n(bid-ask adjustments),\ncredit quality, model\nuncertainty,\nconcentration risk and\nfunding, in order to\narrive at fair value.\nFor a further\ndiscussion of\nvaluation adjustments\nthat we apply, see\nNote 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Intangible Assets              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe test goodwill for\nimpairment on an\nannual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\nEvaluating goodwill\nfor impairment\nrequires management to\nmake significant\njudgments, including,\nin part, the use of\nunobservable inputs\nthat are subject to\nuncertainty. Goodwill\nimpairment tests are\nperformed at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below our\nbusiness segments.\nGoodwill no longer\nretains its\nassociation with a\nparticular acquisition\nonce it has been\nassigned to a\nreporting unit. As\nsuch, all the\nactivities of a\nreporting unit,\nwhether acquired or\norganically developed,\nare available to\nsupport the value of\nthe goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, we\nhave the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\n\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, we\ncompare the fair value\nof a reporting unit\nwith its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited by the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\n\nThe carrying value of\neach reporting unit is\ndetermined based on\nthe capital allocated\nto the reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunits is derived based\non valuation\ntechniques we believe\nmarket participants\nwould use for each of\nthe reporting units.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue is generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology.\nIn certain instances,\nwe may also utilize\nmethodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncomparable companies.\n\nThe discounted cash\nflow methodology uses\nprojected future cash\nflows based on the\nreporting units\u2019\nearnings forecast. The\ndiscount rate used\nrepresents an estimate\nof the cost of equity\nfor that reporting\nunit based on the\nCapital Asset Pricing\nModel.\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    42  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAt each annual\ngoodwill impairment\ntesting date, each of\nour reporting units\nwith goodwill had a\nfair value that was\nsubstantially in\nexcess of its carrying\nvalue.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nIntangible assets are\ninitially recorded at\ncost, or in the\nsituation where\nacquired as part of a\nbusiness combination,\nat the fair value\ndetermined as part of\nthe acquisition method\nof accounting.\nSubsequently,\namortizable intangible\nassets are carried in\nthe balance sheet at\namortized cost, where\namortization is\nrecognized over their\nestimated useful\nlives. Indefinite-\nlived intangible\nassets are not\namortized but are\ntested for impairment\non an annual basis as\nof July 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\n\nOn a quarterly basis:\n\n\u2022 All intangible\nassets are assessed\nfor the presence of\nimpairment indicators.\nWhere such indicators\nare present, an\nevaluation for\nimpairment is\nconducted.\n\n\u2022 For amortizable\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment loss exists\nif the carrying amount\nof the intangible\nasset is not\nrecoverable and\nexceeds its fair\nvalue. The carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\nnot recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the\nexpected undiscounted\ncash flows.\n\n\u2022 For indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment exists if\nthe carrying amount of\nthe intangible asset\nexceeds its fair\nvalue.\n\n\u2022 Amortizable\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nremaining useful life\nor the finite life\nclassification should\nbe revised. In such\ncases, the remaining\ncarrying amount is\namortized\nprospectively over the\nrevised useful life,\nunless it is\ndetermined that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is indefinite,\nin which case the\nintangible asset is\nnot amortized.\n\n\u2022 Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is no longer\nindefinite; in such\ncases, the carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\namortized\nprospectively over its\nremaining useful life.\n\nThe initial valuation\nof an intangible asset\nas part of the\nacquisition method of\naccounting and the\nsubsequent valuation\nof intangible assets\nas part of an\nimpairment assessment\nare subjective and\nbased, in part, on\ninputs that are\nunobservable and can\nbe subject to\nuncertainty. These\ninputs include, but\nare not limited to,\nforecasted cash flows,\nrevenue growth rates,\ncustomer attrition\nrates and discount\nrates.\n\nFor both goodwill and\nintangible assets, to\nthe extent an\nimpairment loss is\nrecognized, the loss\nestablishes the new\ncost basis of the\nasset. Subsequent\nreversal of impairment\nlosses is not\npermitted. For\namortizable intangible\nassets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized\nover the remaining\nuseful life of that\nasset. Unanticipated\ndeclines in our\nrevenue-generating\ncapability, adverse\nmarket or economic\nevents, and regulatory\nactions, could result\nin material impairment\ncharges in future\nperiods.\n\nSee Notes 2 and 10 to\nthe financial\nstatements for\nadditional information\nabout goodwill and\nintangible assets.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Contingencies          \n                                              \nIn the normal course\nof business, we have\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with our\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\n\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the third-party\nentities that are, or\nwould otherwise be,\nthe primary defendants\nin such cases are\nbankrupt, in financial\ndistress, or may not\nhonor applicable\nindemnification\nobligations. These\nactions have included,\nbut are not limited\nto, antitrust claims,\nclaims under various\nfalse claims act\nstatutes, and matters\narising from our sales\nand trading businesses\nand our activities in\nthe capital markets.\n\nWe are also involved,\nfrom time to time, in\nother reviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding our\nbusiness, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\nfinancing, prime\nbrokerage, market-\nmaking activities,\ninvestment banking\nadvisory services,\ncapital markets\nactivities, financial\nproducts or offerings\nsponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby us, wealth and\ninvestment management\nservices, and\naccounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ndisgorgement,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief.\n\nWe contest liability\nand/or the amount of\ndamages as appropriate\nin each pending\nmatter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand we can reasonably\nestimate the amount of\nthat loss or the range\nof loss, we accrue an\nestimated loss by a\ncharge to income.\n\nIn many legal\nproceedings and\ninvestigations, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where we have\ndetermined that a loss\nis probable or\nreasonably possible,\nor an exposure to loss\nor range of loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, we are\noften unable to\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of the loss\nor range of loss. It\nis particularly\ndifficult to determine\nif a loss is probable\nor reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, where the\nfactual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved in an\ninvestigation or\nproceeding before a\ndetermination can be\nmade that a loss or\nadditional loss (or\n                                 \n  43    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nrange of loss or range\nof additional loss) is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, including\nthrough potentially\nlengthy discovery or\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification,\nthe calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\ndeciding when and if\nto make these\naccruals, and the\nactual cost of a legal\nclaim or regulatory\nfine/penalty may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals.\n\nSee Note 14 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation on legal\ncontingencies.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nWe are subject to the\nincome tax laws of the\nU.S., its states and\nmunicipalities and\nthose of the foreign\njurisdictions in which\nwe have business\noperations. These tax\nlaws are complex and\nsubject to\ninterpretation by the\ntaxpayer and the\nrelevant governmental\ntaxing authorities. We\nmust make judgments\nand interpretations\nabout the application\nof these inherently\ncomplex tax laws and\nmake estimates about\ncertain items\naffecting taxable\nincome when\ndetermining the\nprovision for income\ntaxes in the various\ntax jurisdictions.\n\nDisputes over\ninterpretations of the\ntax laws may be\nsettled with the\ntaxing authority upon\nexamination or audit.\nWe periodically\nevaluate the\nlikelihood of\nassessments in each\ntaxing jurisdiction\nresulting from current\nand subsequent years\u2019\nexaminations, and\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits related to\npotential losses that\nmay arise from tax\naudits are established\nin accordance with the\nrelevant accounting\nguidance. Once\nestablished,\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits are adjusted\nwhen there is more\ninformation available\nor when an event\noccurs requiring a\nchange.\n\nOur provision for\nincome taxes is\ncomposed of current\nand deferred taxes.\nCurrent income taxes\napproximate taxes to\nbe paid or refunded\nfor the current\nperiod. Deferred\nincome taxes reflect\nthe net tax effects of\ntemporary differences\nbetween the financial\nreporting and tax\nbases of assets and\nliabilities and are\nmeasured using the\napplicable enacted tax\nrates and laws that\nwill be in effect when\nsuch differences are\nexpected to reverse.\n\nOur deferred tax\nbalances may also\ninclude deferred\nassets related to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards, such as\nnet operating losses\nand tax credits that\nwill be realized\nthrough reduction of\nfuture tax liabilities\nand, in some cases,\nare subject to\nexpiration if not\nutilized within\ncertain periods. We\nperform regular\nreviews to ascertain\nwhether deferred tax\nassets are realizable.\nThese reviews include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions\nregarding future\ntaxable income and\nincorporate various\ntax-planning\nstrategies, including\n\nstrategies that may be\navailable to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards before\nthey expire.\n\nOnce the deferred tax\nasset balances have\nbeen determined, we\nmay record a valuation\nallowance against the\ndeferred tax asset\nbalances to reflect\nthe amount we estimate\nis more likely than\nnot to be realized at\na future date. Both\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes may\nreflect adjustments\nrelated to our\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\nestimating the\nconsolidated provision\nfor (benefit from)\nincome taxes, current\nand deferred tax\nbalances (including\nvaluation allowance,\nif any), accrued\ninterest or penalties\nand uncertain tax\npositions.

Amounts include loans held for investment,\nnet of ACL, and loans held for sale but\nexclude loans at fair value, which are\nincluded in Trading assets in the balance\nsheet (see Note 9 to the financial\nstatements). 2. Other assets primarily\nincludes premises, equipment and software, ROU\nassets related to leases, other investments\nand deferred tax assets. A substantial portion\nof total assets consists of cash and cash\nequivalents, liquid marketable securities and\nshort-term receivables. In the Institutional\nSecurities business segment, these arise from\nmarket-making, financing and prime brokerage\nactivities, and in the Wealth Management\nbusiness segment, these arise from banking\nactivities, including management of the\ninvestment portfolio. Liquidity Risk\nManagement Framework The primary goal of our\nLiquidity Risk Management Framework is to\nensure that we have access to adequate funding\nacross a wide range of market conditions and\ntime horizons. The framework is designed to\nenable us to fulfill our financial obligations\nand support the execution of our business\nstrategies. The following principles guide our\nLiquidity Risk Management Framework: \u2022\nSufficient liquidity resources, which consist\nof HQLA and cash deposits with banks\n(\u201cLiquidity Resources\u201d) should be maintained\nto cover maturing liabilities and other\nplanned and contingent outflows; \u2022 Maturity\nprofile of assets and liabilities should be\naligned, with limited reliance on short-term\nfunding;\n\n\u2022 Source, counterparty, currency, region and\nterm of funding should be diversified; and \u2022\nLiquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and\naccount for, periods of limited access to\nfunding. The core components of our Liquidity\nRisk Management Framework are the Required\nLiquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests\nand Liquidity Resources, which support our\ntarget liquidity profile. Required Liquidity\nFramework Our Required Liquidity Framework\nestablishes the amount of liquidity we must\nhold in both normal and stressed environments\nto ensure that our financial condition and\noverall soundness are not adversely affected\nby an inability (or perceived inability) to\nmeet our financial obligations in a timely\nmanner. The Required Liquidity Framework\nconsiders the most constraining liquidity\nrequirement to satisfy all regulatory and\ninternal limits at a consolidated and legal\nentity level. Liquidity Stress Tests We use\nLiquidity Stress Tests to model external and\nintercompany liquidity flows across multiple\nscenarios and a range of time horizons. These\nscenarios contain various combinations of\nidiosyncratic and systemic stress events of\ndifferent severity and duration. The\nmethodology, implementation, production and\nanalysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are\nimportant components of the Required Liquidity\nFramework. The assumptions used in our various\nLiquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but\nare not limited to, the following: \u2022 No\ngovernment support; \u2022 No access to equity and\nlimited access to unsecured debt markets; \u2022\nRepayment of all unsecured debt maturing\nwithin the stress horizon; \u2022 Higher haircuts\nfor and significantly lower availability of\nsecured funding; \u2022 Additional collateral that\nwould be required by trading counterparties,\ncertain exchanges and clearing organizations\nrelated to credit rating downgrades; \u2022\nAdditional collateral that would be required\ndue to collateral substitutions, collateral\ndisputes and uncalled collateral; \u2022\nDiscretionary unsecured debt buybacks; \u2022\nDrawdowns on lending commitments provided to\nthird parties; and \u2022 Client cash withdrawals\nand reduction in customer short positions that\nfund long positions. Liquidity Stress Tests\nare produced and results are reported at\ndifferent levels, including major operating\nsubsidiaries and major currencies, to capture\nspecific cash requirements and cash\navailability across the Firm, including a\nlimited number of asset sales in a stressed\nenvironment.

In\naddition to the\nassumptions\nunderpinning the\nLiquidity Stress\nTests, we take into\nconsideration\nsettlement risk\nrelated to intraday\nsettlement and\nclearing of securities\nand financing\nactivities. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we\nmaintained sufficient\nLiquidity Resources to\nmeet current and\ncontingent funding\nobligations as modeled\nin our Liquidity\nStress Tests.\nLiquidity Resources We\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity resources,\nwhich consist of HQLA\nand cash deposits with\nbanks (\u201cLiquidity\nResources\u201d), to cover\ndaily funding needs\nand to meet strategic\nliquidity targets\nsized by the Required\nLiquidity Framework\nand Liquidity Stress\nTests. We actively\nmanage the amount of\nour Liquidity\nResources considering\nthe following\ncomponents: unsecured\ndebt maturity profile;\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition; funding\nneeds in a stressed\nenvironment, inclusive\nof contingent cash\noutflows; legal\nentity, regional and\nsegment liquidity\nrequirements;\nregulatory\nrequirements; and\ncollateral\nrequirements.

In\ndetermining Eligible\nHQLA for LCR purposes,\nweightings (or asset\nhaircuts) are applied\nto HQLA, and certain\nHQLA held in\nsubsidiaries is\nexcluded.

We\npursue a strategy of\ndiversification of\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding sources (by\nproduct, investor and\nregion) and attempt to\nensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities\nequals or exceeds the\nexpected holding\nperiod of the assets\nbeing financed. Our\ngoal is to achieve an\noptimal mix of durable\nsecured and unsecured\nfinancing. We fund our\nbalance sheet on a\nglobal basis through\ndiverse sources. These\nsources include our\nequity capital,\nborrowings, bank\nnotes, securities sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, securities\nlending, deposits,\nletters of credit and\nlines of credit. We\nhave active financing\nprograms for both\nstandard and\nstructured products\ntargeting global\ninvestors and\ncurrencies. Treasury\nallocates interest\nexpense to our\nbusinesses based on\nthe tenor and interest\nrate profile of the\nassets being funded.\nTreasury similarly\nallocates interest\nincome to businesses\ncarrying deposit\nproducts and other\nliabilities across the\nbusinesses based on\nthe characteristics of\nthose deposits and\nother liabilities.\nSecured Financing The\nliquid nature of the\nmarketable securities\nand short-term\nreceivables arising\nprincipally from sales\nand trading activities\nin the Institutional\nSecurities business\nsegment provides us\nwith flexibility in\nmanaging the\ncomposition of our\nbalance sheet. Secured\nfinancing investors\nprincipally focus on\nthe quality of the\neligible collateral\nposted. Accordingly,\nwe actively manage our\nsecured financings\nbased on the quality\nof the assets being\nfunded. We have\nestablished longer-\ntenor secured funding\nrequirements for less\nliquid asset classes,\nfor which funding\n\nmay be at risk in the\nevent of a market\ndisruption. We define\nhighly liquid assets\nas government-issued\nor government-\nguaranteed securities\nwith a high degree of\nfundability and less\nliquid assets as those\nthat do not meet these\ncriteria. To further\nminimize the\nrefinancing risk of\nsecured financing for\nless liquid assets, we\nhave established\nconcentration limits\nto diversify our\ninvestor base and\nreduce the amount of\nmonthly maturities for\nsecured financing of\nless liquid assets. As\na component of the\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework,\nwe hold a portion of\nour Liquidity\nResources against the\npotential disruption\nto our secured\nfinancing\ncapabilities.

Regulatory Requirements\nRegulatory Capital Framework We are an FHC\nunder the BHC Act and are subject to the\nregulation and oversight of the Federal\nReserve. The Federal Reserve establishes\ncapital requirements for us, including \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards, and evaluates our\ncompliance with such capital requirements. The\nOCC establishes similar capital requirements\nand standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.\nThe regulatory capital requirements are\nlargely based on the Basel III capital\nstandards established by the Basel Committee\nand also implement certain provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we\nmust remain well-capitalized in accordance\nwith standards established by the Federal\nReserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must\nremain well-capitalized in accordance with\nstandards established by the OCC. In addition,\nmany of our regulated subsidiaries are subject\nto regulatory capital requirements, including\nregulated subsidiaries registered as swap\ndealers with the CFTC or conditionally\nregistered as security-based swap dealers with\nthe SEC or registered as broker-dealers or\nfutures commission merchants. For additional\ninformation on regulatory capital requirements\nfor our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our\nsubsidiaries that are swap entities, see Note\n16 to the financial statements. Regulatory\nCapital Requirements We are required to\nmaintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based\ncapital and TLAC ratios. For additional\ninformation on TLAC, see \u201cTotal Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding\nCompany Requirements\u201d herein. Risk-Based\nRegulatory Capital .

Required ratios represent the regulatory\nminimum plus the capital buffer requirement.\nRisk-Weighted Assets. RWA reflects both our\non- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as\ncapital charges attributable to the risk of\nloss arising from the following: \u2022 Credit\nrisk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty\nor issuer to meet its financial obligations to\nus; \u2022 Market risk: Adverse changes in the\nlevel of one or more market prices, rates,\nspreads, indices, volatilities,\n\ncorrelations or other market factors, such as\nmarket liquidity; and \u2022 Operational risk:\nInadequate or failed processes or systems,\nfrom human factors or from external events (\ne.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance\nrisks, cyber attacks or damage to physical\nassets). Our risk-based capital ratios are\ncomputed under each of (i) the Standardized\nApproach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The\ncredit risk RWA calculations between the two\napproaches differ in that the Standardized\nApproach requires calculation of RWA using\nprescribed risk weights and exposure\nmethodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach\nutilizes models to calculate exposure amounts\nand risk weights. At December 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the differences between the\nactual and required ratios were lower under\nthe Standardized Approach. Leverage-Based\nRegulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital\nrequirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage\nratio of 4%, a minimum SLR of 3% and an\nenhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%.\nCECL Deferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020,\nwe elected to defer the effect of the adoption\nof CECL on our risk-based and leverage-based\ncapital amounts and ratios, as well as our\nRWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary\nleverage exposure calculations, over a five-\nyear transition period. The deferral impacts\nbegan to phase in at 25% per year from January\n1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January\n1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully\nphased-in from January 1, 2025.\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    50  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nRegulatory Capital\nRatios Risk-based\ncapital\n                                              \n         S\u2026                   A\u2026              \n         At        \u2026          At        \u2026     \n         D\u2026        \u2026          D\u2026        \u2026     \n         3\u2026        \u2026          3\u2026        \u2026     \n         2\u2026        \u2026          2\u2026        \u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $  7\u2026     $  \u2026       $  7\u2026     $  \u2026     \n         8\u2026        \u2026          8\u2026        \u2026     \n         9\u2026        \u2026          9\u2026        \u2026     \n         4\u2026        \u2026          4\u2026        \u2026     \n                                              \n         1\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n         1\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n         2\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n                                              \n         1\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n         1\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n         1\u2026  %     \u2026  %       1\u2026  %     \u2026  %  \n                                              \n1.

and\nAdvanced Approaches. Under the Standardized\nApproach, the increase was primarily due to\nhigher Securities financing transactions,\ngrowth in Corporate lending, as well as an\nincrease in Other credit risk driven by\nsecuritizations. These increases were\npartially offset by decreased exposure in\nderivatives. Under the Advanced Approach, the\nincrease was primarily due to growth in\nCorporate lending, increase in Derivatives\ndriven by counterparty credit risk, and higher\nSecurities financing transactions. These\nincreases were partially offset by decreased\nexposure in investment securities. Market risk\nRWA increased in 2024 under both the\nStandardized and Advanced Approaches,\nprimarily driven by higher charges on Specific\nrisk and Incremental risk due to increased\nexposures. The increase in Operational risk\nRWA in 2024 is related to legal expenses and\nexecution losses. G-SIB Capital Surcharge We\nand other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to an\nadditional risk-based capital surcharge, the\nG-SIB capital surcharge, which must be\nsatisfied using CET1 capital and which\nfunctions as an extension of the capital\nconservation buffer. The surcharge is\ncalculated based on the G-SIB\u2019s size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, and complexity and\n\nsubstitutability (\u201cMethod 1\u201d) or use of short-\nterm wholesale funding (\u201cMethod 2\u201d), whichever\nis higher. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity,\nLong-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company\nRequirements The Federal Reserve has\nestablished external TLAC, long-term debt\n(\u201cLTD\u201d) and clean holding company requirements\nfor top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (\u201ccovered\nBHCs\u201d), including the Parent Company. These\nrequirements are designed to ensure that\ncovered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point of failure to be\nrecapitalized through the conversion of\neligible LTD to equity or otherwise by\nimposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms\nof TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is\nused (see \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u2014Financial Holding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance\nRisk\u201d). These TLAC and eligible LTD\nrequirements include various restrictions,\nsuch as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued\nby the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a\nmaturity of one year or more from the date of\nissuance; and not contain certain embedded\nfeatures, such as a principal or redemption\namount subject to reduction based on the\nperformance of an asset, entity or index, or a\nsimilar feature. In addition, the requirements\nprovide permanent grandfathering for debt\ninstruments issued prior to December 31, 2016\nthat would be eligible LTD but for having\nimpermissible acceleration clauses or being\ngoverned by foreign law. A covered BHC is also\nrequired to maintain minimum external TLAC\nequal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA\nor (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure\n(the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs\nmust also meet a minimum external LTD\nrequirement equal to the greater of (i) total\nRWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the\nhigher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB\ncapital surcharge applicable to the Parent\nCompany or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage\nexposure. TLAC buffer requirements are imposed\non top of both the risk-based and leverage\nexposure-based external TLAC minimum\nrequirements.

External TLAC consists of CET1\ncapital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each\nexcluding any noncontrolling minority\ninterests), as well as eligible LTD. 3.\nConsists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50%\nfor amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid\nin more than one year but less than two years\nfrom each respective balance sheet date.\nFurthermore, under the clean holding company\nrequirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from\nincurring any external debt with an original\nmaturity of less than one year or certain\nother liabilities, regardless of whether the\nliabilities are fully secured or otherwise\nsenior to eligible LTD, or entering into\ncertain other prohibited transactions. Certain\nother external liabilities, including those\nwith certain embedded features noted above,\nare subject to a cap equal to 5% of the\ncovered BHC\u2019s outstanding external TLAC\namount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to\nmake certain deductions from regulatory\ncapital for investments in certain unsecured\ndebt instruments (including eligible LTD in\nthe TLAC framework) issued by the Parent\nCompany or other G-SIBs. We are in compliance\nwith all TLAC requirements as of December 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023. Capital Plans,\nStress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer The\nFederal Reserve has capital planning and\nstress test requirements for large BHCs, which\nform part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR\nframework. We must submit, on at least an\nannual basis, a capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate annual stress tests designed by us\nand the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal\nReserve may assess our systems and processes\nthat incorporate forward-looking projections\nof revenues and losses to monitor and maintain\nour internal capital adequacy. As banks with\nless than $250 billion of total assets, our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to\ncompany-run stress test regulatory\nrequirements. The capital plan must include a\ndescription of all planned capital actions\nover a nine-quarter planning horizon,\nincluding any issuance or redemption of a debt\nor equity capital instrument, any capital\ndistribution (i.e . , payments of dividends or\nstock repurchases) and any similar action that\nthe Federal Reserve determines could impact\nour consolidated capital. The capital plan\nmust include a discussion of how we\n\nwill maintain capital above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios and how we will\nserve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries under supervisory stress\nscenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve\nhas issued guidance setting out its heightened\nexpectations for capital planning practices at\ncertain large financial institutions,\nincluding us. As part of its annual capital\nsupervisory stress testing process, the\nFederal Reserve determines an SCB for each\nlarge BHC, including us. The SCB applies only\nwith respect to Standardized Approach risk-\nbased capital requirements and replaced the\nCET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The\nSCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline\nin our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nunder the severely adverse scenario over the\nsupervisory stress test measurement period\nplus the sum of the four quarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends divided by the\nprojected RWAs from the quarter in which the\nFirm\u2019s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory\nstress test and (ii) 2.5%. The supervisory\nstress test assumes that BHCs generally\nmaintain a constant level of assets and RWAs\nthroughout the projection period. A firm\u2019s SCB\nis subject to revision each year, taking\neffect from October 1 to reflect the results\nof the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual supervisory\nstress test. The Federal Reserve has\ndiscretion to recalculate a firm\u2019s SCB outside\nof the October 1 annual cycle and to require\napproval for certain actions, in some\ncircumstances. The Federal Reserve also has\nthe authority to impose restrictions on\ncapital actions as a supervisory matter. For\nthe 2024 capital planning and stress test\ncycle, we submitted our capital plan and\ncompany-run stress test results to the Federal\nReserve on April 5, 2024. On June 26, 2024,\nthe Federal Reserve published summary results\nof its supervisory stress tests of each large\nBHC, in which the projected decline in our\nCET1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario\nincreased from the prior annual supervisory\nstress test by 50 basis points, from 4.1% to\n4.6%. Following the publication of the\nsupervisory stress test results, we announced\nthat our SCB will be 6.0% from October 1, 2024\nthrough September 30, 2025. In addition to the\nprojected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1\nratio in the severely adverse scenario, our\nSCB reflects the increase in our common stock\ndividend in the dividend add-on. Together with\nother features of the regulatory capital\nframework, this SCB results in an aggregate\nStandardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1\nratio of 13.5%. Generally, our SCB is\ndetermined annually based on the results of\nthe supervisory stress test. We also disclosed\na summary of the results of our company-run\nstress tests on our Investor Relations website\nand increased our quarterly common stock\ndividend to $0.925 per share from $0.85,\nbeginning with the common stock dividend\nannounced on July 16, 2024.\n                                 \n  53    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAttribution of Average\nCommon Equity\nAccording to the\nRequired Capital\nFramework Our required\ncapital (\u201cRequired\nCapital\u201d) estimation\nis based on the\nRequired Capital\nframework, an internal\ncapital adequacy\nmeasure. Common equity\nattribution to the\nbusiness segments is\nbased on capital usage\ncalculated under the\nRequired Capital\nframework, as well as\neach business\nsegment\u2019s relative\ncontribution to our\ntotal Required\nCapital. The Required\nCapital framework is a\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nmeasure, which is\ncompared with our\nregulatory capital to\nensure that we\nmaintain an amount of\ngoing concern capital\nafter absorbing\npotential losses from\nstress events, where\napplicable, at a point\nin time. The amount of\ncapital allocated to\nthe business segments\nis generally set at\nthe beginning of each\nyear and remains fixed\nthroughout the year\nuntil the next annual\nreset unless a\nsignificant business\nchange occurs (e.g . ,\nacquisition or\ndisposition).

Resolution and\nRecovery Planning We are required to submit\nonce every two years to the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC (\u201cAgencies\u201d) a resolution plan\nthat describes our strategy for a rapid and\norderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode in the event of our material financial\ndistress or failure. We submitted our 2023\nfull resolution plan on June 30, 2023. In June\n2024, we received joint feedback on our 2023\nresolution plan from the Agencies, with no\nshortcomings or deficiencies identified. Our\nnext resolution plan submission will be a\ntargeted resolution plan in July 2025. For\nmore information about resolution planning\nrequirements, see \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u2014Financial Holding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning.\u201d As\ndescribed in our most recent resolution plan,\nour preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE\nstrategy. In line with our\n\nSPOE strategy, the Parent Company has\ntransferred, and has agreed to transfer on an\nongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly\nowned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley\nHoldings LLC (the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition,\nthe Parent Company has entered into an amended\nand restated support agreement with its\nmaterial entities (including the Funding IHC)\nand certain other subsidiaries. In the event\nof a resolution scenario, the Parent Company\nwould be obligated to contribute all of its\ncontributable assets to our supported entities\nand/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would\nbe obligated to provide capital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our supported entities. The\ncombined implication of the SPOE resolution\nstrategy and the requirement to maintain\ncertain levels of TLAC is that losses in\nresolution would be imposed on the holders of\neligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent Company before any losses\nare imposed on creditors of our supported\nentities and without requiring taxpayer or\ngovernment financial support. The obligations\nof the Parent Company and the Funding IHC\nunder the amended and restated support\nagreement are in most cases secured on a\nsenior basis by the assets of the Parent\nCompany (other than shares in subsidiaries of\nthe Parent Company and certain other assets)\nand the assets of the Funding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our supported entities,\nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the\nsecured assets, are effectively senior to\nunsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\nFor more information about resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements and our\nactivities in these areas, including the\nimplications of such activities in a\nresolution scenario, see \u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation\u2014Financial Holding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and Recovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory and Compliance\nRisk.\u201d Regulatory Developments and Other\nMatters Basel III Endgame and G-SIB Surcharge\nProposals On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking\nagencies proposed revisions to risk-based\ncapital and related standards applicable to us\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries (\u201cBasel III\nEndgame Proposal\u201d).

We\nbelieve effective risk\nmanagement is vital to\nthe success of our\nbusiness activities.\nAccordingly, we have\nan Enterprise Risk\nManagement (\u201cERM\u201d)\nframework to integrate\nthe diverse roles of\nrisk management into a\nholistic enterprise\nstructure and to\nfacilitate the\nincorporation of risk\nassessment into\ndecision-making\nprocesses across the\nFirm.\n\nWe have policies and\nprocedures in place to\nidentify, measure,\nmonitor, escalate,\nmitigate and control\nthe principal risks\ninvolved in the\nactivities of the\nInstitutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments,\nsignificant operating\nsubsidiaries, as well\nas at the Parent\nCompany level.

This\nphilosophy is\nimplemented through\nthe ERM framework.\nFive key principles\nunderlie this\nphilosophy: integrity,\ncomprehensiveness,\nindependence,\naccountability and\ntransparency. To help\nensure the efficacy of\nrisk management, which\nis an essential\ncomponent of our\nreputation, senior\n\nmanagement requires\nthorough and frequent\nreporting and the\nappropriate escalation\nof risk matters. The\nfast-paced, complex\nand constantly\nevolving nature of\nglobal financial\nmarkets requires us to\nmaintain a risk\nmanagement culture\nthat is incisive,\nknowledgeable about\nspecialized products\nand markets, and\nsubject to ongoing\nreview and\nenhancement.\n\nOur risk appetite\ndefines the aggregate\nlevel and types of\nrisk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept to\nachieve its business\nobjectives, taking\ninto account the\ninterests of clients\nand fiduciary duties\nto shareholders, as\nwell as capital and\nother regulatory\nrequirements. This\nrisk appetite is\nembedded in our risk\nculture and linked to\nour short-term and\nlong-term strategic,\ncapital and financial\nplans, as well as\ncompensation programs.\nThis risk appetite and\nthe related Board-\nlevel risk limits and\nrisk tolerance\nstatements are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Risk Committee\nof the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d)\nand the Board on at\nleast an annual basis.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance Structure                   \n                                              \nRisk management at the\nFirm requires\nindependent Firm-level\noversight,\naccountability of our\nbusiness segments and\neffective\ncommunication of risk\nmatters across the\nFirm, to senior\nmanagement and\nultimately to the\nBoard.

Every\nnew hire and every\nemployee annually is\nrequired to certify to\ntheir understanding of\nand adherence to the\nCode of Conduct. The\nFirm\u2019s Global Conduct\nRisk Management Policy\nalso sets out a\nconsistent global\nframework for managing\nconduct risk (i.e.,\nthe risk arising from\nmisconduct by\nemployees or\ncontingent workers)\nand conduct risk\nincidents at the Firm.\n\nThe employee annual\nperformance review\nprocess includes\nevaluation of employee\nconduct related to\nrisk management\npractices and the\nFirm\u2019s expectations.\nWe also have several\nmutually reinforcing\nprocesses to identify\nemployee conduct that\nmay have an impact on\nemployment status,\ncurrent-year\ncompensation and/or\nprior-year\ncompensation. For\nexample, the Global\nIncentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy sets\nforth standards for\nmanagers when making\nannual compensation\ndecisions and\nspecifically provides\nthat managers must\nconsider whether their\nemployees effectively\nmanaged and/or\nsupervised risk\ncontrol practices\nduring the performance\nyear.

However,\nthe analyses used to\nassess such risks are\nnot predictions of\nfuture events, and\nactual results may\nvary significantly\nfrom such analyses due\nto events in the\nmarkets in which we\noperate and certain\nother factors\ndescribed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk refers to\nthe risk that a change\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, spreads,\nindices, volatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity,\nwill result in losses\nfor a position or\nportfolio. Generally,\nwe incur market risk\nas a result of\ntrading, investing and\nclient facilitation\nactivities,\nprincipally within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment where the\nsubstantial majority\nof our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is\ngenerated. In\naddition, we incur\nnon-trading market\nrisk, principally\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments. The\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\n(including interest\nrate risk) from\nlending and deposit-\ntaking activities. The\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\nfrom capital\ninvestments in its\nfunds.\n\nMarket risk also\nincludes non-trading\ninterest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest\nrate risk in the\nbanking book (amounts\nclassified for\nregulatory capital\npurposes under the\nbanking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure\nthat a change in\ninterest rates will\nresult in prospective\nearnings and fair\nvalue changes for\nassets and liabilities\nin the banking book.\n\nSound market risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nculture. The various\nbusiness units and\ntrading desks are\nresponsible for\nensuring that market\nrisk exposures are\nwell-managed and\nprudent. The Firm\u2019s\ncontrol functions help\nensure that these\nrisks are measured and\nclosely monitored and\nare made transparent\nto senior management.\nThe Market Risk\nDepartment is\nresponsible for\nensuring the\ntransparency of\nmaterial market risks,\nmonitoring compliance\nwith established\nlimits and escalating\nrisk concentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nMarket Risk Department\nmonitors our risk\nagainst limits on\naggregate risk\nexposures, performs a\nvariety of risk\nanalyses, routinely\nreports risk\nsummaries, and\nmaintains our VaR and\nscenario analysis\nsystems.

Commodity\nexposures are subject\nto periods of high\nprice volatility as a\nresult of changes in\nsupply and demand.\nThese changes can be\ncaused by weather\nconditions, physical\nproduction and\ntransportation, or\ngeopolitical and other\nevents that affect the\navailable supply and\nlevel of demand for\nthese commodities.\n\nWe manage our trading\npositions by employing\na variety of risk-\nmitigation strategies.\nThese strategies\ninclude\ndiversification of\nrisk exposures and\nhedging. Hedging\nactivities consist of\nthe purchase or sale\nof positions in\nrelated\n\nsecurities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products\n(e.g., futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).

The Market\nRisk Department\ncalculates and\ndistributes daily VaR-\nbased risk measures to\nvarious levels of\nmanagement.\n\nWe estimate VaR using\na model based on a\none-year equal-\nweighted historical\nsimulation for general\nmarket risk factors\nand name-specific risk\nin corporate equities\nand related\nderivatives, and Monte\nCarlo simulation for\nname-specific risk in\nbonds, loans and\nrelated derivatives.\nThe model constructs a\ndistribution of\nhypothetical daily\nchanges in the value\nof trading portfolios\nbased on historical\nobservation of daily\nchanges in key market\nindices or other\nmarket risk factors,\nand information on the\nsensitivity of the\nportfolio values to\nthese market risk\nfactor changes.\n\nVaR for risk\nmanagement purposes\n(\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95%\nlevel of confidence\nover a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a\nuseful indicator of\npossible trading\nlosses resulting from\nadverse daily market\nmoves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the\nunrealized loss in\nportfolio value that,\nbased on historically\nobserved market risk\nfactor movements,\nwould have been\nexceeded with a\nfrequency of 5%, or\nfive times in every\n100 trading days, if\nthe portfolio were\nheld constant for one\nday.\n\nOur VaR model\ngenerally takes into\naccount linear and\nnon-linear exposures\nto equity and\ncommodity price risk,\ninterest rate risk,\ncredit spread risk and\nforeign exchange\nrates. The model also\ntakes into account\nlinear exposures to\nimplied volatility\nrisks for all asset\nclasses and non-linear\nexposures to implied\nvolatility risks for\nequity, commodity and\nforeign\n                                 \n  59    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nexchange referenced\nproducts. The VaR\nmodel also captures\ncertain implied\ncorrelation risks\nassociated with\nportfolio credit\nderivatives, as well\nas certain basis risks\n(e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit\nderivatives). We use\nVaR as one of a range\nof risk management\ntools. Among their\nbenefits, VaR models\npermit estimation of a\nportfolio\u2019s aggregate\nmarket risk exposure,\nincorporating a range\nof varied market risks\nand portfolio assets.\nOne key element of the\nVaR model is that it\nreflects risk\nreduction due to\nportfolio\ndiversification or\nhedging activities.\nHowever, VaR has\nvarious limitations,\nwhich include, but are\nnot limited to: use of\nhistorical changes in\nmarket risk factors,\nwhich may not be\naccurate predictors of\nfuture market\nconditions and may not\nfully incorporate the\nrisk of extreme market\nevents that are\noutsized relative to\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior or\nreflect the historical\ndistribution of\nresults beyond the 95%\nconfidence interval;\nand reporting of\nlosses in a single\nday, which does not\nreflect the risk of\npositions that cannot\nbe liquidated or\nhedged in one day. A\nsmall proportion of\nmarket risk generated\nby trading positions\nis not included in\nVaR. The modeling of\nthe risk\ncharacteristics of\nsome positions relies\non approximations\nthat, under certain\ncircumstances, could\nproduce significantly\ndifferent results from\nthose produced using\nmore precise measures.\nVaR is most\nappropriate as a risk\nmeasure for trading\npositions in liquid\nfinancial markets and\nwill understate the\nrisk associated with\nsevere events, such as\nperiods of extreme\nilliquidity. We are\naware of these and\nother limitations and,\ntherefore, use VaR as\nonly one component in\nour risk management\noversight process.\nThis process also\nincorporates stress\ntesting and scenario\nanalyses and extensive\nrisk monitoring,\nanalysis and control\nat the trading desk,\ndivision and Firm\nlevels. We update our\nVaR model in response\nto changes in the\ncomposition of trading\nportfolios and to\nimprovements in\nmodeling techniques\nand systems\ncapabilities. We are\ncommitted to\ncontinuous review and\nenhancement of VaR\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in order\nto capture evolving\nrisks associated with\nchanges in market\nstructure and\ndynamics. As part of\nour regular process\nimprovements,\nadditional systematic\nand name-specific risk\nfactors may be added\nto improve the VaR\nmodel\u2019s ability to\nmore accurately\nestimate risks to\nspecific asset classes\nor industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR\nstatistics are\nestimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR\nshould not be viewed\nas predictive of our\nfuture revenues or\nfinancial performance\nor of our ability to\nmonitor and manage\nrisk. There can be no\nassurance that our\nactual losses on a\nparticular day will\nnot exceed the VaR\namounts indicated in\nthe following tables\nor that such losses\nwill not occur more\nthan five times in 100\ntrading days for a\n95%/one-day VaR. VaR\ndoes not predict the\nmagnitude of losses\nthat, should they\noccur, may be\nsignificantly greater\nthan the VaR amount.\n\nVaR statistics are not\nreadily comparable\nacross firms because\nof differences in the\nfirms\u2019 portfolios,\nmodeling assumptions\nand methodologies.\nThese differences can\nresult in materially\ndifferent VaR\nestimates across firms\nfor similar\nportfolios. The impact\nof such differences\nvaries depending on\nthe factor history\nassumptions, the\nfrequency with which\nthe factor history is\nupdated and the\nconfidence level. As a\nresult, VaR statistics\nare more useful when\ninterpreted as\nindicators of trends\nin a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile rather than as\nan absolute measure of\nrisk to be compared\nacross firms. Our\nregulators have\napproved the same VaR\nmodel we use for risk\nmanagement purposes\nfor use in regulatory\ncalculations. The\nportfolio of positions\nused for Management\nVaR differs from that\nused for Regulatory\nVaR.

The prior period\nhas been revised to\nconform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nThe previous table\npresents an analysis\nof selected\ninstantaneous upward\nand downward parallel\ninterest rate shocks\n(subject to a floor of\nzero percent in the\ndownward scenario) on\nnet interest income\nover the next 12\nmonths for our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment. These shocks\nare applied to our\n12-month forecast for\nour Wealth Management\nbusiness segment,\nwhich incorporates\nmarket expectations of\ninterest rates and our\nforecasted balance\nsheet and business\nactivity. The forecast\nincludes modeled\nprepayment behavior,\nreinvestment of net\ncash flows from\nmaturing assets and\nliabilities, and\ndeposit pricing\nsensitivity to\ninterest rates. These\nkey assumptions are\nupdated periodically\nbased on historical\ndata and future\nexpectations. We do\nnot manage to any\nsingle rate scenario\nbut rather manage net\ninterest income in our\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nacross a range of\npossible outcomes,\nincluding non-parallel\nrate change scenarios.\nThe sensitivity\nanalysis assumes that\nwe take no action in\nresponse to these\nscenarios, assumes\nthere are no changes\nin other macroeconomic\nvariables normally\ncorrelated with\nchanges in interest\nrates and includes\nsubjective assumptions\nregarding customer and\nmarket re-pricing\nbehavior and other\nfactors.

The market risk related to these\ninvestments is measured by estimating the\npotential reduction in net revenues associated\nwith a reasonably possible 10% decline in\ninvestment values and related impact on\nperformance-based income, as applicable.\nInvestment sensitivity changed between\nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nprimarily due to new investments in the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act affordable housing\nand new private credit funds in Investment\nManagement. Asset Management Revenue\nSensitivity Certain asset management revenues\nin the Wealth Management and Investment\nManagement business segments are derived from\nmanagement fees, which are based on fee-based\nclient assets in Wealth Management or AUM in\nInvestment Management (together, \u201cclient\nholdings\u201d). The assets underlying client\nholdings are primarily composed of equity,\nfixed income and alternative investments and\nare sensitive to changes in related markets.\nThese revenues depend on multiple factors\nincluding, but not limited to, the level and\nduration of a market increase or decline,\nprice volatility, the geographic and industry\nmix of client assets, and client behavior such\nas the rate and magnitude of client\ninvestments and redemptions. Therefore,\noverall revenues may not correlate completely\nwith changes in the related markets. Credit\nRisk Credit risk refers to the risk of loss\narising when a borrower, counterparty or\nissuer does not meet its financial obligations\nto us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk\nfrom institutions and individuals through our\nInstitutional Securities and Wealth Management\nbusiness segments.\n\nWe incur credit risk in our Institutional\nSecurities business segment through a variety\nof activities, including, but not limited to,\nthe following: \u2022 extending credit to clients\nthrough loans and lending commitments; \u2022\nentering into swap or other derivative\ncontracts under which counterparties may have\nobligations to make payments to us; \u2022 acting\nas clearing broker for listed and over-the-\ncounter derivatives whereby we guarantee\nclient performance to clearinghouses; \u2022\nproviding short- or long-term funding that is\nsecured by physical or financial collateral,\nincluding, but not limited to, real estate and\nmarketable securities, whose value may at\ntimes be insufficient to fully cover the\nrepayment amount; \u2022 posting margin and/or\ncollateral to clearinghouses, clearing\nagencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms\nand other financial counterparties; \u2022 placing\nfunds on deposit at other financial\ninstitutions to support our clearing and\nsettlement obligations; and \u2022 investing or\ntrading in securities and loan pools, whereby\nthe value of these assets may fluctuate based\non realized or expected defaults on the\nunderlying obligations or loans. We incur\ncredit risk in our Wealth Management business\nsegment, primarily through lending to\nindividuals and entities, including, but not\nlimited to, the following: \u2022 margin loans\ncollateralized by securities; \u2022 securities-\nbased lending and other forms of secured\nloans, including tailored lending to ultra-\nhigh net worth clients, that are in most cases\nsecured by various types of collateral,\nincluding marketable securities, private\ninvestments, commercial real estate and other\nfinancial assets; \u2022 single-family residential\nmortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming\nor HELOC form, primarily to existing Wealth\nManagement clients; and \u2022 employee loans\ngranted primarily to recruit certain Wealth\nManagement representatives. Monitoring and\nControl The Credit Risk Management Department\n(\u201cCRM\u201d) establishes Firmwide practices to\nevaluate, monitor and control credit risk at\nthe transaction, obligor and portfolio levels.\nThe CRM approves extensions of credit,\nevaluates the creditworthiness of the\ncounterparties and borrowers on a regular\nbasis, and helps ensure that credit exposure\nis actively monitored and managed. The\nevaluation of counterparties and borrowers\nincludes an assessment of the probability that\nan obligor will default on its financial\nobligations and any losses that may occur when\nan obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk\nexposure is actively managed by credit\nprofessionals and committees within the CRM\nand through various risk committees, whose\nmembership includes individuals from the CRM.\nA comprehensive and global Credit Limits\nFramework is utilized to manage credit risk\nlevels across the Firm. The Credit Limits\nFramework is calibrated within our risk\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    62  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \ntolerance and includes\nsingle-name limits and\nportfolio\nconcentration limits\nby country, industry\nand product type. The\nCRM helps ensure\ntimely and transparent\ncommunication of\nmaterial credit risks,\ncompliance with\nestablished limits and\nescalation of risk\nconcentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement. The CRM\nalso works closely\nwith the Market Risk\nDepartment and\napplicable business\nunits to monitor risk\nexposures and to\nperform stress tests\nto identify, analyze\nand control credit\nrisk concentrations\narising from lending\nand trading\nactivities. The stress\ntests shock market\nfactors (e.g . ,\ninterest rates,\ncommodity prices,\ncredit spreads), risk\nparameters (e.g. ,\nprobability of default\nand loss given\ndefault), recovery\nrates and expected\nlosses in order to\nassess the impact of\nstresses on exposures,\nprofit and loss, and\nour capital position.\nStress tests are\nconducted in\naccordance with our\nestablished policies\nand procedures. Credit\nEvaluation The\nevaluation of\ncorporate and\ninstitutional\ncounterparties and\nborrowers includes\nassigning credit\nratings, which reflect\nan assessment of an\nobligor\u2019s probability\nof default and loss\ngiven default. Credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the assessment\nof financial\nstatements; leverage;\nliquidity; capital\nstrength; asset\ncomposition and\nquality; market\ncapitalization; access\nto capital markets;\nadequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable; and, in\nthe case of certain\nloans, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements.\nThe CRM also evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, exposure to\nchanges in\ninternational trade\npolicies and supply\nchain constraints,\nmanagement and other\nfactors such as\ncountry risks and\nlegal and contingent\nrisks that could\naffect the obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile.\nAdditionally, the CRM\nevaluates the relative\nposition of our\nexposure in the\nborrower\u2019s capital\nstructure and relative\nrecovery prospects, as\nwell as other\nstructural elements of\nthe particular\ntransaction. The\nunderwriting of\ncommercial real estate\nloans includes, but is\nnot limited to, review\nof the property type,\nLTV ratio, occupancy\nlevels, debt service\nratio, prevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\nThe evaluation of\nconsumer borrowers is\ntailored to the\nspecific type of\nlending. Securities-\nbased loans are\nevaluated based on\nfactors that include,\nbut are not limited\nto, the amount of the\nloan and the amount,\nquality,\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. The\nunderwriting of\nresidential real\nestate loans includes,\nbut is not limited to,\nreview of the\nobligor\u2019s debt-to-\nincome ratio, net\nworth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand industry standard\ncredit-scoring models\n(e.g., FICO scores).\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nindividual loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level, and\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis. Credit\nrisk metrics assigned\nto our borrowers\nduring the evaluation\nprocess are\nincorporated into the\nCRM maintenance of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Such allowance\nserves as a reserve\nfor expected inherent\nlosses, as well as\nexpected losses\nrelated to loans\nidentified as\nimpaired.\n\nFor more information\non the allowance for\ncredit losses, see\nNotes 2 and 9 to the\nfinancial statements.\nRisk Mitigation We may\nseek to mitigate\ncredit risk from our\nlending and trading\nactivities in multiple\nways, including\ncollateral provisions,\nguarantees and hedges.\nAt the transaction\nlevel, we seek to\nmitigate risk through\nmanagement of key risk\nelements such as size,\ntenor, financial\ncovenants, seniority\nand collateral. We\nactively hedge our\nlending and\nderivatives exposures.\nHedging activities\nconsist of the\npurchase, sale or\ntransfer of positions\nin related securities\nand financial\ninstruments, including\na variety of\nderivative products\n(e.g., futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).\nAdditionally, we may\nsell, assign or\nsyndicate loans and\nlending commitments to\nother financial\ninstitutions in the\nprimary and secondary\nloan markets. In\nconnection with our\nderivatives trading\nactivities, we\ngenerally enter into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral\narrangements with\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide us\nwith the ability to\ndemand collateral, as\nwell as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset\nreceivables and\npayables covered under\nthe same master\nagreement in the event\nof a counterparty\ndefault. A collateral\nmanagement group\nmonitors collateral\nlevels against\nrequirements and\noversees the\nadministration of the\ncollateral function.\nSee Note 8 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\ntransactions.

Loans\nheld at fair value are\nthe result of the\nconsolidation of\ninvestment vehicles\n(including CLOs)\nmanaged by Investment\nManagement, composed\nprimarily of senior\nsecured loans to\ncorporations. 3.\nLending commitments\nrepresent the notional\namount of legally\nbinding obligations to\nprovide funding to\nclients for lending\ntransactions. Since\ncommitments associated\nwith these business\nactivities may expire\nunused or may not be\nutilized to full\ncapacity, they do not\nnecessarily reflect\nthe actual future cash\nfunding requirements.\nWe provide loans and\nlending commitments to\na variety of\ncustomers, including\nlarge corporate and\ninstitutional clients,\nas well as high to\nultra-high net worth\nindividuals. In\naddition, we purchase\nloans in the secondary\nmarket. Loans and\nlending commitments\nare either held for\ninvestment, held for\nsale or carried at\nfair value. For more\ninformation on these\nloan classifications,\nsee Note 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\nIn 2024, total loans\nand lending\ncommitments increased\nby approximately $47\nbillion, primarily due\nto an increase in\nCorporate lending\ncommitments and\nSecured lending\nfacilities within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, and growth\nacross portfolios\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.

The\nallowance for credit\nlosses for loans and\nlending commitments\nwas relatively\nunchanged since\nDecember 31, 2023,\nreflecting provisions\nfor certain specific\ncommercial real estate\nloans and growth in\nthe corporate loan\nportfolio, offset by\ncharge-offs related to\ncommercial real estate\nlending, mainly in the\noffice sector, and\nimprovements in the\nmacroeconomic outlook.\nThe base scenario used\nin our ACL models as\nof December 31, 2024\nwas generated using a\ncombination of\nconsensus economic\nforecasts, forward\nrates, and internally\ndeveloped and\nvalidated models.

and\nResidential real\nestate loans.\nSecurities-based\nlending allows clients\nto borrow money\nagainst the value of\nqualifying securities,\ngenerally for any\npurpose other than\npurchasing, trading or\ncarrying securities or\nrefinancing margin\ndebt. We establish\napproved credit lines\nagainst qualifying\nsecurities and monitor\nlimits daily and,\npursuant to such\nguidelines, require\ncustomers to deposit\nadditional collateral,\nor reduce debt\npositions, when\nnecessary. These\ncredit lines are\nprimarily uncommitted\nloan facilities, as we\nreserve the right not\nto make any advances\nor may terminate these\ncredit lines at any\ntime. Factors\nconsidered in the\nreview of these loans\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the loan\namount, the client\u2019s\ncredit profile, the\ndegree of leverage,\ncollateral\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. Other\nloans primarily\ninclude tailored\nlending, which\ntypically consist of\nbespoke lending\narrangements provided\nto ultra-high net\nworth clients.\nSecurities-based\nlending and Other\nloans are generally\nsecured by various\ntypes of eligible\ncollateral, including\nmarketable securities,\nprivate investments,\ncommercial real estate\nand other financial\nassets. Residential\nreal estate loans\nconsist of first- and\nsecond-lien mortgages,\nincluding HELOCs. Our\nunderwriting policy is\ndesigned to ensure\nthat all borrowers\npass an assessment of\ncapacity and\nwillingness to pay,\nwhich includes an\nanalysis utilizing\nindustry standard\ncredit scoring models\n(e.g., FICO scores),\ndebt-to-income ratios\nand assets of the\nborrower. Mortgage\nborrowers are required\nto maintain adequate\ninsurance in\naccordance with loan\nterms. LTV ratios are\ndetermined based on\nindependent third-\nparty property\nappraisals and\nvaluations, and\nsecurity lien\npositions are\nestablished through\ntitle and ownership\nreports. The vast\nmajority of mortgage\nloans, including\nHELOCs, are held for\ninvestment in the\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\u2019s\nloan portfolio.\n                                 \n  67    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nWealth Management\nCommercial Real Estate\nLoans and Lending\nCommitments by\nProperty Type\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nLC\u2013Lending Commitments\n1.

Amounts may\nfluctuate from period\nto period as overall\nclient balances change\nas a result of market\nlevels, client\npositioning and\nleverage. Credit\nexposures arising from\nmargin lending\nactivities are\ngenerally mitigated by\ntheir short-term\nnature, the value of\ncollateral held and\nour right to call for\nadditional margin when\ncollateral values\ndecline. However, we\ncould incur losses in\nthe event that the\ncustomer fails to meet\nmargin calls and\ncollateral values\ndecline below the loan\namount. This risk is\nelevated in loans\nbacked by collateral\npools with significant\nconcentrations in\nindividual issuers or\nsecurities with\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics.

Counterparty credit ratings are determined\ninternally by the CRM. We are exposed to\ncredit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives.\nCredit risk with respect to derivative\ninstruments arises from the possibility that a\ncounterparty may fail to perform according to\nthe terms of the contract. For a description\nof our risk mitigation strategies, see \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Risk Mitigation\u201d herein. Credit\nDerivatives A credit derivative is a contract\nbetween a seller and buyer of protection\nagainst the risk of a credit event occurring\non one\n\nor more debt obligations issued by a specified\nreference entity. The buyer typically pays a\nperiodic premium over the life of the contract\nand is protected for the period. If a credit\nevent occurs, the seller is required to make\npayment to the beneficiary based on the terms\nof the credit derivative contract. Credit\nevents, as defined in the contract, may be one\nor more of the following defined events:\nbankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the\nreferenced entity, failure to pay, obligation\nacceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium\nand restructuring. We trade in a variety of\ncredit derivatives and may either purchase or\nwrite protection on a single name or portfolio\nof referenced entities. In transactions\nreferencing a portfolio of entities or\nsecurities, protection may be limited to a\ntranche of exposure or a single name within\nthe portfolio. We are an active market maker\nin the credit derivatives markets. As a market\nmaker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on\nclient flow business and manage any residual\ncredit or correlation risk on a portfolio\nbasis. Further, we use credit derivatives to\nmanage our exposure to residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and corporate\nlending exposures. The effectiveness of our\nCDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may\nvary depending upon a number of factors,\nincluding the contractual terms of the CDS. We\nactively monitor our counterparty credit risk\nrelated to credit derivatives. A majority of\nour counterparties are composed of banks,\nbroker-dealers, insurance and other financial\ninstitutions. Contracts with these\ncounterparties may include provisions related\nto counterparty rating downgrades, which may\nresult in the counterparty posting additional\ncollateral to us. As with all derivative\ncontracts, we consider counterparty credit\nrisk in the valuation of our positions and\nrecognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading\nrevenues in the income statement. For\nadditional credit exposure information on our\ncredit derivative portfolio, see Note 6 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                 \n  69    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nCountry Risk Country\nrisk exposure is the\nrisk that events in,\nor that affect, a\nforeign country (any\ncountry other than the\nU.S.) might adversely\naffect us. We actively\nmanage country risk\nexposure through a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement framework\nthat combines credit\nand other market\nfundamentals and\nallows us to\neffectively identify,\nmonitor and limit\ncountry risk. Our\nobligor credit\nevaluation process\ndefines country of\nrisk as the country\nthat has the largest\neconomic impact on the\nobligor and may be\ndifferent from the\nobligor's country of\njurisdiction. Examples\nwhere this applies may\ninclude corporations\nthat are incorporated\nin one country but\nthat derive the bulk\nof their revenue from\nanother and mutual\nfunds incorporated in\none jurisdiction but\nwith a concentration\nof investments in a\ndifferent country. In\naddition to the direct\ncountry risk reflected\nin the \u201cTop 10\nNon-U.S. Country\nExposures\u201d table\nbelow, we also have\nindirect country\nexposure, for example,\nfrom collateral\nreceived in secured\nfinancing transactions\nor from providing\nclient clearing\nservices. These\nindirect exposures are\nmanaged through the\ncredit and market risk\nframeworks. We conduct\nperiodic stress\ntesting that seeks to\nmeasure the impact on\nour credit and market\nexposures of shocks\nstemming from negative\neconomic or political\nscenarios including\nchanges to global\ntrade policies and the\nimplementation of\ntariffs. When deemed\nappropriate by our\nrisk managers, the\nstress test scenarios\ninclude possible\ncontagion effects and\nsecond order risks.\nThis analysis, and\nresults of the stress\ntests, may result in\nthe amendment of\nlimits or exposure\nmitigation. Our\nsovereign exposures\nconsist of financial\ncontracts and\nobligations entered\ninto with sovereign\nand local governments.\nOur non-sovereign\nexposures consist of\nfinancial contracts\nand obligations\nentered into primarily\nwith corporations and\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Index\ncredit derivatives are\nincluded in the\nfollowing \u201cTop 10\nNon-U.S. Country\nExposures\u201d table. Each\nreference entity\nwithin an index is\nallocated to that\nreference entity\u2019s\ncountry of risk. Index\nexposures are\nallocated to the\nunderlying reference\nentities in proportion\nto the notional\nweighting of each\nreference entity in\nthe index, adjusted\nfor any fair value\nreceivable or payable\nfor that reference\nentity. Where credit\nrisk crosses multiple\njurisdictions, for\nexample, a CDS\npurchased from an\nissuer in a specific\ncountry that\nreferences bonds\nissued by an entity in\na different country,\nthe fair value of the\nCDS is reflected in\nthe Net counterparty\nexposure row based on\nthe country of the CDS\nissuer. Further, the\nnotional amount of the\nCDS adjusted for the\nfair value of the\nreceivable or payable\nis reflected in the\nNet inventory row\nbased on the country\nof the underlying\nreference entity.\n\nTop 10 Non-U.S.\nCountry Exposures\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       \u2026       J\u2026       \u2026       G\u2026  \n         \u2026                                    \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n         3       \u2014       30       \u2014       92  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       I\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014       86       \u2026       23  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       7\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       39  \n         \u2014       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026  \n                                              \n1.

Operational Risk\nOperational risk refers to the risk of loss,\nor of damage to our reputation, resulting from\ninadequate or failed processes or systems,\nhuman factors (e.g . , inappropriate or\nunlawful conduct) or external events (e.g.,\ncyberattacks or third-party vulnerabilities)\nthat may manifest as, for example, loss of\ninformation, business disruption, theft and\nfraud, legal and compliance risks, or damage\nto physical assets. We may incur operational\nrisk across the full scope of our business\nactivities, including revenue-generating\nactivities and support and control groups (e.g\n. , IT and trade processing). We have\nestablished an operational risk framework to\nidentify, measure, monitor and control risk\nacross the Firm. Effective operational risk\nmanagement is essential to reducing the impact\nof operational risk incidents and mitigating\nlegal, regulatory and reputational risks. The\nframework is continually evolving to account\nfor changes in the Firm and to respond to the\nchanging regulatory and business environment.\nWe have implemented operational risk data and\nassessment systems to monitor and analyze\ninternal and external operational risk events,\nto assess business environment and internal\ncontrol factors, and to perform scenario\nanalysis. The collected data elements are\nincorporated in the operational risk capital\nmodel. The model encompasses both quantitative\nand qualitative elements. Internal loss data\nand scenario analysis results are direct\ninputs to the capital model, while external\noperational incidents, business environment\nand internal control factors are evaluated as\npart of the scenario analysis process. In\naddition, we employ a variety of risk\nprocesses and mitigants to manage our\noperational risk exposures. These include a\ngovernance framework, a comprehensive risk\nmanagement program and insurance. Operational\nrisks and associated risk exposures are\nassessed relative to the risk appetite\nreviewed and confirmed by the Board and are\nprioritized accordingly. The breadth and range\nof operational risk are such that the types of\nmitigating activities are wide-ranging.\nExamples of activities include: continuous\nenhancement of defenses against cyberattacks,\nuse of legal agreements and contracts to\n\ntransfer and/or limit operational risk\nexposures, due diligence, implementation of\nenhanced policies and procedures, technology\nchange management controls, exception\nmanagement processing controls, and\nsegregation of duties. Primary responsibility\nfor the management of operational risk is with\nthe business segments, the control groups and\nthe business managers therein. The business\nmanagers maintain processes and controls\ndesigned to identify, assess, manage, mitigate\nand report operational risk. Each of the\nbusiness segments has a designated operational\nrisk coordinator. The operational risk\ncoordinator regularly reviews operational risk\nissues and reports to our senior management\nwithin each business. Each control group also\nhas a designated operational risk coordinator\nand a forum for discussing operational risk\nmatters with our senior management. Oversight\nof operational risk is provided by the Non-\nFinancial Risk Committee, legal entity risk\ncommittees, regional risk committees and\nsenior management. In the event of a merger,\njoint venture, divestiture, reorganization, or\ncreation of a new legal entity, a new product,\nor a business activity, operational risks are\nconsidered, and any necessary changes in\nprocesses or controls are implemented. The\nOperational Risk Department and Non-Financial\nRisk Cyber, Technology, and Information\nSecurity Department (\u201cNFR CTIS\u201d) provide\nindependent oversight of operational risk and\nassess, measure and monitor operational risk\nagainst appetite. The Operational Risk\nDepartment and NFR CTIS work with the\ndivisions and control groups to embed a\ntransparent, consistent and comprehensive\nframework for managing operational risk within\neach area and across the Firm. The NFR CTIS\nscope includes oversight of technology risk,\ncybersecurity risk, information security risk\nand compliance. The Operational Risk\nDepartment scope includes oversight of the\nfraud risk management and prevention program,\nand third-party risk management (supplier and\naffiliate risk oversight and assessment),\namong others. Cybersecurity Risk management\nand strategy We, our businesses, and the\nbroader financial services industry face an\nincreasingly complex and evolving threat\nenvironment. We have made and continue to make\nsubstantial investments in cybersecurity and\nfraud prevention technology, and employ\nexperienced talent to lead our Cybersecurity\nand Information Security organizations and\nprogram under the oversight of the Board and\nthe BOTC. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational Risk\u201d\nfor information on risks to the Firm from\ncybersecurity threats. As part of the ERM\nframework, we have implemented and maintain a\nprogram to assess, identify and manage risks\narising from the cybersecurity threats\nconfronting the Firm (\u201cCybersecurity\nProgram\u201d).Our Cybersecurity Program helps\n                                 \n  71    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nprotect our clients,\ncustomers, employees,\nproperty, products,\nservices and\nreputation by seeking\nto preserve the\nconfidentiality,\nintegrity and\navailability of\ninformation, enable\nthe secure delivery of\nfinancial services,\nand protect the\nbusiness and the safe\noperation of our\ntechnology systems. We\ncontinually adjust our\nCybersecurity Program\nto address the\nevolving cybersecurity\nthreat landscape and\ncomply with extensive\nlegal and regulatory\nexpectations.\nProcesses for\nassessing, identifying\nand managing material\nrisks from\ncybersecurity threats\nOur Cybersecurity\nProgram takes into\naccount industry best\npractices and\naddresses risks from\ncybersecurity threats\nto our network,\ninfrastructure,\ncomputing environment\nand the third parties\nthat we rely on.We\nperiodically assess\nthe design of our\ncybersecurity controls\nagainst the Cyber Risk\nInstitute Cyber\nProfile, which is\nbased on the National\nInstitute of Standards\nand Technology\n(\u201cNIST\u201d) Cybersecurity\nFramework for\nImproving Critical\nInfrastructure\nCybersecurity, as well\nas global\ncybersecurity\nregulations, and\ndevelop improvements\nto those controls in\nresponse to that\nassessment. Our\nCybersecurity Program\nalso includes\ncybersecurity and\ninformation security\npolicies, procedures\nand technologies that\nare designed to\naddress regulatory\nrequirements and\nprotect our clients\u2019,\nemployees\u2019 and own\ndata against\nunauthorized\ndisclosure,\nmodification and\nmisuse. These\npolicies, procedures\nand technologies cover\na broad range of\nareas, including:\nidentification of\ninternal and external\nthreats, access\ncontrol, data\nsecurity, protective\ncontrols, detection of\nmalicious or\nunauthorized activity,\nincident response and\nrecovery planning. See\nalso \u201cFirm Resilience\u201d\nherein for a\ndiscussion of our\nresilience program\nthat is designed to\nmitigate the impacts\nof cybersecurity\nevents and other\nrisks. Our threat\nintelligence function\nwithin the\nCybersecurity Program\nactively engages in\nprivate and public\ninformation-sharing\ncommunities and\nleverages both\ncommercial and\nproprietary products\nto collect a wide\nvariety of industry\nand governmental\ninformation regarding\nthe latest\ncybersecurity threats,\nwhich informs our\ncybersecurity risk\nassessments and\nstrategy. This\ninformation is also\nprovided to an\ninternal cyber threat\ndetection team, which\ndevelops and\nimplements strategies\ndesigned to defend\nagainst these\ncybersecurity threats\nacross our\nenvironment. Our\nvulnerability\nmanagement team, as\nwell as NFR, also\nreviews external\ncybersecurity\nincidents that may be\nrelevant to the Firm\nto further inform the\ndesign of our\nCybersecurity Program.\nTo assess the efficacy\nof our controls and\ndefenses designed to\nmitigate cybersecurity\nrisk, we utilize\ninternal and external\ntesting, including\npenetration testing\nand red team\nengagements. The\nresults of these\nassessments are used\nto strengthen the\nCybersecurity Program.\nAdditionally, we\nmaintain a global\ntraining program\ncovering cybersecurity\nrisks and\nrequirements,\nincluding heightened\nsecurity training to\nspecialized employees,\nand conduct regular\nphishing email\nsimulations for our\nemployees and\nconsultants as\npreventative measures.\n\nWhen a threat is\nidentified in our\nenvironment, our\nincident response team\nfollows an incident\nresponse plan to\nevaluate the impact to\nthe Firm and\ncoordinate appropriate\nremediation. If\nwarranted, the\ncybersecurity incident\nwill be reported to\napplicable regulators,\nauthorities, impacted\nclients or\ncounterparties, as\nappropriate. The\nFirm\u2019s cybersecurity\nincident response and\nremediation processes,\nincluding assessing\nmateriality and\nreporting\nrequirements, are\nreviewed through\ntabletop exercises.\nOur processes are\ndesigned to help\noversee, identify and\nmitigate cybersecurity\nrisks associated with\nour use of third-party\nvendors. We maintain a\nthird-party risk\nmanagement program\nthat evaluates and\nresponds to\ncybersecurity risks at\nour third-party\nvendors.Prior to\nengaging third-party\nvendors to provide\nservices to the Firm,\nwe assess the third-\nparty vendors\u2019\ncybersecurity programs\nto identify\ncybersecurity risks\narising from the use\nof those vendors\u2019\nservices. Once\nonboarded, third-party\nvendors\u2019 cybersecurity\nprograms are subject\nto risk-based\noversight, which may\ninclude security\nquestionnaires,\nsubmission of\nindependent security\naudit reports or a\nFirm audit of the\nthird-party vendor\u2019s\nsecurity program, and,\nwith limited\nexceptions, third-\nparty vendors are\nrequired to meet our\nminimum cybersecurity\nstandards.

Unlike\nfinancial instruments\nwhose inputs are\nreadily observable\nand, therefore, more\neasily independently\ncorroborated, the\nvaluation of these\nfinancial instruments\nis inherently\nsubjective and often\ninvolves the use of\nunobservable inputs\nand proprietary\nvaluation models whose\nunderlying algorithms\nand valuation\nmethodologies are\ncomplex.\n\nWe identified the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis and\nLevel 3 loans held for\nsale as a critical\naudit matter given the\nFirm uses complex\nvaluation models\nand/or valuation\ninputs that are not\nobservable in the\nmarketplace to\ndetermine the\nrespective carrying\nvalues. Performing our\naudit procedures to\nevaluate the\nappropriateness of\nthese models and\ninputs involved a high\ndegree of auditor\njudgment,\nprofessionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, and an\nincreased extent of\ntesting.\n\nHow the Critical Audit\nMatter Was Addressed\nin the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures\nrelated to the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis and\nLevel 3 loans held for\nsale included the\nfollowing, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 We tested the design\nand operating\neffectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s model review\nand price verification\ncontrols. The Firm\nmaintains these\ninternal controls to\nassess the\nappropriateness\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    76  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nof its valuation\nmethodologies and the\nrelevant inputs and\nassumptions.\n\n\u2022 We independently\nevaluated the\nappropriateness of\nmanagement\u2019s valuation\nmethodologies, for\nselected financial\ninstruments, including\nthe input assumptions,\nconsidering the\nexpected assumptions\nof other market\nparticipants and\nexternal data when\navailable.\n\n\u2022 We developed\nindependent estimates\nfor selected financial\ninstruments, using\nexternally sourced\ninputs and independent\nvaluation models, and\nused such estimates to\nfurther evaluate\nmanagement\u2019s\nestimates. For certain\nof our selected\nfinancial instruments,\nthis included a\ncomparison to the\nFirm\u2019s estimates for\nsimilar transactions\nand an evaluation of\nthe Firm\u2019s assumptions\ninclusive of the\ninputs, as applicable.\n\n\u2022 We tested the\nrevenues arising from\nthe trade date fair\nvalue estimates for\nselected structured\ntransactions for which\nwe developed\nindependent fair value\nestimates to test the\nvaluation inputs and\nassumptions used by\nthe Firm and evaluated\nwhether these methods\nwere consistent with\nthe Firm\u2019s relevant\nvaluation policies.\n\n\u2022 We assessed the\nconsistency by which\nmanagement has applied\nsignificant and\nunobservable valuation\nassumptions used in\ndeveloping the Firm's\nestimates.\n\n\u2022 We performed a\nretrospective\nassessment of\nmanagement\u2019s fair\nvalue estimates for\ncertain of our\nselected financial\ninstruments, for which\nthere were events or\ntransactions occurring\nafter the valuation\ndate. We did so by\ncomparing management\u2019s\nestimates to the\nrelevant evidence\nprovided by such\nevents or\ntransactions, as\napplicable.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nLLP\n\nNew York, New

Introduction and Basis of Presentation   \n                                              \nThe Firm Morgan Stanley is a global financial\nservices firm that maintains significant\nmarket positions in each of its business\nsegments\u2014Institutional Securities, Wealth\nManagement and Investment Management. Morgan\nStanley, through its subsidiaries and\naffiliates, provides a wide variety of\nproducts and services to a large and\ndiversified group of clients and customers,\nincluding corporations, governments, financial\ninstitutions and individuals. Unless the\ncontext otherwise requires, the terms \u201cMorgan\nStanley\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d mean Morgan Stanley\n(the \u201cParent Company\u201d) together with its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. See the \u201cGlossary\nof Common Terms and Acronyms\u201d for the\ndefinition of certain terms and acronyms used\nthroughout this Form 10-K. A description of\nthe clients and principal products and\nservices of each of the Firm\u2019s business\nsegments is as follows: Institutional\nSecurities provides a variety of products and\nservices to corporations, governments,\nfinancial institutions and ultra-high net\nworth clients. Investment Banking services\nconsist of capital raising and financial\nadvisory services, including the underwriting\nof debt, equity securities and other products,\nas well as advice on mergers and acquisitions,\nrestructurings and project finance. Our Equity\nand Fixed Income businesses include sales,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, market-making,\nAsia wealth management services and certain\nbusiness-related investments. Lending\nactivities include originating corporate loans\nand commercial real estate loans, providing\nsecured lending facilities, and extending\nsecurities-based and other financing to\nclients. Other activities include research.\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive\narray of financial services and solutions to\nindividual investors and small to medium-sized\nbusinesses and institutions. Wealth Management\ncovers: financial advisor-led brokerage,\ncustody, administrative and investment\nadvisory services; self-directed brokerage\nservices; financial and wealth planning\nservices; workplace services, including stock\nplan administration; securities-based lending,\nresidential and commercial real estate loans\nand other lending products; banking; and\nretirement plan services. Investment\nManagement provides a broad range of\ninvestment strategies and products that span\ngeographies, asset classes, and public and\nprivate markets to a diverse group of clients\nacross institutional and intermediary\nchannels. Strategies and products, which are\noffered through a variety of investment\nvehicles, include equity, fixed income,\nalternatives and solutions, and liquidity and\noverlay services. Institutional clients\ninclude defined benefit/defined contribution\nplans, foundations, endowments, government\nentities, sovereign wealth funds,\n\ninsurance companies, third-party fund sponsors\nand corporations. Individual clients are\ngenerally served through intermediaries,\nincluding affiliated and non-affiliated\ndistributors. Basis of Financial Information\nThe financial statements are prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the\nFirm to make estimates and assumptions\nregarding the valuations of certain financial\ninstruments, the valuations of goodwill and\nintangible assets, the outcome of legal and\ntax matters, deferred tax assets, ACL, and\nother matters that affect its financial\nstatements and related disclosures. The Firm\nbelieves that the estimates utilized in the\npreparation of its financial statements are\nprudent and reasonable. Actual results could\ndiffer materially from these estimates. The\nNotes are an integral part of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements. The Firm has evaluated\nsubsequent events for adjustment to or\ndisclosure in these financial statements\nthrough the date of this report and has not\nidentified any recordable or disclosable\nevents not otherwise reported in these\nfinancial statements or the notes thereto.\nConsolidation The financial statements include\nthe accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries and other entities in which the\nFirm has a controlling financial interest,\nincluding certain VIEs (see Note 15).\nIntercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries\nthat are not wholly owned, the third-party\nholdings of equity interests are referred to\nas Noncontrolling interests. The net income\nattributable to Noncontrolling interests for\nsuch subsidiaries is presented as Net income\napplicable to noncontrolling interests in the\nincome statement. The portion of shareholders\u2019\nequity that is attributable to Noncontrolling\ninterests for such subsidiaries is presented\nas Noncontrolling interests, a component of\nTotal equity, in the balance sheet. For\nentities where the total equity investment at\nrisk is sufficient to enable the entity to\nfinance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support and the equity\nholders bear the residual economic risks and\nreturns of the entity and have the power to\ndirect the activities of the entity that most\nsignificantly affect its economic performance,\nthe Firm consolidates those entities it\ncontrols either through a majority voting\ninterest or otherwise. For VIEs (i.e.,\nentities that do not meet the aforementioned\ncriteria), the Firm consolidates those\nentities where it has the power to make the\ndecisions that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the VIE and has the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. For investments in\nentities in which the Firm does not have a\ncontrolling financial interest but has\nsignificant influence over operating and\nfinancial decisions, it applies the equity\nmethod\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    82  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nof accounting with net\ngains and losses\nrecorded within Other\nrevenues (see Note 11)\nunless the Firm has\nelected to measure the\ninvestment at fair\nvalue, in which case\nnet gains and losses\nare recorded within\nInvestments revenues\n(see Note 5). Equity\nand partnership\ninterests held by\nentities qualifying\nfor accounting\npurposes as investment\ncompanies are carried\nat fair value. The\nFirm\u2019s significant\nregulated U.S. and\ninternational\nsubsidiaries include:\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley & Co.\nLLC (\u201cMS&Co.\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Smith\nBarney LLC (\u201cMSSB\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Europe\nSE (\u201cMSESE\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley & Co.\nInternational plc\n(\u201cMSIP\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Capital\nServices LLC (\u201cMSCS\u201d),\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley\nCapital Group Inc.\n(\u201cMSCG\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley MUFG\nSecurities Co., Ltd.\n(\u201cMSMS\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cMSBNA\u201d) and \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Private Bank,\nNational Association\n(\u201cMSPBNA\u201d). For\nfurther information on\nthe Firm\u2019s significant\nregulated U.S. and\ninternational\nsubsidiaries, see Note\n16.\n                                              \n  2. Significant Accounting Policies          \n                                              \nPresentation Changes in 2024 In the first\nquarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain\npresentation changes which resulted in a\ndecrease to both interest income and interest\nexpense of $ 4,432million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and no effect on net\ninterest income, with the entire impact to the\nFirm recorded within the Institutional\nSecurities segment. These changes further\naligned the accounting treatment between the\nbalance sheet and the related interest income\nor expense, primarily by offsetting interest\nincome and expense for certain prime\nbrokerage-related customer receivables and\npayables that are currently accounted for as a\nsingle unit of account on the balance sheet.\nThe current and previous presentation of these\ninterest income and interest expense amounts\nare acceptable and the change does not\nrepresent a change in accounting principle.\nThese changes were applied retrospectively to\nthe consolidated income statement for 2023 and\naccordingly, 2023 amounts were adjusted to\nconform with the current presentation. Revenue\nRecognition Revenues are recognized when the\npromised goods or services are delivered to\nour customers in an amount that is based on\nthe consideration the Firm expects to receive\nin exchange for those goods or services when\nsuch amounts are not probable of significant\nreversal.\n\nInvestment Banking Revenues from investment\nbanking activities consist of revenues earned\nfrom underwriting, primarily equity and fixed\nincome securities and loan syndications, and\nadvisory fees, primarily for mergers,\nacquisitions and restructurings. Underwriting\nrevenues are generally recognized on trade\ndate if there is no uncertainty or contingency\nrelated to the amount to be paid. Underwriting\ncosts are deferred and recognized in the\nrelevant non-interest expenses line items when\nthe related underwriting revenues are\nrecorded. Advisory fees are recognized as\nadvice is provided to the client, based on the\nestimated progress of work and when revenues\nare not probable of a significant reversal.\nAdvisory costs are recognized as incurred in\nthe relevant non-interest expenses line items,\nincluding those reimbursed. Commissions and\nFees Commission and fee revenues generally\nresult from transaction-based arrangements in\nwhich the client is charged a fee for the\nexecution of transactions. Such revenues\nprimarily arise from transactions in equity\nsecurities; services related to sales and\ntrading activities; and sales of mutual funds,\nalternative funds, futures, insurance products\nand options, as well as revenues from order\nflow payments for directing customer orders to\nbroker-dealers, exchanges and market centers\nfor execution. Commission and fee revenues are\nrecognized on trade date when the performance\nobligation is satisfied. Asset Management\nRevenues Asset management, distribution and\nadministration fees are generally based on\nrelated asset levels, such as the AUM of a\ncustomer\u2019s account or the net asset value of a\nfund. These fees are generally recognized when\nservices are performed and the value of the\nassets is known. Management fees are reduced\nby estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if\nany, provided to the customer. Performance-\nbased fees not in the form of carried interest\nare recorded when the annual performance\ntarget is met and the revenues are not\nprobable of a significant reversal. Sales\ncommissions paid by the Firm in connection\nwith the sale of certain classes of shares of\nits open-end mutual fund products are\naccounted for as deferred commission assets\nand amortized to Other expenses over the\nexpected life of the contract. The Firm\nperiodically tests deferred commission assets\nfor recoverability based on cash flows\nexpected to be received in future periods.\nOther asset management and distribution costs\nare recognized as incurred in the relevant\nnon-interest expenses line items.\n                                 \n  83    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nInvestments Revenues\u2014Carried Interest The Firm\nis entitled to receive performance-based fees\nin the form of carried interest when the\nreturn in certain funds exceeds specified\nperformance targets. When the Firm earns\ncarried interest from funds as specified\nperformance thresholds are met, that carried\ninterest and any related general or limited\npartner interest are accounted for under the\nequity method of accounting and measured based\non the Firm\u2019s claim on the NAV of the fund at\nthe reporting date, taking into account the\ndistribution terms applicable to the interest\nheld. Such items are reflected within\nInvestments revenues. See Note 22 for\ninformation regarding the net cumulative\nunrealized amount of performance-based fee\nrevenues at risk of reversal. See Note 14 for\ninformation regarding general partner\nguarantees, which include potential\nobligations to return performance fee\ndistributions previously received. Other Items\nRevenues from certain commodities-related\ncontracts are recognized in Trading revenues\nwhen the Firm has transferred control over the\npromised goods or services to the customer.\nReceivables from contracts with customers are\nrecognized in Customer and other receivables\nin the balance sheet when the underlying\nperformance obligations have been satisfied\nand the Firm has the right per the contract to\nbill the customer. Contract assets are\nrecognized in Other assets when the Firm has\nsatisfied its performance obligations but\ncustomer payment is conditional on something\nother than the passage of time. Contract\nliabilities are recognized in Other\nliabilities and accrued expenses when the Firm\nhas collected payment from a customer based on\nthe terms of the contract but the underlying\nperformance obligations are not yet satisfied.\nFor contracts with a term of less than one\nyear, incremental costs to obtain the contract\nare expensed as incurred. Revenues are not\ndiscounted when payment is expected within one\nyear. The Firm generally presents, net within\nrevenues, taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and\nconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing\ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a\ncustomer. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and\ncash equivalents consist of Cash and due from\nbanks and interest-bearing deposits with\nbanks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid\ninvestments with remaining maturities of three\nmonths or less from the acquisition date that\nare readily convertible to cash and are not\nheld for trading purposes. Cash and cash\nequivalents also include Restricted cash, such\nas cash segregated in compliance with federal\nor other regulations, including minimum\nreserve requirements set by the Federal\nReserve Bank and other central banks, and the\nFirm\u2019s initial margin deposited with clearing\norganizations. Fair Value of Financial\nInstruments Instruments within Trading assets\nand Trading liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue, either as required or allowed by\naccounting guidance. These financial\ninstruments primarily represent the Firm\u2019s\ntrading and investment positions and include\nboth cash and derivative products. In\naddition, securities classified as Available-\nfor-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) are measured at fair value.\nGains and losses on instruments carried at\nfair value are reflected in Trading revenues,\nInvestments revenues or Investment banking\nrevenues in the income statement, except for\ngains and losses related to AFS securities\n(see \u201cAFS Investment Securities\u201d section\nherein and Note 7) and derivatives accounted\nfor as hedges, as well as economic derivative\nhedges associated with certain held-for-sale\nand held-for-investment corporate loans and\nlending commitments (see \u201cHedge Accounting\u201d\nand \u201cOther Hedges\u201d herein and Note 6).\nInterest income and interest expense are\nrecorded within the income statement depending\non the nature of the instrument and related\nmarket conventions. When interest is included\nas a component of the instruments\u2019 fair value,\ninterest is recorded within Trading revenues\nor Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is\nrecorded within Interest income or Interest\nexpense. Dividend income is recorded in\nTrading revenues or Investments revenues\ndepending on the business activity. The fair\nvalue of OTC financial instruments, including\nderivative contracts related to financial\ninstruments and commodities, is presented in\nthe accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis, when appropriate.\nAdditionally, the Firm nets the fair value of\ncash collateral paid or received against the\nfair value amounts recognized for net\nderivative positions executed with the same\ncounterparty under the same master netting\nagreement. Fair Value Option The Firm has\nelected to measure certain eligible\ninstruments at fair value, including\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, Loans and lending commitments, equity\nmethod investments and certain other assets,\nDeposits, Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, Other secured financings and\nBorrowings. Fair Value Measurement\u2014Definition\nand Hierarchy Fair value is defined as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability (i.e ., the\n\u201cexit price\u201d) in\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    84  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nan orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair\nvalue is a market-based measure considered\nfrom the perspective of a market participant\nrather than an entity-specific measure.\nTherefore, even when market assumptions are\nnot readily available, assumptions are set to\nreflect those that the Firm believes market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability at the measurement date. Where the\nFirm manages a group of financial assets,\nfinancial liabilities, and nonfinancial items\naccounted for as derivatives on the basis of\nits net exposure to either market risks or\ncredit risk, the Firm measures the fair value\nof that group of financial instruments\nconsistently with how market participants\nwould price the net risk exposure at the\nmeasurement date. In determining fair value,\nthe Firm uses various valuation approaches and\nestablishes a hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that requires the most\nobservable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability that were developed based on market\ndata obtained from sources independent of the\nFirm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that\nreflect assumptions the Firm believes other\nmarket participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability that are developed based on\nthe best information available in the\ncircumstances. The fair value hierarchy is\nbroken down into three levels based on the\nobservability of inputs as follows, with Level\n1 being the highest and Level 3 being the\nlowest level: Level 1. Valuations based on\nquoted prices in active markets that the Firm\nhas the ability to access for identical assets\nor liabilities. Valuation adjustments, block\ndiscounts and discounts for entity-specific\nand contractual restrictions that would not\ntransfer to market participants are not\napplied to Level 1 instruments. Since\nvaluations are based on quoted prices that are\nreadily and regularly available in an active\nmarket, valuation of these products does not\nentail a significant degree of judgment. Level\n2. Valuations based on quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in inactive\nmarkets, significant market inputs other than\nquoted prices that are observable for the\nasset or liability, or market-corroborated\ninputs. Level 3. Valuations based on inputs\nthat are unobservable and significant to the\noverall fair value measurement. The\navailability of observable inputs can vary\nfrom product to product and is affected by a\nwide variety of factors, including the type of\nproduct, whether the product is new and not\nyet established in the marketplace, the\nliquidity of markets and other characteristics\nparticular to the product. To the extent that\nvaluation is based on models or inputs that\nare less observable or unobservable in the\nmarket, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the\ndegree of judgment exercised by the Firm in\ndetermining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. The Firm considers prices and\ninputs that are current as of the measurement\ndate, including during periods of market\ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation,\nthe observability of prices and inputs may be\nreduced for many instruments. This condition\ncould cause an instrument to be reclassified\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue may fall into different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total\nfair value amount is disclosed in the level\nappropriate for the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the total fair value of the\nasset or liability. Valuation Techniques Many\ncash instruments and OTC derivative contracts\nhave bid and ask prices that can be observed\nin the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the\nhighest price that a party is willing to pay\nfor an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest\nprice that a party is willing to accept for an\nasset. The Firm carries positions at the point\nwithin the bid-ask range that meets its best\nestimate of fair value. For offsetting\npositions in the same financial instrument,\nthe same price within the bid-ask spread is\nused to measure both the long and short\npositions. Fair value for many cash\ninstruments and OTC derivative contracts is\nderived using pricing models. Pricing models\ntake into account the contract terms, as well\nas multiple inputs, including, where\napplicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves,\ncorrelation, creditworthiness of the\ncounterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm,\noption volatility and currency rates. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty, and concentration risk and\nfunding in order to arrive at fair value.\nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-\nderived mid-market amounts of Level 2 and\nLevel 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid\nor mid-ask spread required to properly reflect\nthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and\nmid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed\nin trade activity, broker quotes or other\nexternal third-party data. Where these spreads\nare unobservable for the particular position\nin question, spreads are derived from\nobservable levels of similar positions. The\nFirm applies credit-related valuation\nadjustments to its Borrowings for which the\nfair value option was elected and to OTC\nderivatives. The Firm considers the impact of\nchanges in its own credit spreads based upon\nobservations of the secondary bond market\nspreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings.\n                                 \n  85    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nFor OTC derivatives, which are recognized in\nTrading assets at fair value in the balance\nsheet, the impact of changes in both the\nFirm\u2019s and the counterparty\u2019s credit rating is\nconsidered when measuring fair value. In\ndetermining the expected exposure, the Firm\nsimulates the distribution of the future\nexposure to a counterparty, then applies\nmarket-based default probabilities to the\nfuture exposure, leveraging external third-\nparty CDS spread data. Where CDS spread data\nare unavailable for a specific counterparty,\nbond market spreads, CDS spread data based on\nthe counterparty\u2019s credit rating or CDS spread\ndata that reference a comparable counterparty\nmay be utilized. The Firm also considers\ncollateral held and legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that mitigate its exposure\nto each counterparty. Adjustments for model\nuncertainty are taken for positions whose\nunderlying models are reliant on significant\ninputs that are neither directly nor\nindirectly observable, hence requiring\nreliance on established theoretical concepts\nin their derivation. These adjustments are\nderived by making assessments of the possible\ndegree of variability using statistical\napproaches and market-based information where\npossible. The Firm may apply concentration\nadjustments to certain of its OTC derivative\nportfolios to reflect the additional cost of\nclosing out a particularly large risk\nexposure. Where possible, these adjustments\nare based on observable market information,\nbut in many instances, significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the costs of closing out\nconcentrated risk exposures due to the lack of\nliquidity in the marketplace. The Firm applies\nan FVA in the fair value measurements of OTC\nuncollateralized or partially collateralized\nderivatives and in collateralized derivatives\nwhere the terms of the agreement do not permit\nthe reuse of the collateral received. In\ngeneral, FVA reflects a market funding risk\npremium inherent in the noted derivative\ninstruments. The methodology for measuring FVA\nleverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-related\nvaluation adjustment calculation\nmethodologies, which apply to both assets and\nliabilities. See Note 4 for a description of\nvaluation techniques applied to the major\ncategories of financial instruments measured\nat fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured\nat Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Certain\nof the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis. The Firm incurs losses or gains for any\nadjustments of these assets or liabilities to\nfair value. For assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, fair value is determined by using\nvarious valuation approaches. The same\nhierarchy for inputs as described above, which\nrequires that observable inputs be used when\navailable, is used in measuring fair value for\nthese items. For further information on\nfinancial assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis, see Note 4. Offsetting of\nDerivative Instruments In connection with its\nderivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and\ncollateral agreements with its counterparties.\nThese agreements provide the Firm with the\nright, in the event of a default by the\ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under the agreement and to\nliquidate and set off cash collateral against\nany net amount owed by the counterparty.\nDerivatives with enforceable master netting\nagreements are reported net of cash collateral\nreceived and posted. However, in certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may not have such an\nagreement in place; the relevant insolvency\nregime may not support the enforceability of\nthe master netting agreement or collateral\nagreement; or the Firm may not have sought\nlegal advice to support the enforceability of\nthe agreement. In cases where the Firm has not\ndetermined an agreement to be enforceable, the\nrelated amounts are not offset (see Note 6).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash\nand/or securities posted as collateral (with\nrights of rehypothecation) in connection with\nderivative transactions, irrespective of the\nenforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In\ncertain cases, the Firm may agree for such\ncollateral to be posted by the counterparty to\na third-party custodian under a control\nagreement that enables it to take control of\nsuch collateral in the event of a counterparty\ndefault. The enforceability of the master\nnetting agreement is taken into account in the\nFirm\u2019s risk management practices and\napplication of counterparty credit limits. For\ninformation related to offsetting of\nderivatives, see Note 6. Hedge Accounting The\nFirm applies hedge accounting using various\nderivative financial instruments for the\nfollowing types of hedges: hedges of changes\nin the fair value of assets and liabilities\ndue to the risk being hedged (fair value\nhedges); hedges of variability in forecasted\ncash flows from floating-rate assets due to\ncontractually specified interest rates (cash\nflow hedges) and hedges of net investments in\nforeign operations whose functional currency\nis different from the reporting currency of\nthe Parent Company (net investment hedges).\nThese financial instruments are included\nwithin Trading assets\u2014Derivative and other\ncontracts or Trading liabilities\u2014Derivative\nand other contracts in the balance sheet. For\nhedges where hedge accounting is being\napplied, the Firm performs effectiveness\ntesting and other procedures. The change in\nthe fair value of the designated portion of\nthe hedging instrument should be\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    86  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nhighly correlated, between 80and 125percent of\nthe change in the fair value, cash flows, or\ncarrying value (due to translation gains or\nlosses) of the hedged item attributable to the\nrisk being hedged. The Firm considers the\nimpact of valuation adjustments related to\ncounterparty credit spreads and its own credit\nspreads to determine whether they would cause\nthe hedging relationship to be ineffective.\nFair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk The\nFirm\u2019s designated fair value hedges consist of\ninterest rate swaps designated as hedges of\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate of\ncertain fixed-rate AFS securities and senior\nborrowings. The Firm also designates interest\nrate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate of certain fixed\nrate deposits. The Firm is permitted to hedge\nthe full, or part of the contractual term of\nthe hedged instrument. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to perform an ongoing\nprospective and retrospective assessment of\nthe effectiveness of these hedging\nrelationships. For qualifying fair value\nhedges of benchmark interest rates, the change\nin the fair value of the derivative, offset by\nthe change in the fair value attributable to\nthe change in the benchmark interest rate risk\nof the hedged asset (liability), is recognized\nin earnings each period as a component of\nInterest income (expense). For AFS securities,\nthe change in fair value of the hedged item\ndue to changes other than the risk being\nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI.\nWhen a derivative is de-designated as a hedge,\nany basis adjustment remaining on the hedged\nasset (liability) is amortized to Interest\nincome (expense) over the remaining life of\nthe asset (liability) using the effective\ninterest method. For certain AFS securities,\nthe Firm also applies the portfolio layer\nmethod of hedge accounting, which permits\nprepayable and non-prepayable assets to be\nincluded in the portfolio and allows more of\nthe portfolio to be hedged. Further, the\nportfolio layer method of accounting requires\nthat basis adjustments are maintained at the\nportfolio level and not allocated to\nindividual items until certain de-designation\nevents occur. The amount designated as hedged\nis the sum of the notional amounts of all\noutstanding layers in each portfolio. Refer to\nNote 6 and Note 7 to the financial statements\nfor additional information on portfolio layer\nmethod hedging. Net Investment Hedges The Firm\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to\nmanage a portion of the currency exposure\nrelating to its net investments in foreign\noperations. To the extent that the notional\namounts of the hedging instruments equal the\nportion of the investments being hedged and\nthe underlying exchange rate of the derivative\nhedging instrument is the same as the exchange\nrate between the functional currency of the\ninvestee and the intermediate parent entity\u2019s\nfunctional currency, it is considered to be\nperfectly effective. The gain or loss from\nrevaluing qualifying hedges of net investments\nin foreign operations at the spot rate is\nreported within AOCI. The forward points on\nthe hedging instruments are excluded from\nhedge effectiveness testing and changes in the\nfair value of this excluded component are\nrecorded currently in Interest income. Cash\nFlow Hedges\u2014Interest Rate Risk The Firm\u2019s\ndesignated cash flow hedges consist of\ninterest rate derivatives designated as hedges\nof variability in forecasted cash flows from\nfloating-rate assets due to changes in the\ncontractually specified interest rates. The\nFirm uses regression analysis to perform an\nongoing prospective and retrospective\nassessment of the effectiveness of these\nhedging relationships. The objective of this\nstrategy is to hedge the risk of changes in\nthe hedged item\u2019s cash flows attributable to\nchanges in the contractually specified\ninterest rate. For qualifying cash flow hedges\nof contractually specified interest rates,\nchanges in the fair value of the derivative\nare recorded in OCI and subsequently\nreclassified to earnings in the same periods\nwhen the hedged item affects earnings. If cash\nflow hedge accounting is discontinued, AOCI is\nreleased into earnings immediately if the cash\nflow of the hedged item is probable of not\noccurring. Otherwise the amount in AOCI is\nreleased into earnings as the forecasted\ntransaction affects earnings. Other Hedges In\naddition to hedges that are designated and\nqualify for hedge accounting, the Firm uses\nderivatives to economically hedge credit risk\nassociated with certain held-for-sale and\nheld-for-investment corporate loans and\nlending commitments, and the related gains and\nlosses are reported within Other revenues in\nthe income statement. For further information\non derivative instruments and hedging\nactivities, see Note 6. AFS Investment\nSecurities AFS securities are reported at fair\nvalue in the balance sheet. Interest income,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, is included in\nInterest income in the income statement.\nUnrealized gains are recorded in OCI, and\nunrealized losses are recorded either in OCI\nor in Other revenues as described below. AFS\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position are\nfirst evaluated to determine whether there is\nan intent to sell or it is more likely than\nnot the Firm will be required to sell before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. If so,\nthe amortized cost basis is written down to\nthe fair value of the security such that the\nentire unrealized loss is recognized in Other\nrevenues, and any previously established ACL\nis written off. For all other AFS securities\nin an unrealized loss position, any portion of\nunrealized losses representing a credit loss\nis recognized in Other revenues and as an\nincrease to the ACL for AFS securities, with\nthe remainder of unrealized losses recognized\nin OCI. A credit loss exists if the Firm does\nnot expect to recover the amortized cost basis\nof the security.\n                                 \n  87    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nWhen considering\nwhether a credit loss\nexists, the Firm\nconsiders relevant\ninformation,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 guarantees (implicit\nor explicit) by the\nU.S. government;\n\n\u2022 the extent to which\nthe fair value has\nbeen less than the\namortized cost basis;\n\n\u2022 adverse conditions\nspecifically related\nto the security, its\nindustry or geographic\narea;\n\n\u2022 changes in the\nfinancial condition of\nthe issuer of the\nsecurity or, in the\ncase of an asset-\nbacked debt security,\nchanges in the\nfinancial condition of\nthe underlying loan\nobligors;\n\n\u2022 the payment\nstructure of the debt\nsecurity and the\nlikelihood of the\nissuer being able to\nmake payments that\nincrease in the\nfuture;\n\n\u2022 failure of the\nissuer of the security\nto make scheduled\ninterest or principal\npayments;\n\n\u2022 the current rating\nand any changes to the\nrating of the security\nby a rating agency.\n\nIf a credit loss\nexists, the Firm\nmeasures the credit\nloss as the difference\nbetween the present\nvalue of cash flows\nexpected to be\ncollected (discounted\nat the implicit\ninterest rate at\nacquisition of the\nsecurity or discounted\nat the effective yield\nfor securities that\nincorporate changes in\nprepayment\nassumptions) and the\namortized cost basis\nof the security.\nChanges in prepayment\nassumptions alone are\nnot considered to\nresult in a credit\nloss. When estimating\nthe present value of\nexpected cash flows,\ninformation utilized\nincludes the remaining\npayment terms of the\nsecurity, prepayment\nspeeds, financial\ncondition of the\nissuer, expected\ndefaults and the value\nof any underlying\ncollateral.\nPresentation of ACL\nand Provision for\nCredit Losses\n                                              \n                                Provision     \n                 ACL            for           \n                                Credit        \n                                Losses        \n  AFS            Contra         Other         \n  securities     investment     revenue       \n                 securities                   \n                                              \nNonaccrual & ACL\nCharge-offs on AFS\nSecurities\n\nAFS securities follow\nthe same nonaccrual\nand charge-off\nguidance as discussed\nin \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses\u201d herein.\n\nHTM Securities\n\nHTM securities are\nreported at amortized\ncost, net of any ACL,\nin the balance sheet.\nRefer to \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d\nherein for guidance on\nthe ACL determination.\nInterest income,\nincluding amortization\nof premiums and\naccretion of discounts\non HTM securities, is\nincluded in Interest\nincome in the income\nstatement.\nLoans The Firm accounts for loans based on the\nfollowing categories: loans held for\ninvestment; loans held for sale; and loans at\nfair value.\n\nNonaccrual and ACL Charge-offs on Loans All\nloan categories described below follow the\nsame nonaccrual guidance and loans held for\ninvestment follow the charge-off guidance as\ndiscussed in \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d\nherein. Loans Held for Investment Loans held\nfor investment are reported at amortized cost,\nwhich consists of the outstanding principle\nbalance adjusted for any charge-offs, the\nallowance for credit losses, any unamortized\ndeferred fees or costs for originated loans,\nand any unamortized premiums or discounts for\npurchased loans. Interest Income. Interest\nincome on performing loans held for investment\nis accrued and recognized as interest income\nat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase\nprice discounts or premiums, as well as net\ndeferred loan fees or costs, are amortized\ninto interest income over the life of the loan\nto produce a level rate of return. Lending\nCommitments. The Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the credit exposure\nrelated to commitments to fund loans. The\nliability is recorded in Other liabilities and\naccrued expenses in the balance sheet and the\nexpense is recorded in the Provision for\ncredit losses in the income statement. For\nmore information regarding loan commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, see Note 14. For more information\nregarding allowance for credit losses, refer\nto \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein. Loans\nHeld for Sale Loans held for sale are measured\nat the lower of amortized cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes recorded in Other\nrevenues. The Firm determines the valuation\nallowance on an individual loan basis, except\nfor residential mortgage loans for which the\nvaluation allowance is determined at the loan\nproduct level. Any decreases in fair value\nbelow the initial carrying amount and any\nrecoveries in fair value up to the initial\ncarrying amount are recorded in Other\nrevenues. Increases in fair value above\ninitial carrying value are not recognized.\nInterest Income. Interest income on loans held\nfor sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums are deferred as an\nadjustment to the loan\u2019s cost basis until the\nrelated loan is sold and, as such, are\nincluded in the periodic determination of the\nlower of cost or fair value adjustments and\nthe gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Lending Commitments. Commitments to fund\nmortgage loans held for sale are derivatives\nand are reported in Trading assets or Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheet and in\nTrading revenues in the income statement.\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    88  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nFor commitments to fund non-mortgage loans,\nthe Firm records the liability and related\nexpense for the fair value exposure below cost\nof such commitments in Other liabilities and\naccrued expenses in the balance sheet with an\noffset to Other revenues in the income\nstatement. Because loans and lending\ncommitments held for sale are recognized at\nthe lower of cost or fair value, the allowance\nfor credit losses and charge-off policies do\nnot apply to these loans. Loans at Fair Value\nLoans for which the fair value option is\nelected are carried at fair value and included\nin Trading assets in the balance sheet, with\nchanges in fair value recognized in earnings.\nFor further information on loans carried at\nfair value and classified as Trading assets,\nsee Note 4. Lending Commitments. The Firm\nrecords the liability and related expense for\nthe fair value exposure related to commitments\nto fund loans that will be measured at fair\nvalue. The liability is recorded in Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheet, and the\nexpense is recorded in Trading revenues in the\nincome statement. Because such loans and\nlending commitments are reported at fair\nvalue, the allowance for credit losses and\ncharge-off policies do not apply to these\nloans. For further information on loans, see\nNote 9. For more information regarding loan\ncommitments, standby letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees, see Note 14. Allowance\nfor Credit Losses The ACL for financial\ninstruments measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g .,\nHFI loans and lending commitments, HTM\nsecurities, customer and other receivables and\ncertain guarantees) represents an estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the entire life of\nthe financial instrument. Factors considered\nby management when determining the ACL include\npayment status, fair value of collateral and\nexpected payments of principal and interest,\nas well as internal or external information\nrelating to past events, current conditions,\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts. The\nFirm uses three forecasts that include\nassumptions about certain macroeconomic\nvariables, including, but not limited to, U.S.\ngross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), equity market\nindices and unemployment rates, as well as\ncommercial real estate and home price indices.\nAt the conclusion of the Firm\u2019s reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of 13 quarters,\nthere is a gradual reversion back to\nhistorical averages. The ACL is measured on a\ncollective basis when similar risk\ncharacteristics exist for multiple\ninstruments, considering all available\ninformation relevant to assessing the\ncollectability of cash flows. Generally, the\nFirm applies a probability of default/loss\ngiven default model for instruments that are\ncollectively assessed, under which the ACL is\ncalculated as the product of probability of\ndefault, loss given default and exposure at\ndefault. These parameters are forecast for\neach collective group of assets using a\nscenario-based statistical model. If the\ninstrument does not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with other instruments,\nincluding when it is probable that the Firm\nwill be unable to collect the full payment of\nprincipal and interest on the instrument when\ndue, the ACL is measured on an individual\nbasis. The Firm generally applies a discounted\ncash flow method for instruments that are\nindividually assessed. The Firm may also elect\nto use an approach that considers the fair\nvalue of the collateral when measuring the ACL\nif the loan is collateral dependent (i.e .,\nrepayment of the loan is expected to be\nprovided substantially by the sale or\noperation of the underlying collateral and the\nborrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty). Additionally, the Firm can elect\nto use an approach to measure the ACL that\nconsiders the fair value of collateral where\nthe borrower is required to, and reasonably\nexpected to, continually adjust and replenish\nthe amount of collateral securing the\ninstrument to reflect changes in the fair\nvalue of such collateral. The Firm has elected\nto use this approach for certain securities-\nbased loans, margin loans, securities\npurchased under agreements to resell and\nsecurities borrowed. Credit quality indicators\nconsidered in developing the ACL include: \u2022\nCorporate loans, secured lending facilities,\ncommercial real estate loans and securities,\nand other loans: Internal risk ratings\ndeveloped by the CRM that are refreshed at\nleast annually, and more frequently as\nnecessary. These ratings generally correspond\nto external ratings published by S&P. The Firm\nalso considers transaction structure,\nincluding type of collateral, collateral terms\nand position of the obligation within the\ncapital structure. In addition, for commercial\nreal estate, the Firm considers property type\nand location, net operating income and LTV\nratios, among other factors, as well as\ncommercial real estate price and credit spread\nindices and capitalization rates. \u2022\nResidential real estate loans: Loan\norigination Fair Isaac Corporation (\u201cFICO\u201d)\ncredit scores as determined by independent\ncredit agencies in the U.S. and LTV ratios. \u2022\nEmployee loans: Employment status, which\nincludes those currently employed by the Firm\nand for which the Firm can deduct any unpaid\namounts due to it through certain compensation\narrangements; and those no longer employed by\nthe Firm where such arrangements are no longer\napplicable. Qualitative and environmental\nfactors such as economic and business\nconditions, the nature and volume of the\nportfolio,\n                                 \n  89    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nand lending terms and\nthe volume and\nseverity of past due\nloans are also\nconsidered in the ACL\ncalculations.\n\nPresentation of ACL\nand Provision for\nCredit Losses\n                                              \n                                 Provision    \n                 ACL             for          \n                                 Credit       \n                                 Losses       \n  Held for                       Provision    \n  investment     Contra asset    for credit   \n  loans                          losses       \n  Other                                       \n  instruments                                 \n  measured at                                 \n  amortized                                   \n  cost                           Other        \n  (e.g.,HTM      Contra asset    revenues     \n  securities                                  \n  and                                         \n  customer                                    \n  and other                                   \n  receivable\u2026                                 \n                                 Compensati\u2026  \n  Employee       Contra asset    and          \n  loans                          benefits     \n                                 expenses     \n  Held for       Other           Provision    \n  investment     liabilities     for credit   \n  lending        and accrued     losses       \n  commitments    expenses                     \n  Other                                       \n  off-balance    Other                        \n  sheet          liabilities     Other        \n  instruments    and accrued     expenses     \n  (e.g.,cert\u2026    expenses                     \n  guarantees)                                 \n                                              \nNonaccrual\n\nThe Firm places\nfinancial instruments\non nonaccrual status\nif principal or\ninterest is not\nexpected when\ncontractually due or\nis past due for a\nperiod of 90 days or\nmore unless the\nobligation is well-\nsecured and is in the\nprocess of collection.\n\nFor any instrument\nplaced on nonaccrual\nstatus, the Firm\nreverses any unpaid\ninterest accrued with\nan offsetting\nreduction to Interest\nincome. Principal and\ninterest payments\nreceived on nonaccrual\ninstruments are\napplied to principal\nif there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate\ncollectability of\nprincipal. If\ncollection of the\nprincipal is not in\ndoubt, interest income\nis realized on a cash\nbasis. If the\ninstrument is brought\ncurrent and neither\nprincipal nor interest\ncollection is in\ndoubt, instruments can\ngenerally return to\naccrual status, and\ninterest income can be\nrecognized.\n\nACL Charge-offs\n\nThe principal balance\nof a financial\ninstrument is charged\noff in the period it\nis deemed\nuncollectible,\nresulting in a\nreduction in the ACL\nand in the balance of\nthe financial\ninstrument in the\nbalance sheet. Accrued\ninterest receivable\nbalances that are\nseparately recorded\nfrom the related\nfinancial instruments\nare charged off\nagainst Interest\nincome when the\nrelated financial\ninstrument is placed\non nonaccrual status.\nAccordingly, the Firm\nelected not to measure\nan ACL for accrued\ninterest receivables.\nTransfers of Financial Assets Transfers of\nfinancial assets are accounted for as sales\nwhen the Firm has relinquished control over\nthe transferred assets. Any related gain or\nloss on sale is recorded in Net revenues.\nTransfers that are not accounted for as sales\nare treated as collateralized financings.\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell and securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase are\ntreated as collateralized financings (see Note\n8). Securities purchased under agreements to\nresell (\u201creverse repurchase agreements\u201d) and\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(\u201crepurchase agreements\u201d),\n\nincluding repurchase and reverse repurchase\nagreements-to-maturity, are carried in the\nbalance sheet at the amount of cash paid or\nreceived plus accrued interest except for\ncertain reverse repurchase and repurchase\nagreements for which the Firm has elected the\nfair value option (see Note 5). Where\nappropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse\nrepurchase agreements with the same\ncounterparty are reported on a net basis.\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned are\nrecorded at the amount of cash collateral\nadvanced or received. In instances where the\nFirm is the lender in securities-for-\nsecurities transactions and is permitted to\nsell or repledge these securities, the fair\nvalue of the collateral received is reported\nin Trading assets, and the related obligation\nto return the collateral is reported in\nTrading liabilities in the balance sheet.\nSecurities-for-securities transactions where\nthe Firm is the borrower are not included in\nthe balance sheet. In order to manage credit\nexposure arising from these transactions, in\nappropriate circumstances, the Firm enters\ninto master netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with its counterparties. These\nagreements provide the Firm with the right, in\nthe event of a default by the counterparty, to\nnet a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations\nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set\noff collateral held by the Firm against the\nnet amount owed by the counterparty. The\nFirm\u2019s policy is generally to take possession\nof securities purchased or borrowed in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed transactions,\nrespectively, and to receive cash and/or\nsecurities delivered under repurchase\nagreements or securities loaned transactions\n(with rights of rehypothecation). For\ninformation related to offsetting of certain\ncollateralized transactions, see Note 8.\nPremises, Equipment and Capitalized Software\nCosts Premises, equipment and capitalized\nsoftware costs consist of buildings, leasehold\nimprovements, furniture, fixtures, computer\nand communications equipment, power generation\nassets and capitalized software (externally\npurchased and developed for internal use).\nPremises, equipment and capitalized software\ncosts are stated at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization and are included\nin Other assets in the balance sheet.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided by\nthe straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\n                                 \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    90  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nEstimated Useful Life\nof Assets\n                                              \n  in years                         Estimated  \n                                 Useful\u00a0Life  \n  Buildings                               39  \n  Leasehold      term of                      \n  improvemen\u2026    lease to25                   \n  Leasehold      term\u00a0of\u00a0                     \n  improvemen\u2026    lease\u00a0to15                   \n  Furniture                                   \n  and                                      7  \n  fixtures                                    \n  Computer                                    \n  and            3to9                         \n  communicat\u2026                                 \n  equipment                                   \n  Power                                       \n  generation     15to29                       \n  assets                                      \n  Capitalized                                 \n  software       2to10                        \n  costs                                       \n                                              \nPremises, equipment\nand capitalized\nsoftware costs are\ntested for impairment\nwhenever events or\nchanges in\ncircumstances suggest\nthat an asset\u2019s\ncarrying value may not\nbe fully recoverable.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets The Firm tests\ngoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nassets for impairment on an annual basis and\non an interim basis when certain events or\ncircumstances exist. The Firm tests goodwill\nfor impairment at the reporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at the level of or one\nlevel below the Firm\u2019s operating segments. The\nFirm\u2019s operating segments are equivalent to\nits business segments. The Firm tests\nindefinite-lived intangible assets for\nimpairment at the aggregate level of\nmanagement contracts. For both the annual and\ninterim tests, the Firm has the option to\neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment\ntest or (ii) first perform a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value is less\nthan its carrying amount, in which case, the\nquantitative test would be performed. When\nperforming a quantitative impairment test of\ngoodwill, the Firm compares the fair value of\nthe reporting unit with the carrying amount.\nIf the fair value is less than the carrying\namount, the impairment loss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying value over the fair\nvalue, limited to the carrying amount of\ngoodwill within the reporting unit. When\nperforming a quantitative impairment test of\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, the Firm\ncompares the fair value of the assets with the\ncarrying amount. If the fair value is less\nthan the carrying amount, the impairment loss\nis equal to the excess of the carrying value\nover the fair value, limited to the carrying\namount of the assets. The estimated fair\nvalues used in the quantitative impairment\ntests of goodwill and indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are derived based on\nvaluation techniques the Firm believes market\nparticipants would use. The estimated fair\nvalues are generally determined by utilizing a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology or\nmethodologies that incorporate price-to-book\nand price-to-earnings multiples of certain\ncomparable companies for goodwill impairment\ntesting. Intangible assets with a finite life\nare amortized over their estimated useful life\nand are reviewed for impairment on an interim\nbasis to assess whether impairment indicators\nare\n\npresent. Impairment losses are recorded within\nOther expenses in the income statement.\nEarnings per Common Share Basic EPS is\ncomputed by dividing earnings applicable to\nMorgan Stanley common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares\noutstanding for the period. Earnings\napplicable to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders represents net income applicable\nto Morgan Stanley reduced by preferred stock\ndividends. Common shares outstanding include\ncommon stock and vested RSUs where recipients\nhave satisfied the relevant vesting terms.\nDiluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of\nall dilutive securities. Share-based awards,\nincluding awards that pay dividend equivalents\nsubject to vesting, are included in diluted\nshares outstanding (if dilutive) under the\ntreasury stock method. The Firm has granted\nPSUs that vest and convert to shares of common\nstock only if predetermined performance and\nmarket goals are satisfied. Since the issuance\nof the shares is contingent upon the\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, the PSUs\nare included in diluted EPS based on the\nnumber of shares (if any) that would be\nissuable if the reporting date was the end of\nthe performance period. For further\ninformation on diluted earnings (loss) per\ncommon share, see Note 17 to the financial\nstatements. Deferred Compensation Stock-Based\nCompensation The Firm measures compensation\nexpense for stock-based awards at fair value.\nThe Firm determines the fair value of RSUs\n(including PSUs with non-market performance\nconditions) based on the grant-date fair value\nof its common stock, measured as the volume-\nweighted average price on the date of grant\n(\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs not entitled\nto dividends until conversion is measured at\nVWAP reduced by the present value of dividends\nexpected to be paid on the underlying shares\nprior to scheduled conversion date. PSUs that\ncontain market-based conditions are valued\nusing a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the\nvesting period relevant to each separately\nvesting portion of the award. Compensation\nexpense for awards with performance conditions\nis recognized based on the probable outcome of\nthe performance condition at each reporting\ndate. Compensation expense for awards with\nmarket-based conditions is recognized\nirrespective of the probability of the market\ncondition being achieved and is not reversed\nif the market condition is not met. The Firm\naccounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-\nbased awards generally contain clawback and\ncancellation provisions. Certain awards\nprovide the Firm discretion to claw back or\ncancel all or a portion of the award\n                                 \n  91    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nunder specified circumstances. Where award\nterms are considered to be subjective, a grant\ndate cannot be established and the awards are\nsubject to variable accounting which requires\nthat compensation expense for those awards is\nadjusted for changes in the fair value of the\nFirm\u2019s common stock or the relevant model\nvaluation, as appropriate, until conversion,\nexercise or expiration. Following amendments\nto clarify specific subjective award terms in\nthe second quarter of 2023, a grant date for\nthe awards was established such that\ncompensation expense for those awards is no\nlonger adjusted for changes in the fair value\nof the Firm\u2019s common stock. The Firm also\noperates an Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(\u201cESPP\u201d) which allows eligible employees of\nthe Firm to purchase shares of Morgan Stanley\nat a discount. Employee Stock Trusts In\nconnection with certain stock-based\ncompensation plans, the Firm has established\nemployee stock trusts to provide, at its\ndiscretion, common stock voting rights to\ncertain RSU holders. Following the grant of an\nRSU award, when a stock trust is utilized, the\nFirm contributes shares to be held in the\nstock trust until the RSUs convert to common\nshares. The assets of the employee stock\ntrusts are consolidated with those of the Firm\nand are generally accounted for in a manner\nsimilar to treasury stock, where the shares of\ncommon stock outstanding reported in Common\nstock issued to employee stock trusts are\noffset by an equal amount reported in Employee\nstock trusts in the balance sheet. The Firm\nuses the grant-date fair value of stock-based\ncompensation as the basis for recording the\nmovement of the assets to or from the employee\nstock trusts. Changes in the fair value are\nnot recognized as the Firm\u2019s stock-based\ncompensation must be settled by delivery of a\nfixed number of shares of the Firm\u2019s common\nstock. Deferred Cash-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for DCP awards is\ncalculated based on the notional value of the\naward granted, adjusted for changes in the\nfair value of the referenced investments that\nemployees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of deferred\nawards. The Firm invests directly, as a\nprincipal, in financial instruments and other\ninvestments to economically hedge certain of\nits obligations under its DCP. Changes in the\nvalue of such investments are recorded in\nTrading revenues and Investments revenues.\nAlthough changes in compensation expense\nresulting from changes in the fair value of\nthe referenced investments will generally be\noffset by changes in the fair value of\ninvestments made by the Firm, there is\ntypically a timing difference between the\nimmediate recognition of gains and losses on\nthe Firm\u2019s investments and the deferred\nrecognition of the related compensation\nexpense over the vesting period. Retirement-\nEligible Employee Compensation For year-end\nstock-based awards and DCP awards anticipated\nto be granted to retirement-eligible employees\nunder award terms that do not contain a future\nservice requirement, the Firm accrues the\nestimated cost of the awards over the course\nof the calendar year preceding the grant date,\nwhich reflects the period over which the\ncompensation is earned. Carried Interest\nCompensation The Firm generally recognizes\ncompensation expense for any portion of\ncarried interest (both realized and\nunrealized) that is allocated to employees.\nFor information on performance-based fees in\nthe form of carried interest, which are\ndirectly related to carried interest\ncompensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014Carried\nInterest\u201d herein. Income Taxes Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based upon\nthe temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and income tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using currently enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The\neffect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in\nincome tax expense (benefit) in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. Such effects\nare recorded in Provision for income taxes\nregardless of where deferred taxes were\noriginally recorded. The Firm recognizes net\ndeferred tax assets to the extent that it\nbelieves these assets are more likely than not\nto be realized. In making such a\ndetermination, the Firm considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence,\nincluding future reversals of existing taxable\ntemporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and\nresults of recent operations. When performing\nthe assessment, the Firm considers all types\nof deferred tax assets in combination with\neach other, regardless of the origin of the\nunderlying temporary difference. If a deferred\ntax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. If the\nFirm subsequently determines that it would be\nable to realize deferred tax assets in excess\nof their net recorded amount, it would make an\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes. The Firm recognizes tax\nexpense associated with Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income as it is incurred as part of the\ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period. Uncertain tax\npositions are recorded on the basis of a two-\nstep process, whereby (i) the Firm determines\nwhether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis\nof the technical merits of the position and\n(ii) for those tax positions that meet this\nthreshold, the Firm recognizes the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon ultimate settlement\nwith the related tax authority.

Accounting\nUpdates Adopted in\n2024 Segment Reporting\nThe Firm adopted the\nSegment Reporting -\nImprovements to\nReportable Segment\nDisclosures accounting\nupdate\nretrospectively,\neffective January 1,\n2024. This accounting\nupdate requires\nadditional reportable\nsegment disclosures on\nan annual and interim\nbasis, primarily about\nsignificant segment\nexpenses and other\nsegment items that are\nregularly provided to\nthe chief operating\ndecision maker and\nincluded within the\nreported measure of\nsegment profit or\nloss. See Note 22 to\nthe financial\nstatements for\ndisclosures on the\nFirm\u2019s reportable\nsegments. Investments\n- Tax Credit\nStructures The Firm\nadopted the\nInvestments - Equity\nMethod and Joint\nVentures - Tax Credit\nStructures accounting\nupdate on January 1,\n2024 using the\nmodified retrospective\nmethod. This\naccounting update\npermits an election to\naccount for tax equity\ninvestments using the\nproportional\namortization method if\ncertain conditions are\nmet. Under the\nproportional\namortization method,\nthe initial cost of\nthe investment is\namortized in\nproportion to the\nincome tax credits and\nother income tax\nbenefits received and\nrecognized net in the\nincome statement as a\ncomponent of provision\nfor income taxes. The\nupdate requires a\nseparate accounting\npolicy election to be\nmade for each tax\ncredit program.\nAdditional disclosures\nare required regarding\n(i) the nature of our\ntax equity investments\nand (ii) the effect of\nour tax equity\ninvestments and\nrelated income tax\ncredits on the\nfinancial condition\nand results of\noperations (see Note\n11). The adoption\nresulted in a decrease\nto Retained earnings\nof $ 60million as of\nJanuary 1, 2024, net\nof tax, and a\ncorresponding\nreduction to Other\nassets.\n\nAccounting Update\nAdopted in 2022\nReference Rate Reform\nThe Firm has adopted\nthe Reference Rate\nReform accounting\nupdate, which extends\nthe period of time\nentities can utilize\nthe reference rate\nreform relief guidance\nfrom December 31, 2022\nto December 31, 2024.\nThe relief provides\noptional expedients\nand exceptions for\napplying generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples to\ncontracts, hedging\nrelationships and\nother transactions\nthat reference LIBOR\nor other interest rate\nbenchmarks for which\nthe referenced rate is\nexpected to be\ndiscontinued or\nreplaced. The Firm is\napplying the\naccounting relief as\nrelevant contract and\nhedge accounting\nrelationship\nmodifications are made\nduring the course of\nthe reference rate\nreform transition\nperiod. There was no\nimpact to the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements\nupon issuance of this\naccounting standard\nupdate. 3.

When\nevaluating the comparable instruments for use\nin the valuation of each security, security\ncollateral-specific attributes, including\npayment priority, credit enhancement levels,\ntype of collateral, delinquency rates and loss\nseverity, are considered. In addition, for\nRMBS borrowers, FICO scores and the level of\ndocumentation for the loan are considered. \u2022\nMarket standard cash flow models may be\nutilized to model the specific collateral\ncomposition and cash flow structure of each\ntransaction. Key inputs to these models are\nmarket spreads, forecasted credit losses, and\ndefault and prepayment rates for each asset\ncategory. \u2022 Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS\nindices are used as an additional data point\nfor benchmarking purposes or to price outright\nindex positions.

The valuation of loans and\nlending commitments also takes into account\nfee income that is considered an attribute of\nthe contract. \u2022 Fair value of mortgage loans\nis determined using observable prices based on\ntransactional data or third-party pricing for\ncomparable instruments, when available. \u2022\nWhere position-specific external prices are\nnot observable, fair value is estimated based\non benchmarking to prices and rates observed\nin the primary market for similar loan or\nborrower types or based on the present value\nof expected future cash flows using the Firm\u2019s\nbest available estimates of the key\nassumptions, including forecasted credit\nlosses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves\nand discount rates commensurate with the risks\ninvolved or a methodology that utilizes the\ncapital structure and credit spreads of recent\ncomparable securitization transactions. \u2022 Fair\nvalue of equity margin loans is determined by\ndiscounting future interest cash flows, net of\npotential losses resulting from large downward\nprice movements of the underlying margin loan\ncollateral.

In the case of more established\nderivative products, the pricing models used\nby the Firm are widely accepted by the\nfinancial services industry. \u2022 More complex\nOTC derivative products are typically less\nliquid and require more judgment in the\nimplementation of the valuation technique\nsince direct trading activity or quotes are\nunobservable. This includes certain types of\ninterest rate derivatives with both volatility\nand correlation exposure, equity, commodity or\nforeign currency derivatives that are either\nlonger-dated or include exposure to multiple\nunderlyings, and credit derivatives, including\nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities and basket CDS. Where required\ninputs are unobservable, relationships to\nobservable data points, based on historical\nand/or implied observations, may be employed\nas a technique to estimate the model input\nvalues.

A single amount is\ndisclosed for range\nand average when there\nis no significant\ndifference between the\nminimum, maximum and\naverage. Amounts\nrepresent weighted\naverages except where\nsimple averages and\nthe median of the\ninputs are more\nrelevant.\n\n2.

The\nlevel of aggregation\nand breadth of\nproducts cause the\nrange of inputs to be\nwide and not evenly\ndistributed across the\ninventory of financial\ninstruments. Further,\nthe range of\nunobservable inputs\nmay differ across\nfirms in the financial\nservices industry\nbecause of diversity\nin the types of\nproducts included in\neach firm\u2019s inventory.\nGenerally, there are\nno predictable\nrelationships between\nmultiple significant\nunobservable inputs\nattributable to a\ngiven valuation\ntechnique. During\n2024, there were no\nsignificant revisions\nmade to the\ndescriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s significant\nunobservable inputs.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a higher (lower)\nfair value.\n                                  \n  101    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n\u2022 Comparable Bond or\nLoan Price. A pricing\ninput used when prices\nfor the identical\ninstrument are not\navailable. Significant\nsubjectivity may be\ninvolved when fair\nvalue is determined\nusing pricing data\navailable for\ncomparable\ninstruments. Valuation\nusing comparable\ninstruments can be\ndone by calculating an\nimplied yield (or\nspread over a liquid\nbenchmark) from the\nprice of a comparable\nbond or loan, then\nadjusting that yield\n(or spread) to derive\na value for the bond\nor loan. The\nadjustment to yield\n(or spread) should\naccount for relevant\ndifferences in the\nbonds or loans, such\nas maturity or credit\nquality.\nAlternatively, a\nprice-to-price basis\ncan be assumed between\nthe comparable\ninstrument and the\nbond or loan being\nvalued in order to\nestablish the value of\nthe bond or loan. \u2022\nComparable Equity\nPrice. A price derived\nfrom equity raises,\nshare buybacks and\nexternal bid levels,\netc. A discount or\npremium may be\nincluded in the fair\nvalue estimate. \u2022\nContingency\nProbability.\nProbability associated\nwith the realization\nof an underlying event\nupon which the value\nof an asset is\ncontingent. \u2022 EBITDA\nMultiple/Exit\nMultiple. The ratio of\nenterprise value to\nEBITDA, where\nenterprise value is\nthe aggregate value of\nequity and debt minus\ncash and cash\nequivalents. The\nEBITDA multiple\nreflects the value of\na company in terms of\nits full-year EBITDA,\nwhereas the exit\nmultiple reflects the\nvalue of a company in\nterms of its full-year\nexpected EBITDA at\nexit. Either multiple\nallows comparison\nbetween companies from\nan operational\nperspective as the\neffect of capital\nstructure, taxation\nand depreciation/amort\nization is excluded.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a lower (higher)\nfair value. \u2022 Cash-\nSynthetic Basis. The\nmeasure of the price\ndifferential between\ncash financial\ninstruments and their\nsynthetic derivative-\nbased equivalents. The\nrange disclosed in the\nprevious table\nsignifies the number\nof points by which the\nsynthetic bond\nequivalent price is\nhigher than the quoted\nprice of the\nunderlying cash bonds.\n\u2022 Funding Spread. The\ncost of borrowing\ndefined as the\nincremental spread\nover the OIS rate for\na specific collateral\nrate (which refers to\nthe rate applicable to\na specific type of\nsecurity pledged as\ncollateral). \u2022 Loss\nGiven Default. Amount\nexpressed as a\npercentage of par that\nis the expected loss\nwhen a credit event\noccurs. \u2022 Margin Loan\nRate. The annualized\nrate that reflects the\npossibility of losses\nas a result of\nmovements in the price\nof the underlying\nmargin loan\ncollateral. The rate\nis calibrated from the\ndiscount rate, credit\nspreads and/or\nvolatility measures.\n\n\u2022 WACC. WACC\nrepresents the\ntheoretical rate of\nreturn required to\ndebt and equity\ninvestors. The WACC is\nused in a discounted\ncash flow model that\ncalculates the value\nof the equity. The\nmodel assumes that the\ncash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections,\nare fully reflected in\nthe current equity\nvalue, while the debt\nto equity ratio is\nheld constant. An\nincrease (decrease) to\nthe following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin an impact to the\nfair value, but the\nmagnitude and\ndirection of the\nimpact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is\nlong or short the\nexposure. \u2022\nCorrelation. A pricing\ninput where the payoff\nis driven by more than\none underlying risk.\nCorrelation is a\nmeasure of the\nrelationship between\nthe movement of two\nvariables (i.e., how\nthe change in one\nvariable influences a\nchange in the other\nvariable). \u2022 Credit\nSpread. The credit\nspread reflects the\nadditional net yield\nan investor can earn\nfrom a security with\nmore credit risk\nrelative to one with\nless credit risk. The\ncredit spread of a\nparticular security is\noften quoted in\nrelation to the yield\non a credit risk-free\nbenchmark security or\nreference rate. \u2022\nInterest Rate Curve.\nThe term structure of\ninterest rates\n(relationship between\ninterest rates and the\ntime to maturity) and\na market\u2019s measure of\nfuture interest rates\nat the time of\nobservation. An\ninterest rate curve is\nused to set interest\nrate and foreign\nexchange derivative\ncash flows and is a\npricing input used in\nthe discounting of any\nOTC derivative cash\nflow. \u2022 Volatility.\nThe measure of\nvariability in\npossible returns for\nan instrument given\nhow much that\ninstrument changes in\nvalue over time.\nVolatility is a\npricing input for\noptions, and,\ngenerally, the lower\nthe volatility, the\nless risky the option.\nThe level of\nvolatility used in the\nvaluation of a\nparticular option\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including the\nnature of the risk\nunderlying that\noption, the tenor and\nthe strike price of\nthe option. \u2022\nVolatility Skew. The\nmeasure of the\ndifference in implied\nvolatility for options\nwith identical\nunderliers and expiry\ndates but with\ndifferent strikes.

A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties for\nthese derivatives are\nbanks, broker-dealers,\nand insurance and\nother financial\ninstitutions. The fair\nvalue amounts as shown\nin the previous tables\nare prior to cash\ncollateral or\ncounterparty netting.\nThe purchase of credit\nprotection does not\nrepresent the sole\nmanner in which the\nFirm risk manages its\nexposure to credit\nderivatives. The Firm\nmanages its exposure\nto these derivative\ncontracts through a\nvariety of risk\nmitigation strategies,\nwhich include managing\nthe credit and\ncorrelation risk\nacross single-name,\nnon-tranched indices\nand baskets, tranched\nindices and baskets,\nand cash positions.\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\nestablished for credit\nderivatives, and\nmarket risk measures\nare routinely\nmonitored against\nthese limits. The Firm\nmay also recover\namounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligation delivered\nto the Firm under CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS\nprotects the buyer\nagainst the loss of\nprincipal on a bond or\nloan in case of a\ndefault by the issuer.\nThe protection buyer\npays a periodic\npremium (generally\nquarterly) over the\nlife of the contract\nand is protected for\nthe period. The Firm,\nin turn, performs\nunder a CDS if a\ncredit event as\ndefined under the\ncontract occurs.\nTypical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay and\nrestructuring of the\nobligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.\nIndex and basket CDS\nare products where\ncredit protection is\nprovided on a\nportfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally,\nin the event of a\ndefault on one of the\nunderlying names, the\nFirm pays a pro rata\nportion of the total\nnotional amount of the\nCDS. The Firm also\nenters into tranched\nindex and basket CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection is provided\non a particular\nportion of the\nportfolio loss\ndistribution. The most\njunior tranches cover\ninitial defaults, and\nonce losses exceed the\nnotional of the\n                                  \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    108  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ntranche, they are\npassed on to the next\nmost senior tranche in\nthe capital structure.\nOther Credit\nContracts. The Firm\nhas invested in CLNs\nand CDOs, which are\nhybrid instruments\ncontaining embedded\nderivatives, in which\ncredit protection has\nbeen sold to the\nissuer of the note.

Under\nthese arrangements,\nthe Firm receives\ncollateral, which\nincludes U.S.\ngovernment and agency\nsecurities, other\nsovereign government\nobligations, corporate\nand other debt, and\ncorporate equities.\nMargin loans are\ncollateralized by\ncustomer-owned\nsecurities held by the\nFirm. The Firm\nmonitors required\nmargin levels and\nestablished credit\nterms daily and,\npursuant to such\nguidelines, requires\ncustomers to deposit\nadditional collateral,\nor reduce positions,\nwhen necessary. Margin\nloans are extended on\na demand basis and\ngenerally are not\ncommitted facilities.\nFactors considered in\nthe review of margin\nloans are the amount\nof the loan, the\nintended purpose, the\ndegree of leverage\nbeing employed in the\naccount and the amount\nof collateral, as well\nas an overall\nevaluation of the\nportfolio to ensure\nproper diversification\nor, in the case of\nconcentrated\npositions, appropriate\nliquidity of the\nunderlying collateral\nor potential hedging\nstrategies to reduce\nrisk. Underlying\ncollateral for margin\nloans is reviewed with\nrespect to the\nliquidity of the\nproposed collateral\npositions, valuation\nof securities,\nhistoric trading\nrange, volatility\nanalysis and an\nevaluation of industry\nconcentrations. For\nthese transactions,\nadherence to the\nFirm\u2019s collateral\npolicies significantly\nlimits its credit\nexposure in the event\nof a customer default.\nThe Firm may request\nadditional margin\ncollateral from\ncustomers, if\nappropriate, and, if\nnecessary, may sell\nsecurities that have\nnot been paid for or\npurchase securities\nsold but not delivered\nfrom customers.

For Corporate,\nSecured lending\nfacilities and Other\nloans, credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the evaluation\nof financial\nstatements, assessment\nof leverage,\nliquidity, capital\nstrength, asset\ncomposition and\nquality, market\ncapitalization and\naccess to capital\nmarkets, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements,\nand the adequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable. The CRM\nalso evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, obligor\u2019s\nmanagement and other\nfactors that could\naffect an obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile. For\nCommercial real estate\nloans, the credit\nevaluation is focused\non property and\ntransaction metrics,\nincluding property\ntype, LTV ratio,\noccupancy levels, debt\nservice ratio,\nprevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\nFor Residential real\nestate and Securities-\nbased loans, the\ninitial credit\nevaluation typically\nincludes, but is not\nlimited to, review of\nthe obligor\u2019s income,\nnet worth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand credit bureau\ninformation.\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nresidential real\nestate loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level.\nSecurities-based loan\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis.

These\namounts also include\ncommitments to enter\ninto certain\ncollateralized\nfinancing\ntransactions.\nSince commitments\nassociated with these\ninstruments may expire\nunused, the amounts\nshown do not\nnecessarily reflect\nthe actual future cash\nfunding requirements.\n\nTypes of Commitments\n\nLending Commitments.\nLending commitments\nprimarily represent\nthe notional amount of\nlegally binding\nobligations to provide\nfunding to clients for\ndifferent types of\nloan transactions. For\nsyndications that are\nled by the Firm, the\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed are net of the\namounts agreed to by\ncounterparties that\nwill participate in\nthe syndication. For\nsyndications that the\nFirm participates in\nand does not lead,\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed include only\nthe amount that the\nFirm expects it will\nbe allocated from the\nlead syndicate bank.\nDue to the nature of\nthe Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder the commitments,\nthese amounts include\ncertain commitments\nparticipated to third\nparties.\n\nForward-Starting\nSecured Financing\nReceivables. These\namounts include\nsecurities purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed that the Firm\nhas entered into prior\nto the balance sheet\ndate that will settle\nafter the balance\nsheet date. These\ntransactions are\nprimarily secured by\ncollateral from U.S.\ngovernment agency\nsecurities and other\nsovereign government\nobligations when they\nare funded.\n\nCentral Counterparty.\nThese commitments\nrelate to the Firm\u2019s\nmembership in certain\nclearinghouses and are\ncontingent upon the\ndefault of a\nclearinghouse member\nor other stress\nevents. Underwriting\nCommitments. The Firm\nprovides underwriting\ncommitments in\nconnection with its\ncapital raising\nsources to a diverse\ngroup of corporate and\nother institutional\nclients. Investment\nActivities. The Firm\nsponsors several non-\nconsolidated\ninvestment management\nfunds for third-party\ninvestors where it\ntypically acts as\ngeneral partner of,\nand investment adviser\nto, these funds and\ntypically commits to\ninvest a minority of\nthe capital of such\nfunds, with\nsubscribing third-\nparty investors\ncontributing the\nmajority. The Firm has\ncontractual capital\ncommitments,\nguarantees and\ncounterparty\narrangements with\nrespect to these\ninvestment management\nfunds. Letters of\nCredit and Other\nFinancial Guarantees.\nThe Firm has\noutstanding letters of\ncredit and other\nfinancial guarantees\nissued by third-party\nbanks to certain of\nthe Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties. The\nFirm is contingently\nliable for these\nletters of credit and\nother financial\nguarantees, which are\nprimarily used to\nprovide collateral for\nsecurities and\ncommodities traded and\nto satisfy various\nmargin requirements in\nlieu of depositing\ncash or securities\nwith these\ncounterparties.\nGuarantees\n                                              \n           At                                 \n         Dec\u2026                                 \n          31,                                 \n         2024                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         Max\u2026                                 \n         Pot\u2026                                 \n         Pay\u2026                           Car\u2026  \n           of                           Amo\u2026  \n         Obl\u2026                           Ass\u2026  \n           by                           (Li\u2026  \n         Yea\u2026                                 \n           to                                 \n         Mat\u2026                                 \n  $      Less                    Ov\u2026          \n  in     than     1-3     3-5      5          \n  mi\u2026       1                                 \n  No\u2026    1,1\u2026    626\u2026    152\u2026    46\u2026    -40\u2026  \n  de\u2026                                         \n  St\u2026                                         \n  le\u2026                                         \n  of                                          \n  cr\u2026                                         \n  and    1,5\u2026     732    1,0\u2026    2,\u2026      18  \n  ot\u2026                                         \n  fi\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  is\u2026                                         \n  Li\u2026    2,4\u2026       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       2  \n  fa\u2026                                         \n  Wh\u2026                                         \n  lo\u2026      24      63       \u2014    23\u2026       \u2014  \n  sa\u2026                                         \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Se\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014    87\u2026       \u2014  \n  and                                         \n  wa\u2026                                         \n  Ge\u2026                                         \n  pa\u2026     180     133      53     35     -98  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n  Cl\u2026                                         \n  cl\u2026     816       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       \u2014  \n  gu\u2026                                         \n                                              \n1. The carrying amounts of derivative\ncontracts that meet the accounting definition\nof a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For\nfurther information on derivative contracts,\nsee Note 6.\n2. These amounts include certain issued\nstandby letters of credit participated to\nthird parties, totaling $ 0.6billion of\nnotional and collateral/recourse, due to the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s obligations under these\narrangements.\n3. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying\namount of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees issued includes an\nallowance for credit losses of $ 56million.\n4. Related to commercial, residential mortgage\nand asset backed securitizations.\nTypes of Guarantees\nNon-Credit\nDerivatives. Certain\nderivative contracts\nmeet the accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, including\ncertain written\noptions, contingent-\nforward contracts and\nCDS (see Note 6\nregarding credit\nderivatives in which\nthe Firm has sold\ncredit protection to\nthe counterparty which\nare excluded from the\nprevious table). For\nnon-credit derivative\ncontracts that meet\nthe accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, the\nnotional amount is\nused as the maximum\npotential payout for\ncertain derivative\ncontracts, such as\nwritten interest rate\ncaps and written\nforeign\n                                  \n  121    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ncurrency options. The Firm evaluates\ncollateral requirements for all derivatives,\nincluding derivatives that do not meet the\naccounting definition of a guarantee. For the\neffects of cash collateral and counterparty\nnetting, see Note 6. In certain situations,\ncollateral may be held by the Firm for those\ncontracts that meet the definition of a\nguarantee. Generally, the Firm sets collateral\nrequirements by counterparty so that the\ncollateral covers various transactions and\nproducts and is not allocated specifically to\nindividual contracts. Also, the Firm may\nrecover amounts related to the underlying\nasset delivered to the Firm under the\nderivative contract. Standby Letters of Credit\nand Other Financial Guarantees Issued.\nGenerally, in connection with its lending\nbusinesses, the Firm provides standby letters\nof credit and other financial guarantees to\ncounterparties. Such arrangements represent\nobligations to make payments to third parties\nif the counterparty fails to fulfill its\nobligation under a borrowing arrangement or\nother contractual obligation. A majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s standby letters of credit are\nprovided on behalf of counterparties that are\ninvestment grade. If the counterparty fails to\nfulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm\nhas access to collateral or recourse that\nwould approximate its obligation. Liquidity\nFacilities. The Firm has entered into\nliquidity facilities with SPEs and other\ncounterparties, whereby the Firm is required\nto make certain payments if losses or defaults\noccur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity\nprovider to municipal bond securitization SPEs\nand for stand-alone municipal bonds in which\nthe holders of beneficial interests issued by\nthese SPEs or the holders of the individual\nbonds, respectively, have the right to tender\ntheir interests for purchase by the Firm on\nspecified dates at a specified price. The Firm\noften may have recourse to the underlying\nassets held by the SPEs in the event payments\nare required under such liquidity facilities,\nas well as make-whole or recourse provisions\nwith the trust sponsors. The recourse amount\noften exceeds the maximum potential payout\namount of the guarantee. Substantially all of\nthe underlying assets in the SPEs are\ninvestment grade. Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond\ntrusts are classified as derivatives. Whole\nLoan Sales Guarantees. The Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain whole loan sales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may be required to\nrepurchase such assets or make other payments\nrelated to such assets if such representations\nand warranties are breached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential payout related to such\nrepresentations and warranties is equal to the\ncurrent UPB of such loans. Since the Firm no\nlonger services these loans, it has no\ninformation on the current UPB of those loans,\nand, accordingly, the amount included in the\nprevious table represents the UPB at the time\nof the whole loan sale or at the time when the\nFirm last serviced any of those loans. The\ncurrent UPB balances could be substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout amount\nincluded in the previous table. The related\nliability primarily relates to sales of loans\nto the federal mortgage agencies.\nSecuritization Representations and Warranties.\nAs part of the Firm\u2019s Institutional Securities\nbusiness segment\u2019s securitizations and related\nactivities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain assets transferred in securitization\ntransactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent\nand nature of the representations and\nwarranties, if any, vary among different\nsecuritizations. Under certain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be required to repurchase certain\nassets or make other payments related to such\nassets if such representations and warranties\nare breached. The maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments the Firm could be required to\nmake would be equal to the current outstanding\nbalances of, or losses associated with, the\nassets subject to breaches of such\nrepresentations and warranties. The amount\nincluded in the previous table for the maximum\npotential payout includes the current UPB or\nhistorical losses where known and the UPB at\nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not\nknown. General Partner Guarantees. As a\ngeneral partner in certain investment\nmanagement funds, the Firm receives certain\ndistributions from the partnerships when the\nreturn exceeds specified performance targets\naccording to the provisions of the partnership\nagreements. The Firm may be required to return\nall or a portion of such distributions to the\nlimited partners in the event the limited\npartners do not achieve a certain return as\nspecified in the various partnership\nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees. The Firm is a\nsponsoring member of the Government Securities\nDivision of the FICC\u2019s Sponsored Clearing\nModel. Clients of the Firm, as sponsored\nmembers, can transact in overnight and term\nsecurities repurchase and resale agreements,\nwhich are cleared through the FICC. As\nsponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the\nFICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its clients\u2019 obligations. In\n2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing model was\nupdated such that the Firm could be\nresponsible for liquidation of a sponsored\nmember\u2019s account and guarantees any resulting\nloss to the FICC in the event the sponsored\nmember fails to fully pay any net liquidation\namount due from the sponsored member to the\nFICC. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum\npotential payout amount reflects the total of\nthe estimated net liquidation amounts for\nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes\ncredit exposure under this guarantee by\nobtaining a security interest in its sponsored\nmember clients\u2019 collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member\ntransactions. Therefore, the Firm\u2019s exposure\nis estimated to be an amount substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout\namount. The collateral amount in which the\nFirm has a security interest is approximately\nequal to the maximum potential payout amount\nof the guarantee.\n                                  \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    122  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nOther Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal\ncourse of business, the Firm provides\nguarantees and indemnifications in a variety\nof transactions. These provisions generally\nare standard contractual terms. Certain of\nthese guarantees and indemnifications are\ndescribed below: \u2022 Indemnities . The Firm\nprovides standard indemnities to\ncounterparties for certain contingent\nexposures and taxes, including U.S. and\nforeign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities\nand stock lending transactions, certain\nannuity products and other financial\narrangements. These indemnity payments could\nbe required based on a change in the tax laws,\na change in interpretation of applicable tax\nrulings or a change in factual circumstances.\nCertain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The Firm\nmay also provide indemnities when it sells a\nbusiness or assets to a third-party, pursuant\nto which it indemnifies the third-party for\nlosses incurred on assets acquired or\nliabilities assumed or due to actions taken by\nthe Firm prior to the sale of the business or\nassets. The Firm expects the risk of loss\nassociated with indemnities related to the\nsale of businesses or assets to be remote. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Firm could be required to make under\nthese indemnifications cannot be estimated. \u2022\nMarket Value Guarantees. Market value\nguarantees are issued to guarantee timely\npayment of a specified return to investors in\ncertain affordable housing tax credit funds.\nThese guarantees are designed to return an\ninvestor\u2019s contribution to a fund and the\ninvestor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax credits\nexpected to be generated by a fund. \u2022\nExchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The\nFirm is a member of various exchanges and\nclearinghouses that trade and clear securities\nand/or derivative contracts. Associated with\nits membership, the Firm may be required to\npay a certain amount as determined by the\nexchange or the clearinghouse in case of a\ndefault of any of its members or pay a\nproportionate share of the financial\nobligations of another member that may default\non its obligations to the exchange or the\nclearinghouse. While the rules governing\ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse\nmemberships and the forms of these guarantees\nmay vary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder these rules would arise only if the\nexchange or clearinghouse had previously\nexhausted its resources. In addition, some\nclearinghouse rules require members to assume\na proportionate share of losses resulting from\nthe clearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee\nfund contributions and initial margin and of\nother losses unrelated to the default of a\nclearing member, if such losses exceed the\nspecified resources allocated for such purpose\nby the clearinghouse. The maximum potential\npayout under these rules cannot be estimated.\nThe Firm has not recorded any contingent\nliability in its financial statements for\nthese agreements and believes that any\npotential requirement to make payments under\nthese agreements is remote. \u2022 Futures and\nOver-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing. The\nFirm provides clearing services on central\ncounterparty clearinghouses (\u201cCCPs\u201d) for\nclients that need to clear exchange-traded and\nOTC derivatives contracts with CCPs. The Firm\nacts as an agent in its role as clearing\nmember for these client transactions. As such,\nthe Firm does not reflect the underlying\nexchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts\nin its Consolidated Financial Statements. See\nNote 6 for a discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nderivatives activities that are reflected in\nits Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is responsible\nto the CCP for the performance of its clients,\ncollects cash and securities collateral\n(margin) as well as any settlement amounts due\nfrom or to clients, and remits them to the\nrelevant CCP or client in whole or part. There\nare two types of margin: (1) variation margin\nis posted on a daily basis based on the value\nof clients\u2019 derivative contracts and (2)\ninitial margin is posted at inception of a\nderivative contract, generally on the basis of\nthe potential changes in the variation margin\nrequirement for the contract.\n\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to\nthe risk of nonperformance by its clients to\nCCPs but is not liable to clients for the\nperformance of the CCPs. Where possible, the\nFirm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client\nthrough the collection of appropriate amounts\nof margin at inception and throughout the life\nof the transactions. In the event of\nnonperformance by a client, the Firm would\nclose out the client\u2019s positions and access\navailable margin. The CCP would utilize any\nmargin it holds to make itself whole, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by\nthe Firm as a clearing member.It is difficult\nto estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible\nexposure through its role as a clearing member\nas it depends on the nature and volume of\nclient's future transactions, market\nconditions and potential client defaults.\nHowever, based upon historical experience, the\nFirm\u2019s exposure is significantly mitigated by\nthe credit risk mitigants available to the\nFirm. As a result, management believes that\nthe risk of material loss to the Firm is\nexpected to be remote. \u2022 Merger and\nAcquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from\ntime to time, in its role as investment\nbanking advisor be required to provide\nguarantees in connection with certain European\nmerger and acquisition transactions. If\nrequired by the regulating authorities, the\nFirm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in\nthe transaction has or will have sufficient\nfunds to complete the transaction and would\nthen be required to make the acquisition\npayments in the event the acquirer\u2019s funds are\ninsufficient at the completion date of the\ntransaction. These arrangements generally\ncover the time frame from the transaction\noffer date to its closing date\n                                  \n  123    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nand, therefore, are\ngenerally short term\nin nature. The Firm\nbelieves the\nlikelihood of any\npayment by the Firm\nunder these\narrangements is remote\ngiven the level of its\ndue diligence in its\nrole as investment\nbanking advisor. In\naddition, in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, the Firm\nguarantees the debt\nand/or certain trading\nobligations (including\nobligations associated\nwith derivatives,\nforeign exchange\ncontracts and the\nsettlement of physical\ncommodities) of\ncertain subsidiaries.\nThese guarantees\ngenerally are entity\nor product specific\nand are required by\ninvestors or trading\ncounterparties. The\nactivities of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries\ncovered by these\nguarantees (including\nany related debt or\ntrading obligations)\nare included in the\nfinancial statements.\nFinance Subsidiary The\nParent Company fully\nand unconditionally\nguarantees the\nsecurities issued by\nMorgan Stanley Finance\nLLC, a wholly owned\nfinance subsidiary. No\nother subsidiary of\nthe Parent Company\nguarantees these\nsecurities.\nContingencies Legal In\naddition to the\nmatters described\nbelow, in the normal\ncourse of business,\nthe Firm has been\nnamed, from time to\ntime, as a defendant\nin various legal\nactions, including\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with its\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the third-party\nentities that are, or\nwould otherwise be,\nthe primary defendants\nin such cases are\nbankrupt, in financial\ndistress, or may not\nhonor applicable\nindemnification\nobligations. These\nactions have included,\nbut are not limited\nto, antitrust claims,\nclaims under various\nfalse claims act\nstatutes, and matters\narising from our\nwealth management\nbusinesses, sales and\ntrading businesses,\nand our activities in\nthe capital markets.\nThe Firm is also\ninvolved, from time to\ntime, in other\nreviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental or\nother regulatory\nagencies regarding the\nFirm\u2019s business, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\nfinancing, prime\nbrokerage, market-\nmaking activities,\ninvestment banking\nadvisory services,\ncapital markets\nactivities, financial\nproducts or offerings\nsponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, wealth\nand investment\nmanagement services,\nand accounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties,\ndisgorgement,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ninjunctions,\nlimitations on our\nability to conduct\ncertain business, or\nother relief.\n\nThe Firm contests\nliability and/or the\namount of damages as\nappropriate in each\npending matter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss or the range of\nloss, the Firm accrues\nan estimated loss by a\ncharge to income,\nincluding with respect\nto certain of the\nindividual proceedings\nor investigations\ndescribed below.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions        2024       2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Legal        $   106    $   488    $   443  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s legal\nexpenses can, and may\nin the future,\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\nor regulatory agency\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm. In many legal\nproceedings and\ninvestigations, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where the Firm\nhas determined that a\nloss is probable or\nreasonably possible or\nan exposure to loss or\nrange of loss exists\nin excess of the\nliability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, the Firm\nmay be unable to\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of the loss\nor range of loss. It\nis particularly\ndifficult to determine\nif a loss is probable\nor reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, where the\nfactual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\nforfeiture,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved in an\ninvestigation or\nproceeding before a\ndetermination can be\nmade that a loss or\nadditional loss (or\nrange of loss or range\nof additional loss) is\nprobable or reasonably\npossible, or to\nestimate the amount of\nloss, including\nthrough potentially\nlengthy discovery or\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification,\nthe calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. The Firm has\nidentified below any\nindividual proceedings\nor investigations\nwhere the Firm\nbelieves a material\nloss to be reasonably\npossible. In certain\nlegal proceedings in\nwhich the Firm has\ndetermined that a\nmaterial loss is\nreasonably possible,\nthe Firm is unable to\nreasonably estimate\nthe loss or range of\nloss. There are other\nmatters in which the\nFirm has determined a\nloss or range of loss\nto be reasonably\npossible, but the Firm\ndoes not believe,\nbased on current\nknowledge and after\nconsultation with\ncounsel, that such\nlosses could have a\nmaterial adverse\neffect on the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements\nas a whole, although\nthe outcome of such\nproceedings or\ninvestigations may\nsignificantly impact\nthe Firm\u2019s business or\nresults of operations\nfor any particular\nreporting period, or\ncause significant\nreputational harm.\n                                  \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    124  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nWhile the Firm has identified below certain\nproceedings or investigations that the Firm\nbelieves to be material, individually or\ncollectively, there can be no assurance that\nmaterial losses will not be incurred from\nclaims that have not yet been asserted or\nthose where potential losses have not yet been\ndetermined to be probable or reasonably\npossible. Antitrust Related Matters The Firm\nand other financial institutions are\nresponding to a number of governmental\ninvestigations and civil litigation matters\nrelated to allegations of anticompetitive\nconduct in various aspects of the financial\nservices industry, including the matters\ndescribed below. Beginning in February of\n2016, the Firm was named as a defendant in\nmultiple purported antitrust class actions now\nconsolidated into a single proceeding in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York (\u201cSDNY\u201d) styled In Re:\nInterest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litigation .\nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm,\ntogether with a number of other financial\ninstitution defendants, violated U.S. and New\nYork state antitrust laws from 2008 through\nDecember of 2016 in connection with alleged\nefforts to prevent the development of\nelectronic exchange-based platforms for\ninterest rate swaps trading. Complaints were\nfiled both on behalf of a purported class of\ninvestors who purchased interest rate swaps\nfrom defendants, as well as on behalf of\nthreeoperators of swap execution facilities\nthat allegedly were thwarted by the defendants\nin their efforts to develop such platforms.\nThe consolidated complaints seek, inter alia,\ncertification of the investor class of\nplaintiffs and treble damages. On July 28,\n2017, the court granted in part and denied in\npart the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\ncomplaints. On December 15, 2023, the court\ndenied the class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification. On December 29, 2023, the class\nplaintiffs petitioned the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit for leave to\nappeal that decision. On February 28, 2024,\nthe parties reached an agreement in principle\nto settle the class claims. On July 11, 2024,\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the\nsettlement. The Firm is a defendant in\nthreeantitrust class action complaints which\nhave been consolidated into one proceeding in\nthe United States District Court for the SDNY\nunder the caption City of Philadelphia, et al.\nv. Bank of America Corporation, et al.\nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm,\ntogether with a number of other financial\ninstitution defendants, violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and relevant state laws in\nconnection with alleged efforts to\nartificially inflate interest rates for\nVariable Rate Demand Obligations (\u201cVRDO\u201d). The\nconsolidated complaint seeks, inter alia,\ncertification of the class of plaintiffs and\ntreble damages. The complaint was filed on\nbehalf of a class of municipal issuers of VRDO\nfor which defendants served as remarketing\nagent. On November 2, 2020, the court granted\nin part and denied in part the defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss the consolidated complaint,\ndismissing state law claims, but denying\ndismissal of the U.S. antitrust claims. On\nSeptember 21, 2023, the court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. On\nFebruary 5, 2024, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit granted leave\nto appeal that decision. European Matters Tax\nIn matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case\nnumber 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority\n(\u201cDutch Authority\u201d) challenged in the Dutch\ncourts the prior set-off by the Firm of\napproximately \u20ac 124million (approximately $\n128million) plus accrued interest of\nwithholding tax credits against the Firm\u2019s\ncorporation tax liabilities for the tax years\n2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority alleged that\nthe Firm was not entitled to receive the\nwithholding tax credits on the basis, inter\nalia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold\nlegal title to certain securities subject to\nwithholding tax on the relevant dates. On\nApril 26, 2018, the District Court in\nAmsterdam issued a decision dismissing the\nDutch Authority\u2019s claims with respect to\ncertain of the tax years in dispute. On May\n12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam\ngranted the Dutch Authority\u2019s appeal in\nmatters re-styled Case number 18/00318 and\nCase number 18/00319 . On January 19, 2024,\nthe Dutch High Court granted the Firm\u2019s appeal\nin matters re-styled Case number 20/01884 and\nreferred the case to the Court of Appeal in\nThe Hague. On November 11, 2024, the Firm\nreached an agreement to settle the Dutch\nAuthority\u2019s challenges for the tax years 2007\nto 2012 and made payment of the prior set-off\namounts and interest indicated above. The case\nhas been withdrawn. On June 22, 2021, Dutch\ncriminal authorities sought various documents\nin connection with an investigation of the\nFirm related to the civil claims asserted by\nthe Dutch Authority concerning the accuracy of\nthe Firm subsidiary\u2019s tax returns for 2007 to\n2012. The Dutch criminal authorities have\nrequested additional information, and the Firm\nis continuing to respond to them in connection\nwith their ongoing investigation, and is\nengaging with them as the criminal process\nprogresses. U.K. Government Bond Matter On\nFebruary 21, 2025, the U.K. Competition and\nMarkets Authority announced a settlement with\nthe Firm, as well as other financial\ninstitutions, in connection with its\ninvestigation of suspected anti-competitive\narrangements in the financial services sector,\nspecifically regarding the Firm\u2019s activities\nconcerning certain liquid fixed income\nproducts between 2009 and 2012. Separately, on\nJune 16, 2023, the Firm was named as a\ndefendant in a purported antitrust class\naction in the United States District Court for\nthe SDNY styled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension\nand Retirement System v. Deutsche Bank\nAktiengesellschaft, et al. , alleging, inter\nalia, that the Firm, together with a number of\nother financial institution defendants,\nviolated U.S. antitrust laws in\n                                  \n  125    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nconnection with their alleged effort to fix\nprices of gilts traded in the United States\nbetween 2009 and 2013. The complaint seeks,\ninter alia, certification of the class of\nplaintiffs and treble damages. On September\n16, 2024, the court granted defendants\u2019 joint\nmotion to dismiss, and the complaint was\ndismissed without prejudice. The Firm and\ncertain other defendants have reached an\nagreement in principle to settle the U.S.\nlitigation. Other On August 13, 2021, the\nplaintiff in Camelot Event Driven Fund, a\nSeries of Frank Funds Trust v. Morgan Stanley\n& Co. LLC, et al. filed in the Supreme Court\nof the State of New York, New York County\n(\u201cSupreme Court of NY\u201d) a purported class\naction complaint alleging violations of\nfederal securities laws against ViacomCBS\n(\u201cViacom\u201d), certain of its officers and\ndirectors, and the underwriters, including the\nFirm, of two March 2021 Viacom offerings: a $\n1.7billion Viacom Class B Common Stock\noffering and a $ 1billion offering of 5.75%\nSeries A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\n(collectively, the \u201cOfferings\u201d). The complaint\nseeks certification of the class of plaintiffs\nand unspecified compensatory damages and\nalleges, inter alia, that the Viacom offering\ndocuments for both issuances contained\nmaterial misrepresentations and omissions\nbecause they did not disclose that certain of\nthe underwriters, including the Firm, had\nprime brokerage relationships and/or served as\ncounterparties to certain derivative\ntransactions with Archegos Capital Management\nLP (\u201cArchegos\u201d), a fund with significant\nexposure to Viacom securities across multiple\nprime brokers. The complaint also alleges that\nthe offering documents did not adequately\ndisclose the risks associated with Archegos\u2019s\nconcentrated Viacom positions at the various\nprime brokers, including that the unwind of\nthose positions could have a deleterious\nimpact on the stock price of Viacom. On\nNovember 5, 2021, the complaint was amended to\nadd allegations that defendants failed to\ndisclose that certain underwriters, including\nthe Firm, had intended to unwind Archegos\u2019s\nViacom positions while simultaneously\ndistributing the Offerings. On February 6,\n2023, the court issued a decision denying\nmotions to dismiss as to the Firm and the\nother underwriters, but granting the motion to\ndismiss as to Viacom and the Viacom individual\ndefendants. On February 15, 2023, the\nunderwriters, including the Firm, filed their\nnotices of appeal of the denial of their\nmotions to dismiss. On March 10, 2023, the\nplaintiff appealed the dismissal of Viacom and\nthe individual Viacom defendants. On April 4,\n2024, the Appellate Division upheld the lower\ncourt\u2019s decision as to the Firm and other\nunderwriter defendants that had prime\nbrokerage relationships and/or served as\ncounterparties to certain derivative\ntransactions with Archegos, dismissed the\nremaining underwriters, and upheld the\ndismissal of Viacom and its officers and\ndirectors. On July 25, 2024, the Appellate\nDivision denied the plaintiff\u2019s and the Firm\u2019s\nrespective motions for leave to reargue or\nappeal the April 4, 2024 decision. On January\n4, 2024, the court granted the plaintiff\u2019s\nmotion for class certification, which the\ndefendants have appealed. On May 17, 2013, the\nplaintiff in IKB International S.A. in\nLiquidation, et al. v. Morgan Stanley, et al.\nfiled a complaint against the Firm and certain\naffiliates in the Supreme Court of NY. The\ncomplaint alleges that defendants made\nmaterial misrepresentations and omissions in\nthe sale to the plaintiff of certain mortgage\npass-through certificates backed by\nsecuritization trusts containing residential\nmortgage loans. The total amount of\ncertificates allegedly sponsored, underwritten\nand/or sold by the Firm to the plaintiff was\napproximately $ 133million. The complaint\nalleges causes of action against the Firm for\ncommon law fraud, fraudulent concealment,\naiding and abetting fraud, and negligent\nmisrepresentation, and seeks, inter alia,\ncompensatory and punitive damages. On October\n29, 2014, the court granted in part and denied\nin part the Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss. All\nclaims regarding fourcertificates were\ndismissed. After these dismissals, the\nremaining amount of certificates allegedly\nissued by the Firm or sold to the plaintiff by\nthe Firm was approximately $ 116million. On\nAugust 11, 2016, the Appellate Division\naffirmed the trial court\u2019s order denying in\npart the Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. On July 15, 2022, the Firm filed a\nmotion for summary judgment on all remaining\nclaims. On March 1, 2023, the court granted in\npart and denied in part the Firm\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment, narrowing the alleged\nmisrepresentations at issue in the case. On\nMarch 26, 2024, the Appellate Division\naffirmed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment\norder. On August 27, 2024, the plaintiff\nnotified the court that in light of the\ncourt\u2019s rulings to exclude certain evidence at\ntrial, the plaintiff could not prove its\nclaims at trial, and requested that the court\ndismiss the case, subject to its right to\nappeal the evidentiary rulings. On August 28,\n2024, the court dismissed the case, and\njudgment was entered in the Firm\u2019s favor. The\nplaintiff has filed notices of appeal.\nBeginning in February of 2024, Morgan Stanley\nSmith Barney LLC (\u201cMSSB\u201d) and E*TRADE\nSecurities LLC (\u201cE*TRADE Securities\u201d), among\nothers, have been named as defendants in\nmultiple putative class actions pending in the\nfederal district courts for the District of\nNew Jersey and SDNY. The class action claims\nhave been brought on behalf of brokerage,\nadvisory and retirement account holders,\nalleging various contractual, fiduciary, and\nstatutory claims (including under the\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nAct, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71962(c)-(d)) that MSSB and/or\nE*TRADE Securities failed to pay a reasonable\nrate of interest on its cash sweep products.\nThe cases are at an early stage with motions\nfor consolidation and transfer currently\npending. Together, the complaints seek, inter\nalia, certification of a class of plaintiffs,\nunspecified compensatory damages, equitable\nand injunctive relief, and treble damages. The\nFirm has been engaged with and is responding\nto requests for information from the\nEnforcement Division of the SEC regarding\nadvisory account cash balances swept to the\n                                  \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    126  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \naffiliate bank deposit\nprogram and compliance\nwith the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940,\nand from a state\nsecurities regulator\nregarding brokerage\naccount cash balances\nswept to the affiliate\nbank deposit program.\n15. Variable Interest\nEntities and\nSecuritization\nActivities Overview\nThe Firm is involved\nwith various SPEs in\nthe normal course of\nbusiness. In most\ncases, these entities\nare deemed to be VIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable\ninterests in VIEs\ninclude debt and\nequity interests,\ncommitments,\nguarantees, derivative\ninstruments and\ncertain fees. The\nFirm\u2019s involvement\nwith VIEs arises\nprimarily from: \u2022\nInterests purchased in\nconnection with\nmarket-making\nactivities, securities\nheld in its Investment\nsecurities portfolio\nand retained interests\nheld as a result of\nsecuritization\nactivities, including\nre-securitization\ntransactions. \u2022\nGuarantees issued and\nresidual interests\nretained in connection\nwith municipal bond\nsecuritizations. \u2022\nLoans made to and\ninvestments in VIEs\nthat hold debt,\nequity, real estate or\nother assets. \u2022\nDerivatives entered\ninto with VIEs. \u2022\nStructuring of CLNs or\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes\ndesigned to meet the\ninvestment objectives\nof clients. \u2022 Other\nstructured\ntransactions designed\nto provide tax-\nefficient yields to\nthe Firm or its\nclients. The Firm\ndetermines whether it\nis the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE\nupon its initial\ninvolvement with the\nVIE and reassesses\nwhether it is the\nprimary beneficiary on\nan ongoing basis as\nlong as it has any\ncontinuing involvement\nwith the VIE. This\ndetermination is based\nupon an analysis of\nthe design of the VIE,\nincluding the VIE\u2019s\nstructure and\nactivities, the power\nto make significant\neconomic decisions\nheld by the Firm and\nby other parties, and\nthe variable interests\nowned by the Firm and\nother parties. The\npower to make the most\nsignificant economic\ndecisions may take a\nnumber of different\nforms in different\ntypes of VIEs. The\nFirm considers\nservicing or\ncollateral management\ndecisions as\nrepresenting the power\nto make the most\nsignificant economic\ndecisions in\ntransactions such as\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs. As a result, the\nFirm does not\nconsolidate\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs for which it does\nnot act as the\nservicer or collateral\nmanager unless it\nholds certain other\nrights to replace the\nservicer or collateral\nmanager or to require\nthe liquidation of the\nentity. If the Firm\nserves as servicer or\ncollateral manager, or\nhas certain other\nrights described in\nthe previous sentence,\nthe Firm analyzes the\ninterests in the VIE\nthat it holds and\nconsolidates only\nthose VIEs for which\nit holds a potentially\nsignificant interest\nin the VIE.\n\nFor many transactions,\nsuch as re-\nsecuritization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes,\nthere are no\nsignificant economic\ndecisions made on an\nongoing basis. In\nthese cases, the Firm\nfocuses its analysis\non decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing of the\ntransaction and at the\ntermination of the\ntransaction. The Firm\nconcluded in most of\nthese transactions\nthat decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing were shared\nbetween the Firm and\nthe initial investors\nbased upon the nature\nof the assets,\nincluding whether the\nassets were issued in\na transaction\nsponsored by the Firm\nand the extent of the\ninformation available\nto the Firm and to\ninvestors, the number,\nnature and involvement\nof investors, other\nrights held by the\nFirm and investors,\nthe standardization of\nthe legal\ndocumentation and the\nlevel of continuing\ninvolvement by the\nFirm, including the\namount and type of\ninterests owned by the\nFirm and by other\ninvestors. The Firm\nfocused its control\ndecision on any right\nheld by the Firm or\ninvestors related to\nthe termination of the\nVIE. Most re-\nsecuritization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes have\nno such termination\nrights.\nConsolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by\nType of Activity\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        VIE       VIE       VIE       VIE  \n  in       As\u2026       Li\u2026       As\u2026       Li\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  575    $  236    $  597    $  256  \n  I\u2026       378       189       753       502  \n  v\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026       619       578       582       520  \n  O\u2026       156         4       378        97  \n  T\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n                                              \nMTOB\u2014Municipal tender option bonds\n1.

In\nmany securitization\ntransactions involving\ncommercial mortgage\nloans, the Firm\ntransfers a portion of\nthe assets to the SPE\nwith unrelated parties\ntransferring the\nremaining assets. In\naddition, mainly in\nsecuritization\ntransactions involving\nresidential mortgage\nloans, the Firm may\nalso enter into\nderivative\ntransactions,\nprimarily interest\nrate swaps or interest\nrate caps, with the\nSPE. Although not\nobligated, the Firm\ngenerally makes a\nmarket in the\nsecurities issued by\nSPEs in securitization\ntransactions. As a\nmarket maker, the Firm\noffers to buy these\nsecurities from, and\nsell these securities\nto, investors.\nSecurities purchased\nthrough these market-\nmaking activities are\nnot considered to be\nretained interests;\nthese beneficial\ninterests generally\nare included in\nTrading\nassets\u2014Corporate and\nother debt and are\nmeasured at fair\nvalue. The Firm enters\ninto derivatives,\ngenerally interest\nrate swaps and\ninterest rate caps,\nwith a senior payment\npriority in many\nsecuritization\ntransactions.

See Note 6 for further information\non derivative instruments and hedging\nactivities. Investment Securities The Firm\nholds securities issued by VIEs within the\nInvestment securities portfolio. These\nsecurities are composed of those related to\ntransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies and predominantly the most senior\nsecurities issued by VIEs backed by student\nloans and commercial mortgage loans.\nTransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies include an explicit or implicit\nguarantee provided by the U.S. government.\nAdditionally, the Firm holds certain\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities issued\nby VIEs retained as a result of the Firm\u2019s\nsecuritization activities. See Note 7 for\nfurther information on the Investment\nsecurities portfolio. Municipal Tender Option\nBond Trusts In a municipal tender option bond\ntrust transaction, the client transfers a\nmunicipal bond to a trust. The trust issues\nshort-term securities that the Firm, as the\nremarketing agent, sells to investors. The\nclient generally retains a residual interest.\nThe short-term securities are supported by a\nliquidity facility pursuant to which the\ninvestors may put their short-term interests.\nIn most programs, a third-party provider will\nprovide such liquidity facility; in some\nprograms, the Firm provides this liquidity\nfacility. The Firm may, in lieu of purchasing\nshort-term securities for remarketing, decide\nto extend a temporary loan to the trust. The\nclient can generally terminate the transaction\nat any time. The liquidity provider can\ngenerally terminate the transaction upon the\noccurrence of certain events. When the\ntransaction is terminated, the municipal bond\nis generally sold or returned to the client.\nAny losses suffered by the liquidity provider\nupon the sale of the bond are the\nresponsibility of the client. This obligation\nis generally collateralized. Liquidity\nfacilities provided to municipal tender option\nbond trusts are classified as derivatives. The\nFirm consolidates any municipal tender option\nbond trusts in which it holds the residual\ninterest. Credit Protection Purchased through\nCredit-Linked Notes CLN transactions are\ndesigned to provide investors with exposure to\ncertain credit risk on referenced assets. In\nthese transactions, the Firm transfers assets\n(generally high-quality securities or money-\nmarket investments) to an SPE, enters into a\nderivative transaction in which the SPE sells\nprotection on an unrelated referenced asset or\ngroup of assets, through a credit derivative,\nand sells the securities issued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may\nalso enter into interest rate or currency\nswaps with the SPE. Depending on the\nstructure, the assets and liabilities of the\nSPE may be consolidated and recognized in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or accounted for as a\nsale of assets. Upon the occurrence of a\ncredit event related to the referenced asset,\nthe SPE will deliver securities collateral as\npayment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to\nchanges in the collateral\u2019s value. Derivative\npayments by the SPE are collateralized. The\nrisks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas those with non-SPE counterparties and are\nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall\nexposure. Other Structured Financings The Firm\ninvests in tax equity investment interests\nissued by entities that develop and own low-\nincome communities (including low-income\nhousing projects) and entities that construct\nand own facilities that will generate energy\nfrom renewable resources. The interests\nentitle the Firm to a share of tax credits and\ntax losses generated by these projects. In\naddition, the Firm has issued guarantees to\ninvestors in certain low-income housing funds.\nThe guarantees are designed to return an\ninvestor\u2019s contribution to a fund and the\ninvestor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax credits\nexpected to be generated by the fund. The Firm\nis also involved with entities designed to\nprovide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or\nits clients. Collateralized Loan and Debt\nObligations CLOs and CDOs are SPEs that\npurchase a pool of assets consisting of\ncorporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or\nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through\nderivatives and issue multiple tranches of\ndebt and equity securities to investors. The\nFirm underwrites the securities issued in\ncertain CLO transactions on behalf of\nunaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory\nservices to these unaffiliated sponsors. The\nFirm sells corporate loans to many of these\nSPEs, in some cases representing a significant\nportion of the total assets purchased.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally\nmakes a market in the securities issued by\nSPEs in these transactions and may retain\nunsold securities. These beneficial interests\nare included in Trading assets and are\nmeasured at fair value. Equity-Linked Notes\nELN transactions are designed to provide\ninvestors with exposure to certain risks\nrelated to the specific equity security,\nequity index or other index. In an ELN\ntransaction, the Firm typically transfers to\nan SPE either a note issued by the Firm, the\npayments on which are linked to the\nperformance of a specific equity security,\nequity index or other index, or debt\nsecurities issued by other companies and a\nderivative contract, the terms of which will\nrelate to the performance of a specific equity\nsecurity, equity index or other index. These\nELN transactions with SPEs were not\nconsolidated at December 31, 2024 or December\n31, 2023.\n                                  \n  129    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n

Regulatory Requirements Regulatory Capital\nFramework The Firm is an FHC under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and\nis subject to the regulation and oversight of\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal\nReserve establishes capital requirements for\nthe Firm, including \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards, and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance\nwith such capital requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries, including, among others, MSBNA\nand MSPBNA (together, \u201cU.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries\u201d). The regulatory capital\nrequirements are largely based on the Basel\nIII capital standards established by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision and also\nimplement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct. In addition, many of the Firm\u2019s regulated\nsubsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital\nrequirements, including regulated subsidiaries\nregistered as swap dealers with the CFTC or\nconditionally registered as security-based\nswap dealers with the SEC or registered as\nbroker-dealers or futures commission\nmerchants. Regulatory Capital Requirements The\nFirm is required to maintain minimum risk-\nbased and leverage-based capital ratios under\nregulatory capital requirements. A summary of\nthe calculations of regulatory capital and RWA\nfollows. Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Risk-\nbased capital ratio requirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital (which includes Tier\n2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and\nconsist of regulatory minimum required ratios\nplus the Firm\u2019s capital buffer requirement.\nCapital requirements require certain\nadjustments to, and deductions from, capital\nfor purposes of determining these ratios. CECL\nDeferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the\nFirm elected to defer the effect of the\nadoption of CECL on its risk-based and\nleverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as\nwell as RWA, adjusted average assets and\nsupplementary leverage exposure calculations,\nover a five-year transition period. The\ndeferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per\nyear from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in\nat 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral\nimpacts were fully phased-in from January 1,\n2025.\nCapital Buffer Requirements\n                                              \n                                     At       \n                                     Decemb\u2026  \n             At          At          31,      \n             December    December    2024an\u2026  \n             31,         31,         31,      \n             2024        2023        2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             Standar\u2026    Standar\u2026    Advanc\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  buffers                                     \n  Capital                                     \n  conser\u2026    \u2014           \u2014           2.5%     \n  buffer                                      \n  SCB        6.0%        5.4%        N/A      \n  G-SIB                                       \n  capital    3.0%        3.0%        3.0%     \n  surcha\u2026                                     \n  CCyB1      0%          0%          0%       \n  Capital                                     \n  buffer     9.0%        8.4%        5.5%     \n  requir\u2026                                     \n                                              \n1.

The U.S.\nQualified Plan assets\nrepresent 86% and 87%\nof the Firm\u2019s total\npension plan assets at\nDecember 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The U.S.\nQualified Plan uses a\ncombination of active\nand risk-controlled\nfixed income\ninvestment strategies.\nThe fixed income asset\nallocation consists\nprimarily of fixed\nincome securities and\nrelated derivative\ninstruments designed\nto approximate the\nexpected cash flows of\nthe plan\u2019s liabilities\nto help reduce plan\nexposure to interest\nrate variation and to\nbetter align assets\nwith the obligation.\nThe longer-duration\nfixed income\nallocation is expected\nto help protect the\nplan\u2019s funded status\nand maintain the\nstability of plan\ncontributions over the\nlong run. The\ninvestment portfolio\nperformance is\nassessed by comparing\nactual investment\nperformance with\nchanges in the\nestimated present\nvalue of the U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nbenefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments\nare permitted in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio\nonly to the extent\nthat they comply with\nall of the plan\u2019s\ninvestment policy\nguidelines and are\nconsistent with the\nplan\u2019s risk and return\nobjectives. As a\nfundamental operating\nprinciple, any\nrestrictions on the\nunderlying assets\napply to the\nrespective derivative\nproduct. This includes\npercentage allocations\nand credit quality.\nDerivatives are used\nsolely for the purpose\nof enhancing\n\ninvestment returns in\nthe underlying assets\nand not to circumvent\nportfolio\nrestrictions. Plan\nassets are measured at\nfair value using\nvaluation techniques\nthat are consistent\nwith the valuation\ntechniques applied to\nthe Firm\u2019s major\ncategories of assets\nand liabilities as\ndescribed in Notes 2\nand 4. OTC derivative\ncontracts consist of\ninvestments in\ninterest rate swaps\nand total return\nswaps. Other\ninvestments consist of\ninsurance contracts\nheld by non-U.S.-based\nplans. The insurance\ncontracts are valued\nbased on the premium\nreserve of the insurer\nfor a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given\nto the employee\nbenefit plan that\napproximates fair\nvalue. The insurance\ncontracts are\ncategorized in Level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nprivately offered\nfunds regulated,\nsupervised and subject\nto periodic\nexamination by a U.S.\nfederal or state\nagency and available\nto institutional\nclients. The trust\nmust be maintained for\nthe collective\ninvestment or\nreinvestment of assets\ncontributed to it from\nU.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans\nmaintained by more\nthan one employer or\ncontrolled group of\ncorporations. The\nsponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds\nvalues the funds based\non the fair value of\nthe underlying\nsecurities. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nredeemable at NAV at\nthe measurement date\nor in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based\nplans hold foreign\nfunds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed\nincome funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed\nincome funds and\ntargeted cash flow\nfunds are designed to\nprovide a series of\nfixed annual cash\nflows achieved by\nprimarily investing in\ngovernment bonds.\nLiquidity funds place\na high priority on\ncapital preservation,\nstable value and a\nhigh liquidity of\nassets. Foreign funds\nare readily redeemable\nat NAV.

Regarding\nthe Effectiveness of\nDisclosure Controls\nand Procedures\n\nUnder the supervision\nand with the\nparticipation of the\nFirm\u2019s management,\nincluding the Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nChief Financial\nOfficer, the Firm\nconducted an\nevaluation of the\neffectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and\nprocedures (as defined\nin Rule 13a-15(e) of\nthe Securities\nExchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the\n\u201cExchange Act\u201d)).\nBased on this\nevaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and\nChief Financial\nOfficer concluded that\nthe Firm\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and\nprocedures were\neffective as of the\nend of the period\ncovered by this annual\nreport.\n\nManagement\u2019s Report on\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nThe Firm\u2019s management\nis responsible for\nestablishing and\nmaintaining adequate\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nThe Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting is designed\nto provide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nthe reliability of\nfinancial reporting\nand the preparation of\nfinancial statements\nfor external purposes\nin accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\nin the United States\nof America (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d).\n\nThe internal control\nover financial\nreporting includes\nthose policies and\nprocedures that:\n\n\u2022 Pertain to the\nmaintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the\nassets of the Firm;\n\n\u2022 Provide reasonable\nassurance that\ntransactions are\nrecorded as necessary\nto permit preparation\nof financial\nstatements in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP and that receipts\nand expenditures are\nbeing made only in\naccordance with\nauthorizations of the\nFirm\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and\n\n\u2022 Provide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nprevention or timely\ndetection of\nunauthorized\nacquisition, use or\ndisposition of Firm\nassets that could have\na material effect on\nthe Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its\ninherent limitations,\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nmay not prevent or\ndetect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of\nany evaluation of\neffectiveness to\nfuture periods are\nsubject to the risk\nthat controls may\nbecome inadequate\nbecause of changes in\nconditions or that the\ndegree of compliance\nwith the policies or\nprocedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed\nthe effectiveness of\nthe Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024. In\nmaking this\nassessment, management\nused the criteria set\nforth by the Committee\nof Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated\nFramework (2013).\nBased on management\u2019s\nassessment and those\ncriteria, management\nbelieves that the Firm\nmaintained effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as\nof December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s independent\nregistered public\naccounting firm has\naudited and issued a\nreport on the Firm\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\nwhich appears below.\n                                  \n  December 2024 Form 10-K    152  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n   Report of Independent Registered Public    \n               Accounting Firm                \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Morgan Stanley:\n                                              \n   Opinion on Internal Control over           \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nWe have audited the\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting of\nMorgan Stanley and\nsubsidiaries (the\n\u201cFirm\u201d) as of December\n31, 2024, based on\ncriteria established\nin Internal Control \u2014\nIntegrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the\nCommittee of\nSponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(COSO). In our\nopinion, the Firm\nmaintained, in all\nmaterial respects,\neffective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024,\nbased on criteria\nestablished in\nInternal Control \u2014\nIntegrated Framework\n(2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited,\nin accordance with the\nstandards of the\nPublic Company\nAccounting Oversight\nBoard (United States)\n(PCAOB), the financial\nstatements of the Firm\nas of and for the year\nended December 31,\n2024 and our report\ndated February 21,\n2025 expressed an\nunqualified opinion on\nthose financial\nstatements.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinion                           \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s management\nis responsible for\nmaintaining effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nand for its assessment\nof the effectiveness\nof internal control\nover financial\nreporting, included in\nthe accompanying\nManagement\u2019s Report on\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is\nto express an opinion\non the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting based on our\naudit. We are a public\naccounting firm\nregistered with the\nPCAOB and are required\nto be independent with\nrespect to the Firm in\naccordance with the\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws and\nthe applicable rules\nand regulations of the\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit\nin accordance with the\nstandards of the\nPCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan\nand perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable\nassurance about\nwhether effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nwas maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our\naudit included\nobtaining an\nunderstanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\n\nassessing the risk\nthat a material\nweakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating\nthe design and\noperating\neffectiveness of\ninternal control based\non the assessed risk,\nand performing such\nother procedures as we\nconsidered necessary\nin the circumstances.\nWe believe that our\naudit provides a\nreasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\nDefinition and\nLimitations of\nInternal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting is a process\ndesigned to provide\nreasonable assurance\nregarding the\nreliability of\nfinancial reporting\nand the preparation of\nfinancial statements\nfor external purposes\nin accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles.\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes\nthose policies and\nprocedures that (1)\npertain to the\nmaintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the\nassets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable\nassurance that\ntransactions are\nrecorded as necessary\nto permit preparation\nof financial\nstatements in\naccordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles,\nand that receipts and\nexpenditures of the\ncompany are being made\nonly in accordance\nwith authorizations of\nmanagement and\ndirectors of the\ncompany; and (3)\nprovide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nprevention or timely\ndetection of\nunauthorized\nacquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material\neffect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its\ninherent limitations,\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nmay not prevent or\ndetect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of\nany evaluation of\neffectiveness to\nfuture periods are\nsubject to the risk\nthat controls may\nbecome inadequate\nbecause of changes in\nconditions, or that\nthe degree of\ncompliance with the\npolicies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nLLP\nNew York, New York\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n                                  \n  153    December 2024 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nChanges in Internal\nControl Over Financial\nReporting No change in\nthe Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting (as such\nterm is defined in\nExchange Act Rule\n13a-15(f)) occurred\nduring the quarter\nended December 31,\n2024 that materially\naffected, or is\nreasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting.
