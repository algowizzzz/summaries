I hope that you will be able to  \n  attend, and, if not, I encourage you to     \n  vote by proxy. Your vote is very            \n  important.                                  \n  2020 was an extraordinary and unusual       \n  year. We remain in the midst of a global    \n  public health crisis                        \n  that has caused serious humanitarian and    \n  economic issues, leaving an indelible mark  \n  on many of us. We all know family and       \n  friends that were directly affected or      \n  lost, or who endured the economic           \n  consequences of the shutdown of large       \n  swaths of the global economy. Our hearts    \n  go out to all of those directly and         \n  indirectly impacted by this crisis.         \n  Unlike over a decade ago, this time banks   \n  had the capital and liquidity to help       \n  their clients and                           \n  through that the real economy. As the       \n  public health crisis grew and market        \n  volatility spiked, Morgan Stanley, along    \n  with the other eight largest banks in the   \n  U.S., voluntarily suspended its share       \n  buybacks in March of 2020 to ensure that    \n  we maintained that capital and liquidity.   \n  We helped our corporate and institutional   \n  clients raise additional liquidity and      \n  obtain the financing they needed, and       \n  guided our retail clients to manage their   \n  investment portfolios. Furthermore,         \n  we worked with the Federal Reserve, U.S.    \n  Treasury and other global governmental      \n  agencies to facilitate the numerous         \n  programs aimed at keeping markets           \n  functioning and supporting those affected   \n  by the economic downturn.                   \n  Throughout the year, we also supported the  \n  more vulnerable in our communities through  \n  charitable                                  \n  donations and employee engagement, and I    \n  believe we made a difference. We partnered  \n  with employees to contribute to local food  \n  banks and worked with organizations that    \n  were fighting rising rates of hunger and    \n  caring for the sick and                     \n  vulnerable in our communities. We           \n  contributed to programs and organizations   \n  that did not receive federal assistance to  \n  ensure an equitable recovery. We are        \n  supporting organizations working to         \n  correct the social and economic imbalances  \n  in                                          \n  society that became more pronounced during  \n  the COVID-19 pandemic.                      \n  Our services to our clients and support to  \n  our communities would not have been         \n  possible without the                        \n  hard work and dedication of all our         \n  employees. Due to robust business           \n  continuity planning and years of            \n  investment in our technology                \n  infrastructure, the vast majority of our    \n  employees have been able to work from home  \n  and continue to serve                       \n  clients. I am proud of the commitment they  \n  have shown to our clients and to Morgan     \n  Stanley in these extraordinary              \n  circumstances.                              \n  2020 was also a year in which a number of   \n  well-publicized events led to a heightened  \n  and necessary                               \n  focus on racial and social justice, and a   \n  recognition that explicit support and       \n  purposeful collective action will be        \n  required to make sustained structural       \n  changes to ensure a more just and           \n  equitable society. We are seeking to be     \n  part of                                     \n  the solution \u2013 by being a better Firm and   \n  contributing to a better society. In June,  \n  we added a new fifth value to our core      \n  values: Commit to Diversity and Inclusion.  \n  Our core values - Do the Right              \n                                              \n                                        \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement1  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \n  Thing, Put Clients First, Lead with         \n  Exceptional Ideas and Give Back - have      \n  long underpinned                            \n  everything we do. While our shared          \n  commitment to diversity has always been     \n  understood to be a part of Do the Right     \n  Thing, we felt that it was imperative to    \n  more explicitly state our responsibility    \n  for representation, equitable treatment     \n  and justice. We are committed to a diverse  \n  and inclusive work environment where all    \n  employees can thrive. We published our      \n  first Diversity and Inclusion Report in     \n  2020, reflecting our commitment to          \n  increased transparency and being            \n  accountable for our progress. It discloses  \n  employee representation, and our efforts    \n  and initiatives in advancement and          \n  outreach.                                   \n  Against an extraordinary and challenging    \n  backdrop, and by focusing on our clients    \n  and employees,                              \n  Morgan Stanley delivered record results in  \n  2020. We generated strong returns for our   \n  shareholders, while meaningfully driving    \n  our strategic vision forward. For the full  \n  year, Morgan Stanley reported record        \n  revenues of $48.2 billion and               \n  record net income of $11.0 billion, and     \n  produced a return on average tangible       \n  common equity (ROTCE) of 15.2%. We          \n  delivered strong results across all our     \n  businesses while remaining disciplined in   \n  our risk management.                        \n  The execution of our decade-long strategy   \n  reached a milestone last year. In addition  \n  to strong                                   \n  financial performance, we successfully      \n  closed our acquisition of E*TRADE and       \n  announced our acquisition of Eaton Vance,   \n  which closed last month. We received an     \n  upgrade from Moody\u2019s, and subsequently      \n  were upgraded again in January of this      \n  year, and are now at A1. Following the      \n  Federal Reserve's release of its second     \n  stress test result, we announced a $10      \n  billion share buyback program that we are   \n  executing in 2021. Our performance and      \n  competitive position serve as concrete      \n  evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached    \n  an inflection point. We have meaningfully   \n  and with intent transformed our business    \n  over the last decade. As we look to the     \n  next decade of our journey, we believe      \n  unambiguously that Morgan Stanley           \n  is in its growth phase.                     \n  As we make the important pivot to a growth  \n  organization, we need to continue to        \n  enhance our culture                         \n  of accountability, collaboration and        \n  inclusion, build a broad and diverse        \n  organization, and develop the talent to     \n  steer the Firm for the next decade of       \n  success. Leading our efforts is a strong    \n  and experienced senior leadership team,     \n  with                                        \n  talented executives on both the business    \n  and infrastructure sides. The commitment    \n  to our culture of the entire Operating      \n  Committee are key to driving the Firm       \n  forward. I am confident of their skills     \n  and invested in their success. The          \n  Board of Directors and I will continue to   \n  evolve the organizational leadership to     \n  ensure we have the right management team    \n  to lead this Firm for the next decade.      \n  Our Board of Directors and management       \n  value the views of our shareholders and     \n  engage with them                            \n  year-round on a broad range of topics,      \n  including our strategy, financial           \n  performance, executive compensation,        \n  corporate governance, human capital         \n  management and environmental and social     \n  goals. At the annual meeting, Takeshi       \n  Ogasawara will                              \n  step down from our Board and we are         \n  nominating Hironori Kamezawa to replace     \n  him as an MUFG director. I would like to    \n  thank Mr. Ogasawara for his many services   \n  and I know we will benefit from Mr.         \n  Kamezawa\u2019s years of financial services      \n  experience. Hutham Olayan is also stepping  \n  down from the Board. Over the past 15       \n  years, she served on several committees,    \n  and most recently chaired the               \n  Compensation, Management Development and    \n  Succession committee. I would like to       \n  thank                                       \n  Ms. Olayan for her dedicated service to     \n  Morgan Stanley and many contributions to    \n  the Board.                                  \n  I hope you will read my Letter to           \n  Shareholders where I discuss our            \n  achievements and opportunities              \n  for the future in greater detail. I look    \n  forward to hearing from you at the Annual   \n  Meeting next month. Please continue to      \n  stay healthy.                               \n  Thank you for your support of Morgan        \n  Stanley.                                    \n  Very truly yours,                           \n  James P.

With respect to executive     \n  compensation, shareholders who provided     \n  feedback during our engagement program      \n  generally praised the quality of the        \n  Company\u2019s disclosure and reported that      \n  the Committee\u2019s use of discretion in the    \n  administration of the program is            \n  reasonable and that executive compensation  \n  at Morgan Stanley is viewed as              \n  well-aligned with performance.              \n                                              \n                                         \n  10Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  OVERVIEW OF VOTING ITEMS  \n                            \nItem 4                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n    Company Proposal to Approve the           \n    Amended and Restated Equity Incentive     \n    Compensation Plan                         \n    (EICP)                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n          Our Board unanimously recommends    \n          that you vote\u201cFOR\u201dthis proposal.    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u200b                                            \n  (1)Overhang represents the number of        \n  shares underlying outstanding employee      \n  equity awards and available for future      \n  employee equity                             \n  awards as a percentage of weighted          \n  average common shares outstanding for       \n  the period.                                 \n  (2)Burn rate represents the number of       \n  employee shares granted per year            \n  pursuant to equity awards as percent        \n  of weighted average common                  \n  shares outstanding for the period.          \n                                              \n                                              \n          See page86for the proposal to       \n          approve the Amended and Restated    \n          Equity                              \n          Incentive Compensation Plan.        \n                                              \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement11  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS Item 1           \n                             \n    Election of Directors    \n                             \n                                              \n          Our Board unanimously recommends    \n          that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the election    \n          of all director                     \n          nominees.                           \n                                              \nDIRECTOR SUCCESSION AND NOMINATION PROCESS    \n                                      \n  Key Statistics on Board Succession  \n                                      \n                                              \n    5.4 years      64.4                  5    \n                   years                      \n                                       new    \n    Average        Average        directo\u2026    \n    tenure of      age of           in the    \n    Board          Board              last    \n    upon           upon              three    \n    election       election          years    \n    at annual      at annual        (since    \n    meeting        meeting             the    \n                                  beginni\u2026    \n                                  of 2018)    \n                                              \nThe Nominating and Governance Committee\u2019s     \ncharter provides that the committee will      \nactively seek and identify nominees for       \nrecommendation to the Board consistent with   \nthe criteria in the Morgan Stanley Corporate  \nGovernance Policies (Corporate Governance     \nPolicies), which provide that the Board values\nmembers who:                                  \n                                              \n     Combine a broad spectrum of experience   \n  \u2022  and expertise with a reputation for      \n     integrity;

The\nNominating and Governance Committee oversees  \nan orientation program for new directors,     \nwhich includes an overview of director duties,\nour Corporate Governance Policies, Code of    \nEthics and Business Conduct and other         \napplicable policies. New directors also       \nreceive presentations by senior management,   \nincluding the CFO, CLO and CRO, on the        \nCompany\u2019s strategy and regulatory framework,  \nits primary business lines and control        \nframework, and a one-on-one session with the  \nChairman and CEO. As directors are appointed  \nto new committees or assume a leadership role,\nsuch as committee chair, they receive         \nadditional orientation sessions specific to   \nsuch responsibilities. We also conduct ongoing\neducational briefings on ESG, governance,     \nregulatory and control matters, as well as    \n\u201cdeep dive\u201d presentations on certain          \nbusinesses, emerging risks and focus areas    \nidentified by the Board, including climate    \nrisk. In addition, we reimburse directors for \nreasonable costs incurred attending           \neducational sessions on subjects that would   \nassist them in discharging their duties.      \nSenior Management Succession and Development  \nPlanning The CMDS Committee oversees CEO and  \nsenior management succession and development  \nplanning, which covers unexpected as well as  \nplanned events and is formally reviewed, in   \nconjunction with the entire Board, at least   \nannually. Our CEO and our Chief Human         \nResources Officer review recommendations and  \nevaluations of potential internal CEO and     \nsenior management successors, and review their\nqualifications, skills, accomplishments and   \ndevelopmental areas. Potential internal CEO   \nand senior management successors regularly    \nattend Board meetings and engage with Board   \nmembers periodically between Board meetings,  \nincluding during preparatory meetings, client-\nrelated events and visits to our offices      \naround the world. These interactions provide  \nthe Board with the opportunities to become    \nfamiliar with the Company\u2019s executive talent  \nin different settings, which is critical to   \nthe Company\u2019s succession planning. Annual     \nEvaluation of Board, Committees and           \nIndependent Lead Director Overview of         \nEvaluation Process The Board believes that    \nestablishing and maintaining a constructive   \nevaluation process is essential to maintaining\nBoard effectiveness and best corporate        \ngovernance practices.

Under the \npolicy, the Nominating and Governance         \nCommittee evaluates director candidates       \nrecommended by shareholders in the same manner\nas other director candidates. In order for    \ndirector candidate recommendations to be      \nconsidered for the 2022 annual meeting of     \nshareholders, recommendations must be         \nsubmitted in accordance with the policy by    \nDecember 2, 2021. Shareholder Engagement Our  \nBoard and management value the views of our   \nshareholders and engage with them year-round  \non a broad range of topics, including our     \nstrategy, financial performance, executive    \ncompensation, corporate governance, human     \ncapital management, including diversity and   \ninclusion, and environmental and social goals.\nOur Board receives reporting on feedback from \ninvestors and shareholder voting results. In  \naddition, management routinely engages with   \ninvestors at conferences and other forums. We \nalso speak with proxy advisors to discuss, and\nreceive feedback on, our governance practices \nand executive compensation programs. Feedback \nfrom investors informs the Board\u2019s ongoing    \nreview of governance and compensation matters.\nThe Board has taken action responsive to such \nshareholder feedback, including the adoption  \nof amendments to our bylaws to implement proxy\naccess. In recent years, we have also enhanced\nour proxy disclosure of Board evaluations,    \ndirector orientation and education, director  \ndiversity and skills, Board succession        \nplanning, ESG matters and alignment of        \ncompensation and performance. After discussion\nwith shareholders, in 2020 we published our   \ninaugural Diversity and Inclusion report.

Director Independence The Board has  \nadopted Director Independence Standards, which\nare more stringent than the independence      \nrequirements outlined in the NYSE rules in    \ncertain respects, and delineate relationships \nthat are deemed to impair independence and    \ncategories of relationships that are not      \ndeemed material for purposes of director      \nindependence (Director Independence           \nStandards). The Director Independence         \nStandards, which are part of our Corporate    \nGovernance Policies available at              \nwww.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance,    \nprovide that, for a director to be considered \nindependent, a director must meet the         \nfollowing categorical standards: 1.

Board Meetings and Committees   \nBoard Meetings Our Board met 23 times during  \n2020, a 50% increase from the prior year due  \nto the Board\u2019s heightened focus on the        \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the E*TRADE acquisition and\nthe Company\u2019s agreement to acquire Eaton      \nVance. Each current director attended at least\n75% of the total number of meetings of the    \nBoard and committees on which such director   \nserved that were held during 2020 while the   \ndirector was a member. In addition to Board   \nand committee meetings, our directors also    \nengaged in less formal communications between \nmeetings, including discussions, briefings and\neducational sessions, with the Independent    \nLead Director, Chairman of the Board and CEO, \nmembers of senior management and others as    \nappropriate regarding matters of interest.    \nCommittees The Board\u2019s standing committees,   \ntheir membership and the number of meetings in\n2020 are set forth below.

The Board has oversight for the      \nCompany\u2019s global ERM framework, which         \nintegrates the roles of the Company\u2019s risk    \nmanagement functions into a holistic          \nenterprise to facilitate the incorporation of \nrisk assessment into decision-making processes\nacross the Company, and is responsible for    \nhelping to ensure that the Company\u2019s risks are\nmanaged in a sound manner. The Board regularly\nreviews the Company\u2019s risks and the           \nresponsibilities of management and the Board  \ncommittees to assist the Board in its risk    \noversight. The Board committees assist the    \nBoard in oversight of the risks set forth     \nbelow, coordinating as appropriate. In        \naddition, the entire Board receives reporting \non a quarterly basis regarding cross-         \nenterprise risks, including strategic,        \nreputational, and culture, values and conduct \nrisk. The committees report to the entire     \nBoard on a regular basis and have overlapping \ndirectors, invite Chairs of other committees  \nand other directors to attend meetings, as    \nappropriate given topics of discussion, and   \nhold joint meetings as necessary to discharge \ntheir duties.                                 \n                                              \n  Coordination Among Board Committees         \n  Regarding Risk                              \n  Oversight                                   \n                                              \nThe Board has also authorized the Firm Risk   \nCommittee, a management committee appointed   \nand co-chaired by the CEO and CRO that        \nincludes the most senior officers of the      \nCompany, including the CRO, CLO and CFO, to   \noversee the Company\u2019s global ERM framework.   \nThe Firm Risk Committee\u2019s responsibilities    \ninclude oversight of the Company\u2019s risk       \nmanagement principles, procedures and limits  \nand the monitoring of capital levels and      \nmaterial market, credit, operational, model,  \nliquidity, legal, compliance and reputational \nrisk matters, and other risks, as appropriate,\nand the steps management has taken to monitor \nand manage such risks. The Company\u2019s risk     \nmanagement is further discussed in Part II,   \nItem 7A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020     \n(2020 Form 10-K). Board Oversight of          \nCybersecurity Risk Cybersecurity risk is      \noverseen by the Board as well as the          \nOperations and Technology Committee. The      \nOperations and Technology Committee has       \nprimary responsibility for oversight of       \noperations, technology and operational risk,  \nincluding information security, fraud, vendor,\ndata protection and privacy, business         \ncontinuity and resilience, and cybersecurity  \nrisks (including review of cybersecurity risks\nagainst established risk methodologies). In   \naccordance with its charter, the Operations   \nand Technology Committee receives regular     \nreporting at each quarterly meeting from      \nsenior officers in Operations, Technology and \nFirm Resilience and the Firm Risk Management  \nDepartment on operational risk and the steps  \nmanagement has taken to monitor and control   \nsuch exposures. Such reporting includes       \nupdates on the Company\u2019s cybersecurity        \nprogram, the external threat environment and  \nthe Company\u2019s programs to address and mitigate\nthe risks associated with the evolving        \ncybersecurity threat environment.             \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement39  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS  \n                                \nThe Operations and Technology Committee also  \nreceives an annual independent assessment of  \nkey aspects of the Company\u2019s cybersecurity    \nprogram from an external party and holds joint\nmeetings with the Audit Committee and Risk    \nCommittee as necessary and appropriate. The   \nBoard or the Operations and Technology        \nCommittee reviews and approves the Global     \nCybersecurity Program Policy, the Global      \nInformation Security Program Policy and the   \nGlobal Technology Policy at least annually.   \nThe Chair of the Operations and Technology    \nCommittee regularly reports to the full Board \non cybersecurity risks and other matters      \nreviewed by the Operations and Technology     \nCommittee. In addition, the full Board        \nreceives separate presentations on            \ncybersecurity risk and all Board members are  \ninvited to attend Operations and Technology   \nCommittee meetings and have access to meeting \nmaterials. Senior management, including the   \nsenior officers mentioned above, discuss      \ncybersecurity developments with the Chairs of \nthe Operations and Technology Committee and   \nthe Risk Committee between Board and committee\nmeetings, as necessary. The Operations and    \nTechnology Committee meets regularly in       \nexecutive session with the CRO and Head of    \nTechnology, Operations and Firm Resilience.   \nAssessment of Leadership Structure and Risk   \nOversight The Board has determined that its   \nleadership structure is appropriate for the   \nCompany. Mr. Gorman\u2019s role as CEO, his        \nexisting relationship with the Board, his     \nunderstanding of Morgan Stanley\u2019s businesses  \nand strategy, and his professional experience \nand leadership skills uniquely position him to\nserve as Chairman, while the Company\u2019s        \nIndependent Lead Director position enhances   \nthe overall independent functioning of the    \nBoard. The Board believes that the combination\nof the Chairman and CEO, the Independent Lead \nDirector and the Chairs of the Audit, CMDS,   \nNominating and Governance, Operations and     \nTechnology, and Risk Committees provides the  \nappropriate leadership to help ensure         \neffective risk oversight by the Board.        \nCompensation Governance and Risk Management   \nThe CMDS Committee actively engages in its    \nduties and follows procedures intended to     \nensure excellence in compensation governance. \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee has the power to      \n     hire and fire independent compensation   \n     consultants, legal counsel,              \n     orfinancial or other advisors as it may  \n     deem necessary to assist it in the       \n     performance of its duties and            \n     responsibilities.The CMDS Committee has  \n     retained an                              \n     independent compensation consultant,     \n     Pay Governance, to assist the            \n     CMDSCommittee in collecting and          \n     evaluating external market data          \n     regarding executive compensation and     \n     performanceand to advise the CMDS        \n     Committee on developing trends and best  \n     practices in executive compensation and  \n     equityand incentive plan design. In      \n  \u2022  performing these services, Pay           \n     Governance attends meetings of the CMDS  \n     Committeeregularly, including portions   \n     of the meetings without management       \n     present, and separately with the         \n     CMDSCommittee                            \n     Chair.

The Board believes that a      \ndirector\u2019s total compensation should include a\nsignificant equity component because it       \nbelieves that this more closely aligns the    \nlong-term interests of directors with those of\nshareholders and provides a continuing        \nincentive for directors to foster the         \nCompany\u2019s success. In furtherance of these    \ngoals, our directors are bound by an equity   \nownership requirement of five times the annual\ncash Board retainer, and a shareholder-       \napproved annual compensation (cash and equity)\nlimit of $750,000. Directors\u2019 compensation is \ndetermined by the Board, and the Nominating   \nand Governance Committee makes recommendations\nto the Board based on periodic benchmarking   \nassessments and advice received from FW Cook, \nits independent advisor.

The Audit Committee   \npre-approves categories of audit and permitted\nnon-audit services that Deloitte & Touche may \nperform for the Company and sets budgeted fee \nlevels for such services. The Company reviews \nproposed engagements, in conjunction with     \nDeloitte & Touche, to confirm the proposed    \nengagements fit within a category of pre-     \napproved services and such engagements are    \ndocumented and reported to the Audit Committee\non a quarterly basis. Any proposed service    \ncategory, engagement or budgeted fee          \nadjustment that has not been pre-approved by  \nthe Audit Committee may be approved by the    \nAudit Committee Chair between regularly       \nscheduled quarterly meetings and reported to  \nthe Audit Committee at its next quarterly     \nmeeting. Any fees for services in excess of   \nthe pre-approved budgeted fees must be        \nspecifically approved. In 2020 and 2019, all  \nof Deloitte & Touche\u2019s fees were approved by  \nthe Audit Committee.

At the 2020 \nannual meeting of stockholders, approximately \n94% of the votes cast were in favor of our    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In light of the        \nsignificant majority of votes cast in favor of\nthe 2019 compensation of our NEOs, the CMDS   \nCommittee maintained its performance-based    \napproach to executive compensation for 2020   \nand believes that our current program         \nappropriately links the compensation of our   \nNEOs to performance and properly aligns the   \ninterests of our NEOs with those of our       \nshareholders. As discussed in the CD&A, the   \n2020 pay decision for the CEO was made by the \nCMDS Committee, in consultation with the full \nBoard. Based on an evaluation of 2020 Company \nand CEO performance, including record         \nfinancial performance and significant progress\nin implementing a long-term strategy that has \nled to transformational change and a resilient\nbusiness model, the CMDS Committee set CEO    \ntotal compensation for 2020 at $33 million    \nwith shareholder-aligned features.

Early in the crisis,   \nthe Company committed to making no reductions \nin its workforce through 2020, providing      \nreassurance to its employees in a very        \ndifficult time. The Company also implemented  \nchanges in the best interest of its employees \nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic,         \nincluding having the vast majority of its     \nemployees work from home and providing        \nproductivity resources when necessary, while  \nimplementing additional safety measures for   \nemployees continuing critical on-site work,   \nCOVID-19 specific medical benefits, extended  \nchildcare benefits, mental health resources   \nand modified work schedules. The Company also \nstrengthened its commitment to diversity and  \ninclusion under Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership. As   \npart of its continuing efforts in this area,  \nthe Company added a commitment to diversity   \nand inclusion as its fifth core value and     \nannounced the creation of the Institute for   \nInclusion, a Company-wide effort chaired by   \nMr. Gorman with the mission to invest in      \nunderserved communities, advance equity       \nthrough giving, and drive workplace diversity \nand inclusion.

Company and CEO        \nperformance in 2020 were strong, and the CMDS \nCommittee determined that a 2020 pay decision \nfor Mr. Gorman of $33 million, up from $27    \nmillion in 2019, was appropriate. Mr. Gorman\u2019s\npay was reduced in 2019 from $29 million in   \n2018, notwithstanding Mr. Gorman\u2019s outstanding\nindividual performance and the Company\u2019s      \nstrong financial performance, in light of the \nCompany\u2019s focus on expense discipline and the \nemployee reduction that occurred at the end of\n2019. The reduction of Mr. Gorman\u2019s           \ncompensation in 2019 illustrates the pay for  \nperformance-based nature of the Company\u2019s     \ncompensation framework. Section 3.2 contains  \nmore details about individual NEO performance.\nSection 4.1 contains the 2020 compensation    \ndecisions for each NEO, which follow a similar\nperformance evaluation process.               \n                                              \n  MS 2020                   2020 CEO          \n  Performance               Compensation      \n  Evaluation                Elements ($MM)    \n                                              \n                                              \n     $33\u00a0million is the amount the CMDS       \n     Committee awarded to the CEO in early    \n  *  2021 for                                 \n     2020 performance. This amount differs    \n     from the SECrequired disclosure in the   \n     \u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table.\u201d       \n                                              \nThe alignment of Mr. Gorman\u2019s pay with Company\nperformance can also be demonstrated over the \nlonger term. A significant portion of CEO pay \nis delivered through equity awards, the       \nrealizable value of which increases or        \ndecreases over time with stock price          \nperformance. Mr. Gorman\u2019s total realizable pay\nover the 2018\u20132020 period was approximately   \n12% greater than his total pay as reported in \nthe \u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table\u201d for the \nrelevant years, while the Company\u2019s three-year\nTSR for the same period was higher at 31%.    \nRealizable pay reflects the current aggregate \nvalue of base salary, cash bonus and equity   \nawards disclosed in the 2018, 2019 and 2020   \nproxy statements, with equity awards valued   \nusing the closing price of the Company\u2019s      \ncommon stock on December 31, 2020 and         \nperformance-vested awards valued based on     \nperformance at target. NEO pay in a given year\nis typically delivered in a combination of    \nfixed compensation (generally, base salary),  \ncash bonus, and deferred incentive            \ncompensation provided in restricted stock     \nunits (RSUs) and a long-term incentive program\n(LTIP) award in the form of performance stock \nunits. In determining the portions of         \ncompensation to award as cash bonus, deferred \nincentive compensation, RSUs and LTIP awards, \nthe CMDS Committee considers applicable       \nregulatory requirements and guidelines for    \ndeferral, as well as market practices. A      \nsignificant portion of pay is deferred,       \nawarded in equity, subject to future stock    \nprice performance and cancellation and        \nclawback and, in the case of LTIP awards,     \nsubject to future achievement of specified    \nfinancial objectives over a three-year period.\n                                         \n  56Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \nThese compensation elements support the       \nCompany\u2019s key compensation objectives,        \ndiscussed in Section 2, including delivering  \npay for sustainable performance.              \n                                              \n                                              \n                          \u202275% of 2020        \n                          CEO incentive       \n                          compensation        \n                          is deferred         \n                          over three          \n                          years               \n                          \u2022Clawbacks          \n      Deferred            cover material      \n      Incentive           adverse             \n      Compensation        outcomes, even      \n                          absent              \n                          misconduct          \n                          \u2022No automatic       \n                          vesting on          \n                          change in           \n                          control;            \n                          double trigger      \n                          in place            \n                                              \n                          \u2022CEO                \n                          performance-v\u2026      \n                          award is 50%        \n                          ofincentive         \n                          compensation,       \n      Performance-V\u2026      consistentwith      \n      Long-Term           shareholder         \n      Equity              feedback            \n      Incentive           \u2022Shares earned      \n      Award               can range from      \n                          0 to 1.5x           \n                          target based        \n                          on three-year       \n                          performanceag\u2026      \n                          ROTCE and TSR       \n                          objectives          \n                                              \n                          \u2022100% of CEO        \n                          deferred            \n                          incentive           \n                          compensation        \n                          awarded in          \n                          equity              \n                          \u2022Significant        \n                          portion of          \n                          equity-based        \n      Equity-Based        compensation        \n      Compensation        aligns              \n                          employee            \n                          andshareholder      \n                          interests           \n                          \u2022Meaningful         \n                          share               \n                          ownership and       \n                          retention           \n                          requirements        \n                          further             \n                          shareholderal\u2026      \n                                              \n                          \u2022Prohibitions       \n                          on pledging,        \n                          hedging,            \n                          selling short       \n                          or trading          \n                          derivatives         \n                          \u2022No excise tax      \n                          protection          \n                          upon a              \n      Best Practices      change in           \n                          control             \n                          \u2022Annual risk        \n                          review              \n                          \u2022CMDS               \n                          Committee           \n                          retains             \n                          independent         \n                          compensation        \n                          consultant          \n                                              \n                                              \nSection 4.1 contains the compensation         \ndecisions (both the amount and mix of         \ncompensation elements) for each NEO.

A substantial majority (approximately\n94%) of the votes cast at the May 2020 annual \nmeeting of shareholders were in favor of our  \nannual \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In 2020, we     \ncontinued our engagement program, seeking     \nfeedback from shareholders and proxy advisory \nfirms on a variety of topics, including       \nexecutive compensation, corporate governance, \ndiversity and environmental and social goals. \nThe feedback that we received during the      \nengagement program was conveyed to the CMDS   \nCommittee and the Board. Shareholders who     \nprovided feedback during our engagement       \nprogram generally praised the quality of the  \nCompany\u2019s disclosure and reported that the    \nCommittee\u2019s use of discretion in the          \nadministration of the program is reasonable   \nand that executive compensation at Morgan     \nStanley is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. The CMDS Committee factored      \nshareholder feedback, including the \u201cSay on   \nPay\u201d vote results, into its consideration of  \nthe executive compensation structure and      \ndetermination of 2020 NEO pay levels. After   \ncarefully considering shareholder feedback and\nother factors, the CMDS Committee maintained  \nits performance-based approach to executive   \ncompensation for 2020 and increased the       \nproportion of deferred incentive compensation \ngranted to all NEOs in the form of equity-    \nbased awards to 100%.                         \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement57  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \n2.

Framework for Making Compensation Decisions\n3.1 Factors Considered in Compensation        \nDecisions The 2020 compensation of the NEOs   \nwas determined by the CMDS Committee after    \nconsideration of Company business results,    \nstrategic performance and individual          \nperformance, as well as competitor            \ncompensation data and, with respect to the    \nCEO, benchmarking data, and other             \nconsiderations set forth below. Performance   \nPriorities For 2020, a number of quantitative \nand qualitative performance priorities were   \nset by the CMDS Committee and the Board at the\nbeginning of the year. The performance        \npriorities are established based on a         \ndirectional assessment made at the beginning  \nof the year in light of the market            \nenvironment, and the Company\u2019s strategic      \nobjectives and their attainment or non-       \nattainment does not correspond to any specific\ncompensation decision. To inform its decision-\nmaking process for NEO compensation for 2020, \nthe CMDS Committee evaluated Company and      \nindividual performance in light of the pre-   \nestablished performance priorities.

The Company uses \na Comparison Group to understand market       \npractices and trends, evaluate the            \ncompetitiveness of our compensation programs, \nand inform compensation decisions. Our        \nComparison Group consists of companies that   \neither directly compete with the Company for  \nbusiness and/or talent or are global          \norganizations with scope, size or other       \ncharacteristics similar to those of the       \nCompany.                                      \n                    \n  Comparison Group  \n                    \n                                              \n  Bank of America                             \n  Corp.Citigroup         Barclays Plc         \n  Inc.Goldman Sachs      Credit Suisse Group  \n  Group Inc.JPMorgan     Deutsche Bank AG     \n  Chase & Co.Wells       UBS AG               \n  Fargo &                                     \n  Company                                     \n                                              \nBenchmarking Target CEO Pay As discussed in   \nSection 1.2, the CMDS Committee, in           \nconsultation with its independent compensation\nconsultant, Pay Governance, established a     \ntarget range for 2020 compensation for the CEO\nof $28 million or more for performance        \nexceeding expectations to $10 million or less \nfor performance substantially below           \nexpectations. To inform its decision-making   \nwith respect to the appropriate target range, \nthe CMDS Committee reviewed available 2019    \ncompensation levels for the 16 financial      \ncompanies in the S&P 100 index, which are     \nintended to reflect institutions of similar   \nsize, scope and complexity. The CMDS Committee\nthen utilized the range of results as a       \nbenchmark from which to set the target range  \nfor 2020 compensation for the CEO.            \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement59  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \n                                              \n  16 Financial Companies in the S&P 100       \n  Index                                       \n                                              \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                                              \n  Bank of                                     \n  America Corp    AIG                         \n  Citigroup       Allstate                    \n  Inc.

Our goal is always to be in a  \nposition to appoint our most senior executives\nfrom within our Company and to incentivize our\npeople to aspire to senior executive roles. At\nyear end, the CMDS Committee reviewed the     \nrelative differences between the compensation \nfor the CEO and other NEOs and between the    \nNEOs and other members of the Operating       \nCommittee. Input and Recommendations from the \nCEO, Independent Directors and Independent    \nConsultant At the end of the year, Mr. Gorman \npresented the CMDS Committee with performance \nassessments and compensation recommendations  \nfor each NEO, other than himself. The CMDS    \nCommittee reviewed these recommendations with \nits independent compensation consultant to    \nassess whether they were reasonable compared  \nwith the market for executive talent and met  \nin executive session to discuss the           \nperformance of our CEO and the other NEOs and \nto determine their compensation. In addition, \nthe CMDS Committee and Board reviewed proposed\nNEO incentive compensation with Mr. Gorman,   \nand the CMDS Committee reviewed CEO           \ncompensation with the Board (other than Mr.   \nGorman). Compensation Expense Considerations  \nPrior to determining individual NEO incentive \ncompensation, the CMDS Committee reviewed and \nconsidered the relationship between Company   \nperformance, total compensation expense (which\nincludes fixed compensation costs such as base\nsalaries, allowances, benefits, commissions   \nand amortization of prior deferred            \ncompensation awards), and incentive           \ncompensation as a subset of overall           \ncompensation expense. This exercise furthers  \nthe balancing of the objectives of delivering \nreturns for shareholders, while providing     \nappropriate rewards to motivate superior      \nindividual performance. Global Regulatory     \nPrinciples The Company\u2019s compensation         \npractices are subject to oversight by our     \nregulators in the U.S. and internationally.   \nFor example, the Company is subject to the    \nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s (Federal Reserve)     \nguidance that is designed to help ensure that \nincentive compensation paid by banking        \norganizations does not encourage imprudent    \nrisk-taking that threatens the organizations\u2019 \nsafety and soundness. The Company is also     \nsubject to the compensation-related provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the         \nremuneration code of the U.K. Financial       \nConduct Authority and the U.K. Prudential     \nRegulation Authority (U.K. PRA) Rulebook,     \nwhich prescribes the compensation structure   \nfor certain employees who are identified as   \nmaterial risk takers. Tax Deductibility       \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code   \n(Section 162(m)) limits the tax deductibility \nof compensation for certain executive officers\nthat is more than $1 million. The CMDS        \nCommittee continues to have the flexibility to\npay nondeductible compensation if it believes \nit is in the best interests of the Company.   \n                                         \n  60Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \n3.2 Evaluating Company and Individual         \nPerformance for Alignment with Executive      \nCompensation As set forth in Section 1.3, in  \ndetermining the annual incentive compensation \nof the CEO and other NEOs, the CMDS Committee \nweighed the Company\u2019s overall financial       \nperformance and, as applicable, business unit \nperformance and achievement of its long-term  \nstrategic objectives.

Each NEO   \nreceives a base salary and is eligible to     \nreceive discretionary annual incentive        \ncompensation for prior-year performance.      \nAnnual incentive compensation is intended to  \nreward NEOs for achievement of the Company\u2019s  \nfinancial and strategic objectives over the   \nprior year and is delivered in a mix of a cash\nbonus and deferred incentive compensation in  \nthe form of deferred equity. The amount of    \nincentive compensation that is deferred is    \nbased on a deferral table, which results in a \nmore significant deferral at higher incentive \ncompensation levels. For 2020, the Committee  \ndid not grant deferred cash-based awards and  \ninstead granted additional RSUs, resulting in \n100% of each NEO\u2019s deferred incentive         \ncompensation being equity-based, further      \naligning compensation with shareholders\u2019      \ninterests. The LTIP awards, which are deferred\nequity awards that are subject to future      \nachievement of specified financial objectives \nover a three-year period, are described in    \nmore detail in

Company\u2019s long-term \nfinancial performance and reinforce the NEO\u2019s \naccountability for the achievement of the     \nCompany\u2019s financial and strategic objectives  \nby directly linking the ultimate realizable   \naward value to prospective performance against\ncore financial measures over a three-year     \nperiod. Previously, LTIP awards vested and    \nconverted to shares after three years only if \nthe Company achieved predetermined performance\ngoals with respect to ROE and relative TSR.   \nThe CMDS Committee amended the LTIP with      \nrespect to 2021\u20132023 LTIP awards to replace   \nthe ROE performance goal with an ROTCE        \nperformance goal in order to more directly    \nalign the LTIP awards with the Company\u2019s      \nstrategic objectives. General Terms The       \n2021\u20132023 LTIP awards will vest and convert to\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the   \nend of the three-year performance period upon \nthe Company\u2019s achievement of predetermined    \nperformance objectives with respect to ROTCE  \nand relative TSR, as set forth below, over the\nperiod beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending\non December 31, 2023. These performance       \nobjectives are consistent with, and drive,    \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s long-term strategy,          \nreflective in the strategic objectives in     \nSection 1.3 and the performance priorities in \nSection 3.1. While each participant was       \nawarded a target number of performance stock  \nunits, the actual number of units earned could\nvary from zero, if performance objectives are \nnot met, to up to 1.5 times target, if        \nperformance objectives are meaningfully       \nexceeded. No participant will receive any     \nportion of the LTIP award if the threshold    \nperformance objectives are not met. The LTIP  \nawards remain subject to cancellation upon    \ncertain events until they are converted to    \nshares of Company common stock. If, after     \nconversion of the LTIP awards, the CMDS       \nCommittee determines that the performance     \ncertified by the CMDS Committee was based on  \nmaterially inaccurate financial statements,   \nthen the shares delivered will be subject to  \nclawback by the Company. Performance          \nObjectives One-half of the target LTIP award  \nis earned based on the Company\u2019s average ROTCE\nover the three-year performance period (MS    \nAverage ROTCE). The other half of the target  \nLTIP award is earned based on the Company\u2019s   \nTSR over the three-year period (MS TSR)       \nrelative to the TSR of the S&P 500 Financials \nIndex over the same three-year period (Index  \nGroup TSR). The number of stock units         \nultimately earned will be determined by       \nmultiplying each half of the target award by a\nmultiplier as follows (for performance between\ntwo thresholds, straight-line interpolation   \napplies):                                     \n                                         \n    MS Average ROTCE*      Multiplier    \n    15% or more                  1.50    \n    13%                          1.00    \n    8%                           0.50    \n    Less than 8%                 0.00    \n                                         \n                                      \n    Relative TSR**      Multiplier    \n    25% or more               1.50    \n    0%                        1.00    \n    -50%                      0.50    \n    Less than -50%            0.00    \n                                      \n                                              \n     MS Average ROTCE, for this purpose,      \n     excludes: (a) the impact of debt         \n     valuation                                \n     adjustment; (b) certain gains or losses  \n     associated withthe sale of specified     \n     businesses; (c) certain gains or losses  \n     associated with specified legal          \n     settlements relating to business         \n     activitiesconducted prior to January\u00a01,  \n     2011; and (d) specified cumulative       \n     catch-up adjustments resulting from      \n     changes in, or application of, anew      \n     accounting rule that are not applied     \n  *  on a full retrospective basis.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      Relative TSR is determined by           \n      subtracting the Index Group TSR from    \n  **  the MS TSR;                             \n      however, if performance for the period  \n      is negative,the multiplier may not      \n      exceed 1.00.                            \n                                              \nAs described in further detail in note 2 to   \n\u201c2020 Grants of Plan-Based Awards,\u201d each of   \nour NEOs received an LTIP award in 2020 on    \nsimilar terms as described above.             \n                                         \n  66Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \nThe CMDS Committee has consistently set       \nchallenging performance objectives for our    \nLTIP awards. The variability over time of the \npercentage of our LTIP awards that have been  \nearned demonstrates a strong pay-for-         \nperformance link. Since the inception of the  \nprogram in 2009, the average of the payouts of\nall nine LTIP awards up to and including the  \n2018 LTIP awards is 98% of target.            \n                            \n  LTIP Program Performance  \n                            \nAs described in note 3 to \u201c2020 Option        \nExercises and Stock Vested,\u201d LTIP awards      \ngranted in 2018 (2018 LTIP award) vested at   \n150% of target, based on performance over the \nthree-year performance period ended December  \n31, 2020. 4.4 Additional Compensation         \nPractices Robust Clawback Policies and        \nProcedures Throughout the year, employee      \nconduct matters that are escalated through the\nCompany\u2019s Global Conduct Risk Program are     \nreviewed to determine whether they present    \nsituations that could require clawback or     \ncancellation of previously awarded            \ncompensation, as well as downward adjustments \nto current-year compensation. Clawbacks of    \npreviously awarded compensation are reviewed  \nquarterly with the Employee Discipline        \nOversight Committee (a committee of senior    \nmanagement currently composed of the CFO, CLO,\nCRO, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Human         \nResources Officer and Chief Compliance        \nOfficer) and reported to the CMDS Committee.  \nIn addition, the Global Incentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy adopted by the CMDS         \nCommittee sets forth standards for managers on\nthe use of discretion when making annual      \ncompensation decisions and considerations for \nassessing risk management and outcomes.       \nFurther, the Company\u2019s control functions      \nconduct a semiannual review of employee       \nconduct with respect to risk and control      \nmatters, and are asked to identify            \ninappropriate behavior that may not be        \ncaptured through other Company processes. The \nresults of the reviews are reflected in       \nperformance feedback and considered in        \ncompensation decisions. No Change in Control  \nTax Gross-Up Protection NEOs are not          \ncontractually entitled to any golden parachute\nexcise tax protection upon a change in control\nof Morgan Stanley and are not entitled to     \nseverance pay upon termination of employment  \nin excess of broad-based benefits.            \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement67  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \nHealth and Insurance Benefits All NEOs are    \neligible to participate in Company-sponsored  \nhealth and insurance benefit programs         \navailable in the relevant jurisdiction to     \nsimilarly situated employees. In the U.S.,    \nhigher compensated employees pay more to      \nparticipate in the Company\u2019s medical plan.    \nNEOs are also eligible to participate in      \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Executive Health Program,    \nunder which each NEO is eligible to receive   \nCompany-funded access to a private primary    \ncare physician offering on-call services and  \nan annual executive health care assessment.   \nUpon retirement, NEOs are eligible for        \nCompany-paid retiree health coverage for      \nthemselves and eligible dependents. No        \nExecutive Pensions Company-provided retirement\nbenefits in the U.S. include a tax-qualified  \n401(k) plan (401(k) Plan) and a frozen tax-   \nqualified pension plan (the Employees         \nRetirement Plan (ERP)). No NEO is awarded with\ncredited service in excess of his/her actual  \nservice under the ERP. Pension and retirement \nbenefits provided to NEOs are discussed in    \nfurther detail under \u201c2020 Pension Benefits.\u201d \nNo Excessive Perquisites The Company provides \npersonal benefits to certain of the NEOs for  \ncompetitive and security reasons. The         \nCompany\u2019s Board-approved policy authorizes the\nCEO to use the Company\u2019s aircraft. As of      \nJanuary 1, 2010, Mr. Gorman entered into a    \ntime-share agreement with the Company         \npermitting him to reimburse the Company for   \nthe incremental cost of his personal use of   \nthe Company\u2019s aircraft. In 2020, for health   \nand safety reasons, NEOs were authorized to   \nuse the Company\u2019s aircraft and certain NEOs   \nentered into time-share agreements with the   \nCompany permitting them to reimburse the      \nCompany in part for their personal use of the \nCompany\u2019s aircraft. Personal benefits provided\nto NEOs are discussed in further detail under \n\u201c2020 Summary Compensation Table.\u201d No Hedging \nor Pledging Company policy prohibits NEOs from\npledging, selling short, engaging in hedging  \nstrategies or trading derivatives involving   \nMorgan Stanley securities.

Effective after December 31, 2010, the  \nERP was frozen and no further benefit accruals\nwill occur. Benefits are generally payable as \nan annuity at age 65 (or earlier, subject to  \ncertain reductions in the amounts payable).   \nUnder the pre-2004 provisions of the ERP,     \nbenefits are payable in full at age 60 and    \nreduced 4% per year for retirement between    \nages 55 and 60 for employees who retire after \nage 55 with 10 years of service. Before the   \nERP was frozen, annual benefits were equal to \n1% of eligible earnings plus 0.5% of eligible \nearnings in excess of Social Security covered \ncompensation for each year of service.        \nEligible earnings generally included all      \ntaxable compensation, other than certain      \nequity-based and non-recurring amounts, up to \n$170,000 per year. ERP participants who, as of\nJanuary 1, 2004, had age plus service equal to\nat least 65 and who had been credited with    \nfive years of service, received benefits      \ndetermined under the ERP\u2019s pre-2004 benefit   \nformula, if greater.

Notional Leveraged Co-       \nInvestment Plan (LCIP) Under LCIP,            \nparticipants were permitted to allocate a     \nportion of their deferred incentive           \ncompensation to the plan. LCIP is closed to   \nnew participants and has not been offered     \nsince 2008. Participants were permitted to    \nallocate up to 40% of their long-term         \nincentive compensation to LCIP. The Company   \ncontributed a notional investment in an amount\nequal to two times each participant\u2019s         \ncontribution (however, for fiscal 2008,       \nparticipants could elect to forgo the notional\ninvestment). Contributions were notionally    \ninvested by the Company in reference          \ninvestments, which included the Company\u2019s     \nproprietary investment funds, \u201cfunds of funds\u201d\nthat included Company proprietary investment  \nfunds and third-party investment funds, and   \nother third-party investment funds.           \nParticipants generally were entitled to       \nreceive distributions in respect of their     \ncontributions plus any earnings on their      \ncontributions and on the Company notional     \ninvestment on the third anniversary of grant  \nand the tenth anniversary of grant, based on  \nthe valuation of the notional investments and \nany realizations of those investments prior to\nthe scheduled distribution date. Participant  \ndistributions under LCIP are offset by the    \nCompany notional investment, excluding any    \nearnings thereon. The final distributions due \nunder LCIP were made in 2020. Morgan Stanley  \nCompensation Incentive Plan (MSCIP) A portion \nof each participant\u2019s year-end deferred       \nincentive compensation may be granted under   \nMSCIP. Earnings on MSCIP awards are based on  \nthe performance of notional investments       \navailable under the plan and selected by the  \nparticipants. Participants may reallocate such\nbalances periodically, as determined by the   \nplan administrator. Until MSCIP awards reach  \ntheir scheduled distribution date, they are   \nsubject to cancellation and clawback by the   \nCompany. The cancellation and clawback events \napplicable to MSCIP awards held by our NEOs   \nare described in the CD&A and in \u201cPotential   \nPayments upon Termination or Change in        \nControl.\u201d Pre-Tax Incentive Program (PTIP)    \nUnder PTIP, participants were permitted to    \ndefer a portion of their cash bonus or        \ncommissions for one or more fiscal years. The \nplan has been closed to new contributions     \nsince 2003. Earnings on PTIP contributions are\nbased on the performance of notional          \ninvestments available under the plan and      \nselected by the participants. Participants    \ncould generally elect the commencement date   \nfor distributions of their contributions and  \nearnings and the number of annual installments\nover which to receive distributions           \n(generally, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years). Subject to\nearlier distribution on death or termination  \nof employment due to disability, no           \ndistributions may begin prior to the          \nattainment of age 55, and no distribution may \nbegin prior to termination of employment.     \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) RSUs are granted\nunder the Morgan Stanley Equity Incentive     \nCompensation Plan or another Company equity   \nplan as determined by the CMDS Committee. Each\nRSU constitutes a contingent and unsecured    \npromise of the Company to pay the holder one  \nshare of Company common stock on the          \nconversion date of the RSU. The RSUs included \nin this table are considered vested; however, \nthe RSUs are subject to cancellation and      \nclawback if a cancellation or clawback event  \noccurs at any time prior to the scheduled     \nconversion date. The cancellation and clawback\nevents applicable to RSUs held by our NEOs are\ndescribed in the CD&A and in \u201cPotential       \nPayments upon Termination or Change in        \nControl.\u201d                                     \n                                         \n  78Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \nPotential Payments upon Termination or Change \nin Control This section describes and         \nquantifies the benefits and compensation to   \nwhich each NEO would have been entitled under \nour existing plans and arrangements if his    \nemployment had terminated or if the Company   \nhad undergone a change in control, in each    \ncase on December 31, 2020. 1. General Policies\nNo Special Severance Payments Our NEOs would  \nbe entitled to a cash severance payment under \nthe broad-based Morgan Stanley Severance Pay  \nPlan (Severance Plan) in connection with an   \ninvoluntary termination of employment other   \nthan for cause, on the same basis as all other\nemployees, and subject to the NEO executing a \nrelease agreement in a form satisfactory to   \nthe Company. The NEOs are not entitled to any \nadditional or enhanced cash severance payments\nupon any termination of employment under the  \nSeverance Plan or otherwise, or to excise tax \nprotection upon a change in control of the    \nCompany. No Enhanced Termination Payments or  \nBenefits NEOs are entitled to receive post-   \ntermination benefits that are generally       \navailable to all salaried employees, such as  \ndeath, disability and post-retirement welfare \nbenefits, and are eligible for Company-paid   \nretiree medical coverage under the Morgan     \nStanley Grandfathered Retiree Medical Plan for\nthemselves and eligible dependents following  \nany termination of employment with three years\nof service. Following termination of          \nemployment, the NEOs are also entitled to     \namounts, to the extent vested, due under the  \nterms of our pension arrangements, as         \ndescribed under \u201c2020 Pension Benefits,\u201d and  \nour nonqualified deferred compensation plans, \nas described under \u201c2020 Nonqualified Deferred\nCompensation.\u201d Our NEOs are not entitled to   \nspecial or enhanced termination benefits under\nour pension and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation plans as compared to other       \nemployees. Cancellation and Clawback of       \nDeferred Compensation Even if an NEO is       \nconsidered vested in a deferred incentive     \ncompensation award, the award may be subject  \nto cancellation through the distribution date \nin the event the NEO engages in a cancellation\nevent or if a clawback event occurs. In       \ngeneral, a cancellation event includes:       \nengaging in competitive activity during a     \nspecified period following a voluntary        \ntermination of employment; engaging in cause  \n(i.e., a breach of the NEO\u2019s obligation to the\nCompany, including a failure to comply with   \ninternal compliance, ethics or risk management\nstandards and failure or refusal to perform   \nduties satisfactorily, including supervisory  \nand management duties); improper disclosure of\nthe Company\u2019s proprietary information;        \nsolicitation of Company employees, clients or \ncustomers during, and within a specified      \nperiod following termination of, employment;  \nthe making of unauthorized disclosures or     \ndisparaging or defamatory comments about the  \nCompany; resignation from employment without  \nproviding the Company proper advance notice;  \nor the failure to cooperate with or assist the\nCompany in connection with investigations,    \nregulatory matters, lawsuits or arbitrations  \nfollowing termination of employment. Clawback \nof deferred compensation awards by the Company\ncan be triggered through the applicable       \nscheduled distribution date if the NEO had    \nsignificant responsibility for a material     \nadverse outcome for the Company or any of its \nbusinesses or functions, even absent          \nmisconduct, or if the NEO\u2019s act or omission   \n(including with respect to direct supervisory \nresponsibilities) causes a restatement of the \nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial results,     \nviolates the Company\u2019s global risk management \nprinciples, policies and standards, or causes \na loss of revenue associated with a position  \non which the NEO was paid and he operated     \noutside of internal control policies. Further,\nshares resulting from the conversion of LTIP  \nawards are subject to clawback by the Company \nin the event the Company\u2019s achievement of the \nspecified goals was based on materially       \ninaccurate financial statements or other      \nperformance metric criteria. Notice and Non-  \nSolicitation Agreements In addition to the    \ncancellation and clawback events described    \nabove, each NEO is party to a Notice and Non- \nSolicitation Agreement that provides for      \ninjunctive relief and cancellation of deferred\ncompensation awards if the NEO does not       \nprovide 180 days\u2019 advance notice prior to a   \nresignation or if the NEO improperly solicits \nthe Company\u2019s employees, clients or customers \nat any time during employment or the 180 days \nfollowing termination of employment.          \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement79  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  COMPENSATION MATTERS  \n                        \n2.

Because SEC rules\nfor identifying the median compensated        \nemployee for purposes of this disclosure allow\ncompanies to adopt various methodologies and  \nutilize various assumptions, the ratio        \nreported by other companies may not be        \ncomparable to the ratio reported by the       \nCompany. For 2020, our last completed fiscal  \nyear, the median of the annual total          \ncompensation of all employees of the Company  \n(other than the CEO) was $126,470 and the     \nannual total compensation of our CEO, as      \nreported in the \u201c2020 Summary Compensation    \nTable,\u201d was $29,558,524. Based on this        \ninformation, for 2020, the ratio of the annual\ntotal compensation of the CEO to the median of\nthe annual total compensation of all other    \nemployees of the Company was 234 to 1.

Morgan Stanley \nhas robust compensation practices that help   \nensure that compensation and reward decisions \nare made fairly and consistently and are based\non an individual\u2019s role, performance and      \nexperience. The Company reviews compensation  \ndecisions for employees on an ongoing basis,  \nincluding at the point of hire as well as     \nduring our annual compensation process, to    \nhelp ensure that individual compensation      \ndecisions are in line with this philosophy. A \ndiverse workforce is key to our success, and  \nconsistent with that, we are committed to     \ncontinually assessing our rewards structure   \nand decisions to help ensure equity in pay for\nall employees.                                \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement81  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK EXECUTIVE EQUITY       \nOWNERSHIP COMMITMENT Members of the Company\u2019s \nOperating Committee are subject to an Equity  \nOwnership Commitment. The Equity Ownership    \nCommitment requires each of our CEO, CFO and  \nPresident (Covered Officers) to achieve       \nownership of a number of shares of common     \nstock and equity awards with a value equal to \na specified multiple of his base salary within\nfive years. Our CEO is required to achieve    \nownership of shares of common stock and equity\nawards with a value equal to 10 times his base\nsalary and each other Covered Officer is      \nrequired to achieve ownership of shares of    \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to six times his base salary. In        \naddition, Operating Committee members         \n(including all executive officers) are        \nrequired to hold common stock and equity      \nawards equal to a percentage of common stock  \nreceived from equity awards (less allowances  \nfor the payment of any option exercise price  \nand taxes) granted to them for service on the \nOperating Committee (Equity Award Shares) as  \nfollows:                                      \n                                              \n  \u2022  Our CEO is required to retain 75% of     \n     Equity Award Shares.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each of our other Operating Committee    \n     members is required to retain 50% of     \n     Equity Award Shares                      \n     acquired fromequity awards granted       \n     beginning in January 2016 and            \n     thereafter, and 75% of Equity Award      \n  \u2022  Shares acquired fromequity awards        \n     granted prior to                         \n     January 2016; provided that Operating    \n     Committee members who are                \n     CoveredOfficers must retain 75% of all   \n     Equity Award Shares until the            \n     applicable ownership requirement is      \n     met.                                     \n                                              \nThis commitment ties a portion of our         \nOperating Committee members\u2019 net worth to the \nCompany\u2019s stock price and provides a          \ncontinuing incentive for them to work toward  \nsuperior long-term stock price performance.   \nExceptions to the Equity Ownership Commitment \nare subject to the approval of the CMDS       \nCommittee. None of our executive officers     \ncurrently have prearranged trading plans under\nSEC Rule 10b5-1. DIRECTOR EQUITY OWNERSHIP    \nREQUIREMENT Our Corporate Governance Policies \nrequire each independent director to retain   \nownership of a number of shares of Morgan     \nStanley common stock and equity awards with a \nvalue equal to five times the annual cash     \nBoard retainer, and to retain 100% of his or  \nher Morgan Stanley stock unit awards (on an   \nafter-tax basis) until such ownership         \nrequirement is met. In addition, as discussed \nunder \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d our independent\ndirectors generally receive an equity award   \nupon initial election to the Board and receive\nan annual equity award thereafter with a grant\ndate fair value of $250,000 (prorated in the  \ncase of the initial award) as part of their   \ndirector compensation. Fifty percent of each  \nequity award granted to our independent       \ndirectors does not become payable until the   \ndirector retires from the Board (and may be   \ndeferred beyond retirement at the director\u2019s  \nelection). We believe these equity ownership  \nopportunities and requirements enhance the    \nalignment of independent directors\u2019 interests \nwith the long-term interests of our           \nshareholders. COMPANY HEDGING POLICIES Company\npolicy prohibits directors, officers as       \ndefined by Section 16 of the Securities       \nExchange Act of 1934, including the Company\u2019s \nexecutive officers, and other members of the  \nCompany\u2019s Operating Committee from pledging,  \nselling short, engaging in hedging strategies \nor trading derivatives involving Morgan       \nStanley securities, including securities      \ngranted in connection with compensation or    \notherwise held. Company policy permits other  \nemployees to transact in covered calls and    \nprotective puts with respect to currently     \nowned and saleable Morgan Stanley shares,     \nsubject to varying holding and window period  \nrequirements. No employee may hedge the value \nof outstanding restricted stock units,        \nperformance stock units or other equity-based \ncompensation awards.                          \n                                         \n  82Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK  \n                          \nSTOCK OWNERSHIP OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND     \nDIRECTORS The following table sets forth the  \nbeneficial ownership of common stock as of    \nFebruary 26, 2021 by our CEO and the other    \nexecutive officers named in the \u201c2020 Summary \nCompensation Table\u201d (our NEOs), directors, the\ndirector nominee and by all of our directors  \nand executive officers as a group.

The EICP was originally      \napproved by shareholders on April 10, 2007 and\nwas last amended in 2017, with approval of a  \nsignificant majority of shareholders, to      \nincrease the number of shares of common stock \navailable for grant by 50 million shares. The \nproposed 60 million additional shares, which  \nrepresents approximately 3.3% of the common   \nshares of the Company outstanding as of       \nJanuary 29, 2021, is expected to allow us to  \nmake grants under the EICP for approximately  \nthree years. Morgan Stanley delivers a        \nsignificant portion of incentive compensation \nfor eligible employees in deferred equity     \nawards (RSUs) that are impacted by future     \nstock price performance over a multi-year     \nperiod and, for senior executives,            \nperformance-vested stock units that only      \ndeliver value if the Company meets specific   \nperformance targets after three years (LTIP   \nawards). We believe this approach to executive\ncompensation aligns the interests of the      \nCompany\u2019s employees with those of its         \nshareholders and is consistent with executive \nmotivation, best practices, and regulatory    \nprinciples. The Board believes that the EICP  \namendments are in the best interest of        \nshareholders and supports this proposal for   \nthe following reasons:                        \n                                              \n     Beginning with the 2020 year-end         \n     incentive compensation award grants,     \n     the Companyreduced the group of          \n     eligibleemployees receivingdeferred      \n     cash-based awards and instead            \n  \u2022  grantedmoredeferred incentive            \n     compensation awardssolely in the form    \n     of RSUs. This adjustment to our pay mix  \n     increased the use of                     \n     equity awards, which further alignsthe   \n     interests of the Company\u2019s employees     \n     with those of its shareholders.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     In January 2021,                         \n     approximately21.8million shares          \n     underlying equity awards were granted    \n     as part of the2020\u00a0year-end              \n     compensation process and835,359shares    \n     (representing the target number of       \n  \u2022  performance stockunits) were granted as  \n     LTIP awards. After these grants, as of   \n     January29, 2021, approximately52million  \n     shares wereavailable for future equity   \n     awards under the EICP and                \n     the Company\u2019s legacy equity plans, with  \n     only36.6million ofsuch shares available  \n     under the EICP.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Company strives to maximize          \n     employee and shareholder alignment       \n     through the use of deferred equity       \n     awards,while minimizing dilution. The    \n     Company has evaluated whether to return  \n     to shareholders to request approval      \n     ofadditional shares at the 2021 annual   \n     meeting of shareholders and has          \n     determined to request an                 \n     additional60millionshares, which we      \n  \u2022  expect would allow us to                 \n     make grants under the EICP for           \n     approximatelythreeyears. The\u00a0            \n     sharerepurchase program offsets the      \n     dilutive impact of these                 \n     additional shares. The Company           \n     repurchasedapproximately$15.3billion of  \n     sharesfrom2017through2020,and the        \n     Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized  \n     the repurchase of upto $10\u00a0billion of    \n     outstanding common stockfor2021.         \n                                              \n                                              \n     If the proposed amendments are not       \n     approved,the Company will                \n     not have sufficient shares for grant     \n     needs and willbe compelled to increase   \n  \u2022  the cash-based component of employee     \n     compensation, which is contrary to       \n     regulatoryguidance                       \n     and could reduce the alignment of        \n     employee and shareholder interests.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     If the proposed amendments are not       \n     approved, the Companywill lose a         \n     critical tool for recruiting, retaining  \n  \u2022  andmotivating employees. The Company     \n     would thus be at a competitive           \n     disadvantage in attracting and           \n     retaining talent.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     The terms of our equity and other        \n     annual and long-term incentive           \n     compensation awards and our employee     \n  \u2022  policies are alldesigned to protect      \n     shareholder interests and encourage      \n     employees to focus on the long-term      \n     success of the Company.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Employees typically cannot fully         \n     monetize equity awards until three       \n  \u00b0  years after                              \n     grant.

SUMMARY OF THE EICP AS  \nPROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AND RESTATED A copy of \nthe EICP as proposed to be amended is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and the    \nfollowing summary is qualified in its entirety\nby reference thereto. Other than the          \namendments to increase the number of shares   \navailable under the EICP extend the term of   \nthe EICP by five years, and remove references \nto Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code\nthat have become obsolete as a result of the  \nTax Cuts and Jobs Act, for which we are       \nseeking approval under this Item 4, the EICP  \nterms remain unchanged. The capitalized terms \nnot otherwise defined in this summary shall   \nhave the meaning assigned to them in the EICP.\nPurposes and Eligibility The primary purposes \nof the EICP are to attract, retain and        \nmotivate employees, to compensate them for    \ntheir contributions to our growth and profits \nand to encourage them to own shares of our    \ncommon stock to align their interests with    \nthose of shareholders. The EICP authorizes the\nissuance of awards (Awards) to all officers,  \nother employees (including newly hired        \nemployees) and consultants of the Company,    \nnon-employee directors of our subsidiaries and\nemployees and consultants of joint ventures,  \npartnerships or similar business organizations\nin which we or one of our subsidiaries has an \nequity or similar interest (Eligible          \nIndividuals). As of March 2021, there were    \napproximately 70,700 Eligible Individuals who \nwere employees of the Company and its         \nsubsidiaries. The basis for participation in  \nthe EICP is the CMDS\u2019s determination, in its  \nsole discretion, that an award to an eligible \nparticipant will further the EICP\u2019s purposes  \nof attracting, retaining and motivating       \nemployees, to compensate them for their       \ncontributions to our growth and profits and to\nencourage them to own shares of our common    \nstock to align their interests with those of  \nshareholders. In exercising its discretion,   \nthe CMDS will consider the recommendations of \nmanagement and the purposes of the EICP.      \nAdministration The CMDS Committee will        \nadminister the EICP, select the Eligible      \nIndividuals who receive Awards (Participants) \nand determine the form and terms of the       \nAwards, including any vesting, exercisability,\npayment or other restrictions. Subject to     \ncertain limitations, the CMDS Committee may   \ndelegate some or all of its authority to one  \nor more administrators (e.g., one or more CMDS\nCommittee members or one or more of our       \nofficers).                                    \n                                         \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement87  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  OTHER COMPANY PROPOSAL  \n                          \nShares Available Under the EICP Since initial \nshareholder approval of the EICP in 2007, the \ntotal number of shares of common stock that   \nmay be delivered pursuant to Awards will be   \n433 million (which takes into account the     \nproposed 60 million share increase), of which \napproximately 336.4 million were already      \ngranted as of January 29, 2021, subject to    \nadjustment pursuant to the EICP\u2019s share       \ncounting rules as described below and to      \nreflect certain transactions. Shares delivered\nunder the EICP may be either treasury shares  \nor newly issued shares. In addition to the    \noverall limit, the EICP limits the number of  \nshares of common stock that may be subject to \nstock option and stock appreciation right     \n(SAR) awards in any single year. Share        \nCounting Rules When the CMDS Committee grants \nan Award, the full number of shares subject to\nthe Award is charged against the number of    \nshares that remain available for delivery     \npursuant to Awards. After grant, the number of\nshares subject to any portion of an Award that\nis canceled or that expires without having    \nbeen settled in shares, or that is settled    \nthrough the delivery of consideration other   \nthan shares, will be available for new Awards.\nIf shares are tendered or withheld to pay the \nexercise price of an Award or to satisfy a tax\nwithholding obligation, those tendered or     \nwithheld shares will be available for new     \nAwards.

How \nDo I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares    \nHeld in Employee Plans? If you hold shares in,\nor have been awarded stock units under,       \ncertain employee plans, you will separately   \nreceive directions on how to submit your      \nvoting instructions. Shares held in the       \nfollowing employee plans also are subject to  \nthe following rules: 401(k) Plan. The Northern\nTrust Company (Northern Trust), the 401(k)    \nPlan\u2019s trustee, must receive your voting      \ninstructions for the common stock held on your\nbehalf in the 401(k) Plan on or before May 17,\n2021. If Northern Trust does not receive your \nvoting instructions by that date, it will vote\nsuch shares together with other unvoted,      \nforfeited and unallocated shares in the 401(k)\nPlan in the same proportion as the voting     \ninstructions that it receives from other      \nparticipants in the 401(k) Plan. On March 22, \n2021, there were 30,040,205 shares in the     \n401(k) Plan. Other Equity-Based Plans.

The Board or      \nCommittee may modify, amend, suspend or       \nterminate the Plan in whole or in part at any \ntime and may modify or amend the terms and    \nconditions of any outstanding Award (including\nby amending or supplementing the relevant     \nAward Document at any time); provided,        \nhowever, that no such modification, amendment,\nsuspension or termination shall, without a    \nParticipant\u2019s consent,                        \n                                          \n  Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy StatementA-7  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n           \n  ANNEX A  \n           \nmaterially adversely affect that Participant\u2019s\nrights with respect to any Award previously   \nmade; and provided, further, that the         \nCommittee shall have the right at any time,   \nwithout a Participant\u2019s consent and whether or\nnot the Participant\u2019s rights are materially   \nadversely affected thereby, to amend or modify\nthe Plan or any Award under the Plan in any   \nmanner that the Committee considers necessary \nor advisable to comply with any law,          \nregulation, ruling, judicial decision,        \naccounting standards, regulatory guidance or  \nother legal requirement. Notwithstanding the  \npreceding sentence, neither the Board nor the \nCommittee may accelerate the payment or       \nsettlement of any Award, including, without   \nlimitation, any Award subject to a prior      \ndeferral election, that constitutes a deferral\nof compensation for purposes of Section 409A  \nexcept to the extent such acceleration would  \nnot result in the Participant incurring       \ninterest or additional tax under Section 409A.\nNo amendment to the Plan may render any Board \nmember who is not a Company employee eligible \nto receive an Award at any time while such    \nmember is serving on the Board. To the extent \nrequired by applicable law or the rules of the\nNew York Stock Exchange, amendments to the    \nPlan shall not be effective unless they are   \napproved by Morgan Stanley\u2019s stockholders.    \n                                          \n  A-8Morgan Stanley 2021 Proxy Statement  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOur Core Values Since our founding in 1935,   \nMorgan Stanley has consistently delivered     \nfirst-class business in a first-class way.    \nUnderpinning all that we do are five core     \nvalues.                                       \n                                              \n  DO THE RIGHT           COMMIT TO DIVERSITY  \n  THING                  & INCLUSION          \n                         \u2022Value individual    \n                         and cultural         \n                         differences as a     \n                         defining strength    \n                         \u2022Champion an         \n                         environment where    \n  \u2022Act with              all                  \n  integrity              employees            \n  \u2022Think like an         feel a sense of      \n  owner to create        belonging\u2014are        \n  long-term              heard, seen and      \n  shareholder value      respected            \n  \u2022Value and reward      \u2022Expect everyone to  \n  honesty,               challenge behavior   \n  character and          counter to           \n  diversity              our culture of       \n                         inclusion            \n                         \u2022Attract, develop    \n                         and retain talent    \n                         reflecting the full  \n                         diversity of         \n                         society              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  PUT CLIENTS FIRST      GIVE BACK            \n  \u2022Keep the              \u2022Serve our           \n  client's               communities          \n  interests first        generously with      \n  \u2022Work with             ourexpertise, time   \n  colleagues to          and money\u2022Build a    \n  deliver the best       better firm for the  \n  of                     future by            \n  theFirm to             contributing toour   \n  every                  culture\u2022Develop our  \n  client\u2022Listen to       talent through       \n  what the client        mentoring and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \n  is saying and          sponsorship          \n  needs                                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  LEAD WITH EXCEPTIONAL IDEAS                 \n  \u2022Win by breaking new ground                 \n  \u2022Leverage                                   \n  different perspectives to gain new          \n  insight                                     \n  \u2022Drive innovation\u2022Be vigilant about         \n  what we can do better                       \n                                              \n\u201cOur DNA, our culture and our history are     \nrooted in serving our clients.\u201d \u2013 James P.    \nGorman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  TABLE OF CONTENTS                           \n                                              \n"
