In addition,\nrestrictive laws and\nregulations applicable\nto certain financial\nservices institutions,\nwhich may prohibit us\nfrom engaging in\ncertain transactions\nand impose more\nstringent capital and\nliquidity\nrequirements, can put\nus at a competitive\ndisadvantage to\ncompetitors in certain\nbusinesses not subject\nto these same\nrequirements.

We\noperate as a BHC and\nFHC under the BHC Act\nand are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve. In\nparticular, we are\nsubject to (among\nother things):\nsignificant regulation\nand supervision;\nintensive scrutiny of\nour businesses and\nplans for expansion of\nthose businesses;\nlimitations on\nactivities; a systemic\nrisk regime that\nimposes heightened\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements;\nrestrictions on\nactivities and\ninvestments imposed by\na section of the BHC\nAct added by the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) referred\nto\n\nas the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d;\nand comprehensive\nderivatives\nregulation.

The BHC\nAct limits the\nactivities of BHCs and\nFHCs and grants the\nFederal Reserve\nauthority to limit our\nability to conduct\nactivities. We must\nobtain the Federal\nReserve\u2019s approval\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both in the\nU.S. and\ninternationally.\n\nThe BHC Act\ngrandfathers\n\u201cactivities related to\nthe trading, sale or\ninvestment in\ncommodities and\nunderlying physical\nproperties,\u201d provided\nthat we were engaged\nin \u201cany of such\nactivities as of\nSeptember 30, 1997 in\nthe U.S.\u201d and provided\nthat certain other\nconditions that are\nwithin our reasonable\ncontrol are satisfied.\nWe currently engage in\nour commodities\nactivities pursuant to\nthe BHC Act\ngrandfather exemption,\nas well as other\nauthorities under the\nBHC Act.\n\nActivities\nRestrictions under the\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\nbanking entities,\nincluding us and our\naffiliates, from\nengaging in certain\nproprietary trading\nactivities, as defined\nin the Volcker Rule,\nsubject to exemptions\nfor underwriting,\nmarket-making, risk-\nmitigating hedging and\ncertain other\nactivities. The\nVolcker Rule also\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule, subject to a\nnumber of exemptions\nand exclusions. In\naddition, there is an\nextension until July\n2022 for conformance\nfor certain legacy\ncovered funds.\n\nCapital Requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve\nestablishes capital\nrequirements largely\nbased on the Basel III\ncapital standards\nestablished by the\nBasel Committee on\nBanking Supervision\n(\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nincluding well-\ncapitalized standards,\nfor large BHCs and\nevaluates our\ncompliance with such\nrequirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar\ncapital requirements\nand standards for\nMorgan Stanley Bank,\nN.A. (\u201cMSBNA\u201d), Morg\nan Stanley Private\nBank, National\nAssociation\n(\u201cMSPBNA\u201d), E*TRADE\nBank (\u201cETB\u201d) and\nE*TRADE Savings Bank\n(\u201cETSB\u201d), a wholly\nowned subsidiary of\nETB (collectively, our\n\u201cU.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries\u201d). On\nJanuary 1, 2022, ETSB\nmerged with and into\nETB, and subsequently\nETB merged with and\ninto MSPBNA, with\nMSPBNA as the\nsurviving bank.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas published a\ncomprehe nsive set of\nrevisions to its Basel\nIII Framework. The\nimpact on us of any\nrevisions to the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s capital\nstandards is uncertain\nand depends on future\nrulemakings by the\nU.S. banking agencies.\n\nIn addition, many of\nour regulated\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding regulated\nsubsidiaries\nprovisionally\nregistered as swap\ndealers with the\n                                \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    2  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nCFTC or conditionally\nregistered as\nsecurity-based swap\ndealers with the SEC\nor registered as\nbroker-dealers or\nfutures commission\nmerchants.\n\nFor more information\nabout the specific\ncapital requirements\napplicable to us and\nour U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries, as well\nas our subsidiaries\nthat are swap dealers\nand security-based\nswap dealers, see\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u201d and Note\n17 to the financial\nstatements.\n\nCapital Planning,\nStress Tests and\nCapital Distributions.\nThe Federal Reserve\nhas adopted capital\nplanning and stress\ntest requirements for\nlarge BHCs, including\nMorgan Stanley.

In\naddition to capital\nregulations, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have\nadopted liquidity and\nfunding standards,\nincluding the LCR, the\nNSFR, liquidity stress\ntesting and associated\nliquidity reserve\nrequirements.\n\nFor more information,\nsee \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Balance\nSheet\u2014Regulatory\nLiquidity Framework.\u201d\n\nSystemic Risk Regime.\nUnder rules issued by\nthe Federal Reserve,\nlarge BHCs, including\nMorgan Stanley, must\nconduct internal\nliquidity stress\ntests, maintain\nunencumbered highly\nliquid assets to meet\nprojected net cash\noutflows for 30 days\nover the range of\nliquidity stress\nscenarios used in\ninternal stress tests,\nand comply with\nvarious liquidity risk\nmanagement\nrequirements. These\nlarge BHCs also must\ncomply with a range of\nrisk management and\ncorporate governance\nrequirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nalso imposes single-\ncounterparty credit\nlimits (\u201cSCCL\u201d) for\nlarge banking\norganizations. U.S.\nG-SIBs, including us,\nare subject to a limit\nof 15% of Tier 1\ncapital for aggregate\nnet credit exposures\nto any \u201cmajor\ncounterparty\u201d (defined\nto include other U.S.\nG-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs\nand non-bank\nsystemically important\nfinancial institutions\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve). In\naddition, we are\nsubject to a limit of\n25% of Tier 1 capital\nfor aggregate net\ncredit exposures to\nany other unaffiliated\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nhas proposed rules\nthat would create a\nnew early remediation\nframework to address\nfinancial distress or\nmaterial management\nweaknesses. The\nFederal Reserve also\nhas the ability to\nestablish additional\nprudential standards,\nincluding those\nregarding contingent\ncapital, enhanced\npublic disclosures and\nlimits on short-term\ndebt, including off-\nbalance sheet\nexposures.

We\nare required to submit\nonce every two years\nto the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC a\nresolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy\nfor a rapid and\norderly resolution\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the\nevent of our material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. Interim\nupdates are required\nin certain limited\ncircumstances,\nincluding material\nmergers or\nacquisitions or\nfundamental changes to\nour resolution\nstrategy.\n\nOur preferred\nresolution strategy,\nwhich is set out in\nour most recent\nresolution plan, is an\nSPOE strategy, which\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy after the\nParent Company has\nfiled for bankruptcy.\n\nOur next resolution\nplan is due July 1,\n2023. Further, we\nsubmit an annual\nrecovery plan to the\nFederal Reserve that\noutlines the steps\nthat management could\ntake over time to\ngenerate or conserve\nfinancial resources in\ntimes of prolonged\nfinancial stress.\n\nCertain of our\ndomestic and foreign\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution\nand recovery planning\nrequirements in the\njurisdictions in which\nthey operate. For\nexample, the FDIC\ncurrently requires\ncertain insured\ndepository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding MSBNA and\nMSPBNA, to submit a\n                                \n  3    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nresolution plan every\nthree years, that\ndescribes the IDI\u2019s\nstrategy for a rapid\nand orderly resolution\nin the event of\nmaterial financial\ndistress or failure of\nthe IDI.\n\nIn addition, certain\nfinancial companies,\nincluding BHCs such as\nthe Firm and certain\nof its subsidiaries,\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nwith the FDIC being\nappointed as receiver,\nprovided that\ndetermination of\nextraordinary\nfinancial distress and\nsystemic risk is made\nby the U.S. Treasury\nSecretary in\nconsultation with the\nU.S. President.\nRegulators have\nadopted certain\norderly liquidation\nauthority implementing\nregulations and may\nexpand or clarify\nthese regulations in\nthe future. If we were\nsubject to the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nthe FDIC would have\nconsiderable powers,\nincluding: the power\nto remove directors\nand officers\nresponsible for our\nfailure and to appoint\nnew directors and\nofficers; the power to\nassign our assets and\nliabilities to a third\nparty or bridge\nfinancial company\nwithout the need for\ncreditor consent or\nprior court review;\nthe ability to\ndifferentiate among\nour creditors,\nincluding treating\ncertain creditors\nwithin the same class\nbetter than others,\nsubject to a minimum\nrecovery right on the\npart of disfavored\ncreditors to receive\nat least what they\nwould have received in\nbankruptcy\nliquidation; and broad\npowers to administer\nthe claims process to\ndetermine\ndistributions from the\nassets of the\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas been developing an\nSPOE strategy that\ncould be used to\nimplement the orderly\nliquidation authority.\n\nRegulators have also\ntaken and proposed\nvarious actions to\nfacilitate an SPOE\nstrategy under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nor other resolution\nregimes.\n\nFor more information\nabout our resolution\nplan-related\nsubmissions and\nassociated regulatory\nactions, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk,\u201d\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Total\nLoss-Absorbing\nCapacity, Long-Term\nDebt and Clean Holding\nCompany Requirements\u201d\nand \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory R\nequirements\u2014Resolution\nand Recovery\nPlanning.\u201d\n\nCyber and Information\nSecurity Risk\nManagement and\nProtection of Client\nInformation\n\nThe financial services\nindustry faces\nincreased global\nregulatory focus\nregarding cyber and\ninformation security\nrisk management\npractices. Many\naspects of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto cybersecurity legal\nand regulatory\nrequirements enacted\nby U.S. federal and\nstate governments and\nother non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These\nlaws are generally\naimed at codifying\nbasic cybersecurity\nprotections and\nmandating data breach\nnotification\nrequirements.\n\nOur businesses are\nalso subject to\nincreasing privacy and\ndata protection legal\nrequirements\nconcerning the use and\n\nprotection of certain\npersonal information.\nThese requirements\nimpose mandatory\nprivacy and data\nprotection\nobligations, including\nproviding for\nindividual rights,\nenhanced governance\nand accountability\nrequirements, and\nsignificant fines and\nlitigation risk for\nnoncompliance. In\naddition, several\njurisdictions have\nenacted or proposed\npersonal data\nlocalization\nrequirements and\nrestrictions on cross-\nborder transfer of\npersonal data that may\nrestrict our ability\nto conduct business in\nthose jurisdictions or\ncreate additional\nfinancial and\nregulatory burdens to\ndo so.\n\nMany aspects of our\nbusinesses are subject\nto legal requirements\nconcerning the use and\nprotection of certain\ncustomer information,\nas well as the privacy\nand cybersecurity laws\nreferenced above. We\nhave adopted measures\ndesigned to comply\nwith these and related\napplicable\nrequirements in all\nrelevant\njurisdictions.\n                                              \n  U.S. Bank Subsidiaries                      \n                                              \nThe U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries are FDIC-\ninsured depository\ninstitutions subject\nto supervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the OCC\nand are subject to the\nOCC\u2019s risk governance\nguidelines, which\nestablish heightened\nstandards for a large\nIDI\u2019s risk governance\nframework and the\noversight of that\nframework by the IDI\u2019s\nboard of directors.\nThe U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries are also\nsubject to prompt\ncorrective action\nstandards, which\nrequire the relevant\nfederal banking\nregulator to take\nprompt corrective\naction with respect to\na depository\ninstitution if that\ninstitution does not\nmeet certain capital\nadequacy standards. In\naddition, BHCs, such\nas Morgan Stanley, are\nrequired to serve as a\nsource of strength to\ntheir U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries and\ncommit resources to\nsupport these\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent such\nsubsidiaries are in\nfinancial distress.\n\nOur U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries are also\nsubject to Sections\n23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act,\nwhich impose\nrestrictions on\ncertain transactions\nwith affiliates,\nincluding any\nextension of credit\nto, or purchase of\nassets from an\naffiliate.

The\ngrowth in economic\nactivity and demand\nfor goods and\nservices, alongside\nlabor shortages and\nsupply chain\ncomplications, has\nalso contributed to\nrising inflationary\npressures. Should\nthese ongoing effects\nof the pandemic\ncontinue for an\nextended period or\nworsen, we could\nexperience reduced\nclient activity and\ndemand for our\nproducts and services.\n\nThe Firm continues to\nbe fully operational\nand, recognizing that\nlocal conditions vary\nfor our offices around\nthe world and that the\ntrajectory of the\nvirus continues to be\nuncertain, our\nemployees are able to\nwork from home and in\nour offices as deemed\nnecessary . If\nsignificant portions\nof our workforce,\nincluding key\npersonnel, are unable\nto work effectively\nbecause of illness,\ngovernment actions, or\nother restrictions in\nconnection with the\npandemic, the impact\nof the pandemic on our\nbusinesses could be\nexacerbated.\n\nThe extent to which\nthe consequences of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\naffect our businesses,\nresults of operations\nand financial\ncondition, as well as\nour regulatory capital\nand liquidity ratios\nand our ability to\ntake capital actions,\nwill depend on future\ndevelopments that\nremain uncertain,\nincluding the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of\nvaccines globally, the\nseverity and duration\nof any resurgence of\nCOVID-19 variants,\nfuture actions taken\nby governmental\nauthorities, central\nbanks and other third\nparties in response to\nthe pandemic, and the\neffects on o ur\ncustomers,\ncounterparties,\nemployees and third-\nparty service\nproviders.

These\nfluctuations impact\nresults by causing\nvariations in business\nflows and activity and\nin the fair value of\nsecurities and other\nfinancial products.\nFluctuations also\noccur due to the level\nof global market\nactivity, which, among\nother things, affects\nthe size, number and\ntiming of investment\nbanking client\nassignments and\ntransactions and the\nrealization of returns\nfrom our principal\ninvestments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable\nmarket or economic\nconditions may have\nadverse impacts on the\nlevel of individual\ninvestor participation\nin the global markets\nand/or the level of\nclient assets, and, in\nvery low interest rate\nenvironments, the\nlevel of net interest\nincome, which would\nnegatively impact the\nresults of our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nSubstantial market\nfluctuations could\nalso cause variations\nin the value of our\ninvestments in our\nfunds, the flow of\ninvestment capital\ninto or from AUM, and\nthe way customers\nallocate capital among\nmoney market, equity,\nfixed income or other\ninvestment\nalternatives, which\ncould negatively\nimpact our Investment\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nThe value of our\nfinancial instruments\nmay be materially\naffected by market\nfluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and\ndisruptions in the\ncredit markets may\nmake it extremely\ndifficult to value and\nmonetize certain of\nour financial\ninstruments,\nparticularly during\nperiods of market\ndisplacement.\nSubsequent valuations\nin future periods, in\nlight of factors then\nprevailing, may result\nin significant changes\nin the value of these\ninstruments and may\nadversely impact\nhistorical or\nprospective fees and\nperformance-based\nincome (also known as\nincentive fees, which\ninclude carried\ninterest) in respect\nof certain businesses.\nIn addition, at the\n                                \n  9    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \ntime of any sales and\nsettlements of these\nfinancial instruments,\nthe price we\nultimately realize\nwill depend on the\ndemand and liquidity\nin the market at that\ntime and may be\nmaterially lower than\ntheir current fair\nvalue. Any of these\nfactors could cause a\ndecline in the value\nof our financial\ninstruments, which may\nhave an adverse effect\non our results of\noperations in future\nperiods.\n\nIn addition, financial\nmarkets are\nsusceptible to severe\nevents evidenced by\nrapid depreciation in\nasset values\naccompanied by a\nreduction in asset\nliquidity. Under these\nextreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be as\neffective at\nmitigating trading\nlosses as they would\nbe under more normal\nmarket conditions.\nMoreover, under these\nconditions, market\nparticipants are\nparticularly exposed\nto trading strategies\nemployed by many\nmarket participants\nsimultaneously and on\na large scale. Our\nrisk management and\nmonitoring processes\nseek to quantify and\nmitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves.\nHowever, severe market\nevents have\nhistorically been\ndifficult to predict,\nand we could realize\nsignificant losses if\nextreme market events\nwere to occur.\n\nHolding large and\nconcentrated positions\nmay expose us to\nlosses.\n\nConcentration of risk\nmay reduce revenues or\nresult in losses in\nour market-making,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting\n(including block\ntrading), and lending\nbusinesses (including\nmargin lending) in the\nevent of unfavorable\nmarket movements or\nwhen market conditions\nare more favorable for\nour competitors.

This risk may\narise from a variety\nof business\nactivities, including,\nbut not limited to:\nextending credit to\nclients through\nvarious lending\ncommitments; entering\ninto swap or other\nderivative contracts\nunder which\ncounterparties have\nobligations to make\npayments to us;\nproviding short- or\nlong-term funding that\nis secured by physical\nor financial\ncollateral whose value\nmay at times be\ninsufficient to fully\ncover the loan\nrepayment\n\namount; posting margin\nand/or collateral and\nother commitments to\nclearing houses,\nclearing agencies,\nexchanges, banks,\nsecurities firms and\nother financial\ncounterparties; and\ninvesting and trading\nin securities and loan\npools, whereby the\nvalue of these assets\nmay fluctuate based on\nrealized or expected\ndefaults on the\nunderlying obligations\nor loans.\n\nWe also incur credit\nrisk in our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment lending to\nmainly individual\ninvestors, including,\nbut not limited to,\nmargin- and\nsecurities-based loans\ncollateralized by\nsecurities,\nresidential mortgage\nloans and HELOCs.\n\nOur valuations related\nto, and reserves for\nlosses on, credit\nexposures rely on\ncomplex models,\nestimates, and\nsubjective judgments\nabout the future.\nWhile we believe\ncurrent valuations and\nreserves adequately\naddress our perceived\nlevels of risk, future\neconomic conditions\nthat differ from or\nare more severe than\nforecast, inaccurate\nmodels or assumptions,\nor external factors\nsuch as natural\ndisasters,\ngeopolitical events or\nthe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic, could lead\nto inaccurate\nmeasurement of or\ndeterioration of\ncredit quality of our\nborrowers and\ncounterparties or the\nvalue of collateral\nand result in\nunexpected losses. We\nmay also incur higher\nthan anti cipated\ncredit losses as a\nresult of (i) disputes\nwith counterparties\nover the valuation of\ncollateral or (ii)\nactions taken by other\nlenders that may\nnegatively impact the\nvaluation of\ncollateral.

In\naddition, in the\nlonger term, climate\nchange may have a\nnegati ve impact on\nthe financial\ncondition of our\nclients, which may\ndecrease revenues from\nthose clients and\nincrease the credit\nrisk associated with\nloans and other credit\nexposures to those\nclients.\n\nCertain of our credit\nexposures may be\nconcentrated by\ncounterparty, product,\nindustry or country.\nAlthough our models\nand estimates account\nfor correlations among\nrelated types of\nexposures, a change in\nthe market environment\nfor a concentrated\nproduct or an external\nfactor impacting a\nconcentrated\ncounterparty, industry\nor country may result\nin credit losses in\nexcess of amounts\nforecast.\nConcentrations of\ncredit risk are\nmanaged through the\nFirm\u2019s comprehensive\nand global Credit\nLimits Framework.\n\nIn addition, as a\nclearing member of\nseveral central\ncounterparties, we are\nresponsible for the\ndefaults or misconduct\nof our customers and\ncould incur financial\nlosses in the event of\ndefault by other\nclearing members.\nAlthough we regularly\nreview our credit\nexposures, default\nrisk may arise from\nevents or\ncircumstances that are\ndifficult to detect or\nforesee.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    10  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nA default by a large\nfinancial institution\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial markets.\n\nThe commercial\nsoundness of many\nfinancial institutions\nmay be closely\ninterrelated as a\nresult of credit,\ntrading, clearing or\nother relationships\namong the\ninstitutions.\nIncreased\ncentralization of\ntrading activities\nthrough particular\nclearing houses,\ncentral agents or\nexchanges as required\nby provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act may\nincrease our\nconcentration of risk\nwith respect to these\nentities.

Furthermore,\nthe concentration of\ncompany and personal\ninformation held by a\nhandful of third\nparties increases the\nrisk that a breach at\na key third party may\ncause an industry-wide\nevent that could\nsignificantly increase\nthe cost and risk of\nconducting business.\n\nThere can be no\nassurance that our\nbusiness contingency\nand security response\nplans fully mitigate\nall potential risks to\nus.

Human\nerrors and\nmalfeasance, even if\npromptly discovered\nand remediated, can\nresult in material\nlosses and liabilities\nfor us.\n\nWe conduct business in\nvarious jurisdictions\noutside the U.S.,\nincluding\njurisdictions that may\nnot have comparable\nlevels of protection\nfor their corporate\nassets such as\nintellectual property,\ntrademarks, trade\nsecrets, know-how, and\ncustomer information\nand records. The\nprotection afforded in\nthose jurisdictions\nmay be less\nestablished and/or\npredictable than in\nthe U.S. or other\njurisdictions in which\nwe operate.

If the\nFederal Reserve and\nthe FDIC were to\njointly determine that\nour resolution plan\nsubmission was not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution, and if we\nwere unable to address\nany deficiencies\nidentified by the\nregulators, we or any\nof our subsidiaries\nmay be subject to more\nstringent capital,\nleverage, or liquidity\nrequirements or\nrestrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or\noperations, or after a\ntwo-year period, we\nmay be required to\ndivest assets or\noperations.\n\nIn addition, provided\nthat certain\nprocedures are met, we\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority\nunder Title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act with\nthe FDIC being\nappointed as receiver.\nThe FDIC\u2019s power under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nto disregard the\npriority of creditor\nclaims and treat\nsimilarly situated\ncreditors differently\nin certain\ncircumstances, subject\nto certain\nlimitations, could\nadversely impact\nholders of our\nunsecured debt.

The\nParent Company has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to the\nFunding IHC. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nmaterial assets that\ncan be contributed\nunder the terms of the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement\n(other than shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets)\n(\u201cContributable\nAssets\u201d), to the\nFunding IHC. The\nFunding IHC would be\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our\nmaterial entities.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and of\nthe Funding IHC,\nrespectively, under\nthe amended and\nrestated support\nagreement are in most\ncases secured on a\nsenior basis by the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany (other than\nshares in subsidiaries\nof the Parent Company\nand certain other\nassets), and the\nassets of the Funding\nIHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of\nour material entities,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, against the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany with respect\nto such secured assets\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE\nstrategy, whether\napplied pursuant to\nour resolution plan or\nin a resolution\nproceeding under the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, is intended\nto result in better\noutcomes for creditors\noverall, there is no\nguarantee that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy, including\nthe provision of\nsupport to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s material\nentities pursuant to\nthe secured amended\nand restated support\nagreement, will not\nresult in greater\nlosses for holders of\nour securities\ncompared with a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy for us.\n\nRegulators have taken\nand proposed various\nactions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, the orderly\nliquidation authority\nand other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequires top-tier BHCs\nof U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to\nmaintain minimum\namounts of equity and\neligible long-term\ndebt TLAC in order to\nensure that such\ninstitutions have\nenough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point\nof failure to be\nrecapitalized through\nthe conversion of debt\nto equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on\neligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is\nused. The combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the TLAC\nrequirement is that\nour losses will be\nimposed on the holders\nof eligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\nthe creditors of our\nmaterial entities\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nother E.U.\njurisdictions, have\nimplemented, or are in\nthe process of\nimplementing, changes\nto resolution regimes\nto provide resolution\nauthorities with the\nability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity organized in\nsuch jurisdiction by\nwriting down certain\nunsecured liabilities\nor converting certain\nunsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers are\nintended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\n                                 \n  15    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nits shareholders and\nunsecured creditors.\nNon-U.S. regulators\nare also considering\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\nTLAC that would pass\nlosses up from the\nsubsidiaries to the\nParent Company and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe Parent Company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented\nfrom paying dividends\nor taking other\ncapital actions\nbecause of regulatory\nconstraints or revised\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve,\nincluding with respect\nto regulatory capital\nrequirements, stress\ntesting and capital\nplanning. We submit,\non at least an annual\nbasis, a capital plan\nto the Federal Reserve\ndescribing proposed\ndividend payments to\nshareholders, proposed\nrepurchases of our\noutstanding securities\nand other proposed\ncapital actions that\nwe intend to take.

As\na result of this\ncompensation, it is\npossible we could face\nan increased number of\ninvestigations by the\nSEC or CFTC.\n\nWe have been named,\nfrom time to time, as\na defendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, as well as\ninvestigations or\nproceedings brought by\nregulatory agencies,\narising in connection\nwith our activities as\na global diversified\nfinancial services\ninstitution.

Moreover,\nwe utilize multiple\nbrands and business\nchannels, including\nthose resulting from\nour acquisitions, and\ncontinue to enhance\nthe collaboration\nacross business\nsegments, which may\nheighten the potential\nconflicts of interest\nor the risk of\nimproper sharing of\ninformation.\n\nWe have policies,\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest,\nand we utilize various\nmeasures, such as the\nuse of disclosure, to\nmanage these potential\nconflicts. However,\nidentifying and\nmitigating potential\nconflicts of interest\ncan be complex and\nchallenging and can\nbecome the focus of\nmedia and regulatory\nscrutiny. Indeed,\nactions that merely\nappear to create a\nconflict can put our\nreputation at risk\neven if the likelihood\nof an actual conflict\nhas been mitigated. It\nis possible that\npotential conflicts\ncould give rise to\nlitigation or\nenforcement actions,\nwhich may lead to our\nclients being less\nwilling to enter into\ntransactions in which\na conflict may occur\nand could adversely\naffect our businesses\nand reputation.\n\nOur regulators have\nthe ability to\nscrutinize our\nactivities for\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nthrough detailed\nexaminations of\nspecific transactions.\nFor example, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve\nsubjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve\nscrutiny with respect\nto transactions\nbetween our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates. Further,\nthe Volcker Rule\nsubjects us to\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding certain\ntransactions between\nus and our clients.\n                                              \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nOur risk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposures in all\nmarket environments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, which could\nresult in unexpected\nlosses.\n\nWe have devoted\nsignificant resources\nto develop our risk\nmanagement\ncapabilities and\nexpect to continue to\ndo so in the future.\nNonetheless, our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nmodels and processes,\nincluding our use of\nvarious risk models\nfor assessing market\nexposures and hedging\nstrategies, stress\ntesting and other\nanalysis, may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposure in all market\nenvironments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, including risks\nthat are unidentified\nor unanticipated.\n\nAs our businesses\nchange and grow, and\nthe markets in which\nwe operate evolve, our\nrisk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not\nalways adapt with\nthose changes. Some of\nour methods of\nmanaging risk are\nbased upon our use of\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\nAs a result, these\nmethods may not\npredict future risk\nexposures, which could\nbe significantly\ngreater than the\nhistorical measures\nindicate.\n\nIn addition, many\nmodels we use are\nbased on assumptions\nor inputs regarding\ncorrelations among\nprices of various\nasset classes or other\nmarket indicators and,\ntherefore, cannot\nanticipate sudden,\nunanticipated, or\nunidentified market or\neconomic movements,\nsuch as the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich could cause us\nto incur losses.\n\nManagement of market,\ncredit, liquidity,\noperational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and\ncompliance risks\nrequires, among other\nthings, policies and\nprocedures to record\nproperly and verify a\nlarge number of\ntransactions and\nevents, and these\npolicies and\nprocedures may not be\nfully effective. Our\ntrading risk\nmanagement strategies\nand techniques also\nseek to balance our\nability to profit from\ntrading positions with\nour exposure to\npotential losses.\n\nWhile we employ a\nbroad and diversified\nset of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the timing\nof such outcomes. For\nexample, to the extent\nthat our trading or\ninvesting activities\ninvolve less liquid\ntrading markets or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sales\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and,\ntherefore, reduce our\nrisk associated with\nsuch positions. We\nmay, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course\nof our trading or\ninvesting activities.\nFor more information\non how we monitor and\nmanage market and\ncertain other risks\nand related\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Market Risk.\u201d\n\nClimate change\nmanifesting as\nphysical or transition\nrisks could adversely\naffect our operations,\nbusinesses and\nclients.\n\nThere is increasing\nconcern over the risks\nof climate change and\nrelated environmental\nsustainability\nmatters. The physical\nrisks of climate\nchange include acute\nevents, such as\nflooding, extreme heat\nand wildfires, and\nchronic, longer-term\nshifts in climate\npatterns, such as\nincreasing\ntemperatures, sea\nlevel rise, and more\nfrequent and prolonged\ndrought. Such events\ncould disrupt our\noperations or those of\nour clients or third\nparties on which we\nrely, including\nthrough direct damage\nto physical assets and\nindirect impacts from\nsupply chain\ndisruption and market\nvolatility.\n\nAdditionally,\ntransitioning to a\nlow-carbon economy\nwill likely require\nextensive policy,\nlegal, technology and\nmarket changes.\nTransition risks,\nincluding changes in\nconsumer preferences\nand additional\nregulatory and\nlegislative\n                                 \n  17    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nrequirements,\nincluding carbon\ntaxes, could increase\nour expenses and\nadversely impact our\nstrategies and those\nof our clients.\n\nIn addition, our\nreputation and client\nrelationships may be\nadversely impacted as\na result of our\npractices related to\nclimate change,\nincluding our\ninvolvement, or our\nclients\u2019 involvement,\nin certain industries,\nprojects, or\ninitiatives associated\nwith causing, or\npotentially slowing\nsolutions to, climate\nchange, as well as any\ndecisions we make to\ncontinue to conduct or\nchange our activities\nin response to\nconsiderations\nrelating to climate\nchange.\n\nAs climate risk is\ninterconnected with\nother risk types,\nincluding geopolitical\nrisks, we have\ndeveloped and continue\nto enhance processes\nto embed climate risk\nconsiderations into\nour risk management\nstrategies, as well as\ngovernance structures,\nestablished for risks\nsuch as market, credit\nand operational risks.\nBecause the timing and\nseverity of climate\nchange events or\nsocietal changes in\nreaction to them may\nbe difficult to\npredict, our risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be effective\nin mitigating climate\nrisk exposure.\n\nIn addition, the\nmethodology and data\nused to manage and\nmonitor climate risk\ncontinues to evolve\nand currently utilizes\ninformation and\nestimates that have\nbeen derived from\ninformation or factors\nreleased by third-\nparty sources, which\nmay not be current.\nCertain third-party\ninformation may also\nchange over time as\nmethodologies evolve\nand are refined. While\nwe believe this\ninformation is\nreasonable at the\ntime, we may only be\nable to complete\nlimited validation.\nThese and other\nfactors could cause\nresults to differ\nmaterially from those\nexpressed in the\nestimates and beliefs\nmade by third parties\nand by us, which could\nalso impact our\nmanagement of risk in\nthis area.\n\nReplacement of London\nInterbank Offered Rate\nand replacement or\nreform of other\ninterest rate\nbenchmarks could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations.\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave commissioned\ncommittees and working\ngroups of market\nparticipants and\nofficial sector\nrepresentatives to\nreplace LIBOR and\nreplace or reform\nother interest rate\nbenchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from the use of\nthe IBORs to\nalternative rates and\nother potential\ninterest rate\nbenchmark reforms is\nunderway and will\ncontinue o ver the\ncourse of the next few\nyears. These reforms\nhave caused and may in\nthe future cause such\nrates to perform\ndifferently than in\nthe past, or to cease\nentirely, or have\nother consequences\nthat are contrary to\nmarket expectations.\n\nThe ongoing market\ntransition away from\nIBORs and other\ninterest rate\nbenchmarks to\nalternative reference\nrates is complex and\ncould have a range of\nadverse impacts on our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations. In\nparticular, such\ntransition or reform\ncould:\n\n\u2022 Adversely impact the\npricing, liquidity,\nvalue of, return on\nand trading for a\nbroad array of\nfinancial products,\nincluding any IBOR-\nlinked securities,\nloans and derivatives\nthat are included in\nour financial assets\nand liabilities;\n\n\u2022 Require further\nextensive changes to\ndocumentation that\ngoverns or references\nIBOR or IBOR-based\nproducts, including,\nfor example, pursuant\nto time-consuming\nrenegotiations of\nexisting documentation\nto modify the terms of\noutstanding securities\nand related hedging\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 Result in a\npopulation of products\nwith documentation\nthat governs or\nreferences IBOR or\nIBOR-based products\nbut that cannot be\namended due to an\ninability to obtain\nsufficient consent\nfrom counterparties or\nproduct owners;\n\n\u2022 Result in inquiries,\nreviews or other\nactions from\nregulators in respect\nof our (or the\nmarket\u2019s) preparation,\nreadiness, transition\nplans and actions\nregarding the\nreplacement of an IBOR\nwith one or more\nalternative reference\nrates, including\nregulatory guidance\nregarding constraints\non the entry into new\nU.S. dollar IBOR-\nlinked contracts after\nDecember 31, 2021;\n\n\u2022 Result in disputes,\nlitigation or other\nactions with clients,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors in various\nscenarios, such as\nregarding the\ninterpretation and\nenforceability of\nprovisions in IBOR-\nbased products such as\nfallback language or\nother related\nprovisions, including\nin the case of\nfallbacks to the\nalternative reference\nrates, any economic,\nlegal, operational or\nother impact resulting\nfrom the fundamental\ndifferences between\nthe IBORs and the\nvarious alternative\nreference rates;\n\n\u2022 Require the\nadditional transition\nand/or further\ndevelopment of\nappropriate systems\nand analytics to\neffectively transition\nour risk management\nprocesses from IBORs\nto those based on one\nor more alternative\nreference rates in a\ntimely manner,\nincluding by\nquantifying value and\nrisk for various\nalternative reference\nrates, which may prove\nchallenging given the\nlimited history of the\nproposed alternative\nreference rates; and\n\n\u2022 Cause us to incur\nadditional costs in\nrelation to any of the\nabove factors.\n\nOther factors include\nthe pace of the\ntransition to the\nalternative reference\nrates, timing\nmismatches between\ncash and derivative\nmarkets, the specific\nterms and parameters\nfor and market\nacceptance of any\nalternative reference\nrate, market\nconventions for the\nuse of any alternative\nreference rate in\nconnection with a\nparticular product\n(including the timing\nand market adoption of\nany conventions\nproposed or\nrecommended by any\nindustry or other\ngroup), prices of and\nthe liquidity of\ntrading markets for\nproducts based on\nalternative reference\nrates, and our ability\nto further transition\nand develop\nappropriate systems\nand analytics for one\nor more alternative\nreference rates.\n\nSee also \u201cManagement's\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Regulatory \nRequirements\u2014Regulator\ny Developments and\nOther Matters\u201d herein.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    18  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Competitive Environment                     \n                                              \nWe face strong\ncompetition from\nfinancial services\nfirms and others,\nwhich could lead to\npricing pressures that\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nrevenues and\nprofitability.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry and all\naspects of our\nbusinesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so.

We also\ncompete with companies\nthat provide online\ntrading and banking\nservices, investment\nadvisor services,\nrobo-advice\ncapabilities, access\nto digital asset\ncapabilities and\nservices, and other\nfinancial products and\nservices. We compete\non the basis of\nseveral factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, capital or\naccess to capital,\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\ntechnology,\nreputation, risk\nappetite and price.\n\nOver time, certain\nsectors of the\nfinancial services\nindustry have become\nmore concentrated, as\ninstitutions involved\nin a broad range of\nfinancial services\nhave left businesses,\nbeen acquired by or\nmerged into other\nfirms, or have\ndeclared bankruptcy.\nSuch changes could\nresult in our\nremaining competitors\ngaining greater\ncapital and other\nresources, such as the\nability to offer a\nbroader range of\nproducts and services\nand geographic\ndiversity, or new\ncompetitors may\nemerge.\n\nWe have experienced\nand may continue to\nexperience pricing\npressures as a result\nof these factors and\nas some of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nreducing prices,\neliminating\ncommissions or other\nfees, or providing\nmore favorable terms\nof business. In\naddition, certain of\nour competitors may be\nsubject to different\nand, in some cases,\nless stringent, legal\nand regulatory regimes\nthan we are, thereby\nputting us at a\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage. Some new\ncompetitors in the\nfinancial technology\nsector have sought to\ntarget existing\nsegments of our\nbusinesses that could\nbe susceptible to\ndisruption by\ninnovative or less\nregulated business\nmodels.

For additional information on\nthe acquisition of Eaton Vance, see Note 3 to\nthe financial statements.\n\nNet Revenues Asset Management and Related Fees\nAsset management and related fees of $5,576\nmillion in 2021 increased 85% compared with\nthe prior year, primarily due to incremental\nrevenues as a result of the Eaton Vance\nacquisition and higher average AUM driven by\nstrong investment performance and positive net\nflows. See \u201cAssets under Management or\nSupervision\u201d herein. Performance-based Income\nand Other Performance-based income and other\nrevenues of $644 million in 2021 decreased 11%\ncompared with the prior year, primarily due to\nthe reversal of accrued carried interest and\ninvestment losses compared with gains in the\nprior year, in an Asia private equity fund, as\nwell as lower gains on investments associated\nwith certain employee deferred compensation\nplans. These decreases were partially offset\nby higher accrued carried interest, as well as\ninvestment gains in 2021 in other private\ncredit and equity, real estate and\ninfrastructure funds. Non-interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses of $4,542 million in\n2021 increased 59% compared with the prior\nyear as a result of higher Non-compensation\nexpenses and higher Compensation and benefits.\n\u2022 Compensation and benefits expenses increased\nprimarily due to incremental compensation as a\nresult of the Eaton Vance acquisition and\nhigher compensation associated with carried\ninterest, partially offset by lower expenses\nrelated to certain deferred compensation plans\nlinked to investment performance. \u2022 Non-\ncompensation expenses increased primarily due\nto incremental expenses as a result of the\nEaton Vance acquisition.\n                                 \n  35    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nAssets under\nManagement or\nSupervision\nRollforwards\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n1.

The\npayment of those fees to the distributor is\nincluded in Non-compensation expenses in the\nincome statement. Certain Eaton Vance products\nmay have higher or lower average fee rates\nthan similar products prior to the\nacquisition, with the overall impact yielding\na lower average fee rate; however, Asset\nmanagement and related fees arising from the\nacquisition are incremental to our revenues.\n\n\u2022 Inflows \u2014represent investments or\ncommitments from new and existing clients in\nnew or existing investment products, including\nreinvestments of client dividends and\nincreases in invested capital.

This excludes\nany funds where market impact does not impact\nmanagement fees. \u2022 Other \u2014contains both\ndistributions and foreign currency impact for\nall periods.

Employees\nare permitted to\nallocate the value of\ntheir deferred awards\namong a menu of\nnotional investments,\nwhereby the value of\ntheir awards will\ntrack the performance\nof the referenced\nnotional investments.\nThe menu of\ninvestments, which is\nselected by the Firm,\nincludes fixed income,\nequity, commodity and\nmoney market funds.\nCompensation expense\nfor deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nawards is calculated\nbased on the notional\nvalue of the award\ngranted, adjusted for\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of the\nreferenced investments\nthat employees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards. The Firm\ninvests directly, as a\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of its\nobligations under\nthese deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nplans. Changes in the\nvalue of such\ninvestments are\nrecorded in Trading\nand Investments\nrevenues. Although\nchanges in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nmade by the Firm,\nthere is typically a\ntiming difference\nbetween the immediate\nrecognition of gains\nand losses on the\nFirm\u2019s investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nis generally not\nmaterial to Income\nfrom continuing\noperations before\nincome taxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact Firm\nreported ratios (\ne.g., the Expense\nefficiency ratio) in\ncertain periods. At\nDecember 31, 2021,\nsubstantially all\nemployee notional\ninvestments that\nsubjected the Firm to\nprice risk were\nhedged.

Our projected future\ncompensation obligation and expense for\ndeferred cash-based compensation for\nperformance years 2021 and prior are forward-\nlooking statements subject to uncertainty.\nActual results may be materially affected by\nvarious factors, including, among other\nthings: the performance of each participant\u2019s\nreferenced investments; changes in market\nconditions; participants\u2019 allocation of their\ndeferred awards; and participant cancellations\nor accelerations. See \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for additional\ninformation.

Accounting Development\nUpdates The Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard has issued certain accounting updates,\nwhich we have either determined are not\napplicable or are not expected to have a\nsignificant impact on our financial\nstatements.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies Our financial\nstatements are prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates\nand assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial\nstatements). We believe that of our\nsignificant accounting policies (see Note 2 to\nthe financial statements), the following\npolicies involve a higher degree of judgment\nand complexity. Fair Value Financial\nInstruments Measured at Fair Value A\nsignificant number of our financial\ninstruments are carried at fair value. We make\nestimates regarding the valuation of assets\nand liabilities measured at fair value in\npreparing the financial statements. These\nassets and liabilities include, but are not\nlimited to: \u2022 Trading assets and Trading\nliabilities; \u2022 Investment Securities\u2014AFS; \u2022\nCertain Securities purchased under agreements\nto resell; \u2022 Certain Deposits, primarily\ncertificates of deposit; \u2022 Certain Securities\nsold under agreements to repurchase; \u2022 Certain\nOther secured financings; and \u2022 Certain\nBorrowings. Fair value is defined as the price\nthat would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability ( i.e. , the exit\nprice) in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, we use various\nvaluation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs\nis used in measuring fair value that maximizes\nthe use of observable prices and inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable prices and\ninputs by requiring that the relevant\nobservable inputs be used when available. The\nhierarchy is broken down into three levels,\nwherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in\nactive markets, Level 2 represents valuations\nbased on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive or for which all significant inputs are\nobservable, and Level 3 consists of valuation\ntechniques that incorporate significant\nunobservable inputs and, therefore, require\nthe greatest use of judgment. In periods of\nmarket disruption, the observability of prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many\ninstruments, which could cause an instrument\nto be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or\nfrom Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a\ndownturn in market conditions could lead to\ndeclines in the valuation of many instruments.\nFor further information on the definition of\nfair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and\nrelated valuation techniques, and quantitative\ninformation about and sensitivity of\nsignificant unobservable inputs used in Level\n3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 5\nto the financial statements. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty, concentration risk and\nfunding in order to arrive at fair value.

Goodwill\nimpairment tests are\nperformed at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below our\nbusiness segments.\nGoodwill no longer\nretains its\nassociation with a\nparticular acquisition\nonce it has been\nassigned to a\nreporting unit. As\nsuch, all the\nactivities of a\nreporting unit,\nwhether acquired or\norganically developed,\nare available to\nsupport the value of\nthe goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, we\nhave the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\n\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, we\ncompare the fair value\nof a reporting unit\nwith its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited by the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\n\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunits is derived based\non valuation\ntechniques we believe\nmarket participants\nwould use for each of\nthe reporting units.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue is generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology\nor methodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncertain comparable\ncompanies. At each\nannual goodwill\nimpairment testing\ndate, each of our\nreporting units with\ngoodwill had a fair\nvalue that was\nsubstantially in\nexcess of its carrying\nvalue.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nIntangible assets are\ninitially recorded at\ncost, or in the\nsituation where\nacquired as part of a\nbusiness combination,\nat the fair value\ndetermined as part of\nthe acquisition method\nof accou nting.\nSubsequently,\namortizable intangible\nassets are carried in\nthe balance sheet at\namortized cost, where\namortization is\nrecognized over their\nestimated useful\nlives. Indefinite\nlived intangible\nassets are not\namortized but are\ntested for impairment\non an annual basis as\nof July 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\n\nOn a quarterly basis:\n\n\u2022 All intangible\nassets are assessed\nfor the presence of\nimpairment indicators.\nWhere such indicators\nare present, an\nevaluation for\nimpairment is\nconducted.\n\n\u2022 For amortizable\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment loss exists\nif the carrying amount\nof the intangible\nasset is not\nrecoverable and\nexceeds its fair\nvalue. The carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\nnot recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the\nexpected undiscounted\ncash flows.\n\n\u2022 For indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, an\nimpairment exists if\nthe carrying amount of\nthe intangible asset\nexceeds its fair\nvalue.\n\n\u2022 Amortizable\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nremaining useful life\nor the finite life\nclassification should\nbe revised. In such\ncases, the remaining\ncarrying amount is\namortized\nprospectively over the\nrevised useful life,\nunless it is\ndetermined that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is indefinite,\nin which case the\nintangible asset is\nnot amortized.\n\n\u2022 Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are\nassessed for any\nindication that the\nlife of the intangible\nasset is no longer\nindefinite; in such\ncases, the carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\namortized\nprospectively over its\nremaining useful life.\n\nThe initial valuation\nof an intangible asset\nas part of the\nacquisition method of\naccounting and the\nsubsequent valuation\nof intangible assets\nas part of an\nimpairment assessment\nare subjective and\nbased, in part, on\ninputs that are\nunobservable and can\nbe subject to\nuncertainty. These\ninputs include, but\nare not limited to,\nforecasted cash flows,\nrevenue growth rates,\ncustomer attrition\nrates and discount\nrates.\n\nFor both goodwill and\nintangible assets, to\nthe extent an\nimpairment loss is\nrecognized, the loss\nestablishes the new\ncost basis of the\nasset. Subsequent\nreversal of impairment\nlosses is not\npermitted. For\namortizable intangible\nassets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized\nover the remaining\nuseful life of that\nasset. Adverse market\nor economic events\ncould result in\nimpairment charges in\nfuture periods.\n\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 11\nto the financial\nstatements for\nadditional information\nabout goodwill and\nintangible assets.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Contingencies          \n                                              \nIn the normal course\nof business, we have\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with our\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\n\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress.\n                                 \n  39    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nWe are also involved,\nfrom time to time, in\nother reviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding our\nbusiness and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales,\nfinancing, prime-\nbrokerage, market-\nmaking activities,\nwealth and investment\nmanagement services,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby us, and accounting\nand operational\nmatters, certain of\nwhich may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions\nor other relief.\n\nAccruals for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nare generally\ndetermined on a case-\nby-case basis. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand we can reasonably\nestimate the amount of\nthat loss, we accrue\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\ndeciding when and if\nto make these\naccruals, and the\nactual cost of a legal\nclaim or regulatory\nfine/penalty may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals.\n\nSee Note 15 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation on legal\ncontingencies.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nWe are subject to the\nincome and indirect\ntax laws of the U.S.,\nits states and\nmunicipalities and\nthose of the foreign\njurisdictions in which\nwe have significant\nbusiness operations.\nThese tax laws are\ncomplex and subject to\ninterpretation by the\ntaxpayer and the\nrelevant governmental\ntaxing authorities. We\nmust make judgments\nand interpretations\nabout the application\nof these inherently\ncomplex tax laws when\ndetermining the\nprovision for income\ntaxes and the expense\nfor indirect taxes and\nmust also make\nestimates about when\n\ncertain items affect\ntaxable income in the\nvarious tax\njurisdictions.\n\nDisputes over\ninterpretations of the\ntax laws may be\nsettled with the\ntaxing authority upon\nexamination or audit.\nWe periodically\nevaluate the\nlikelihood of\nassessments in each\ntaxing jurisdiction\nresulting from current\nand subsequent years\u2019\nexaminations, and\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits related to\npotential losses that\nmay arise from tax\naudits are established\nin accordance with the\nrelevant accounting\nguidance. Once\nestablished,\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits are adjusted\nwhen there is more\ninformation available\nor when an event\noccurs requiring a\nchange.\n\nOur provision for\nincome taxes is\ncomposed of current\nand deferred taxes.\nCurrent income taxes\napproximate taxes to\nbe paid or refunded\nfor the current\nperiod. Deferred\nincome taxes reflect\nthe net tax effects of\ntemporary differences\nbetween the financial\nreporting and tax\nbases of assets and\nliabilities and are\nmeasured using the\napplicable enacted tax\nrates and laws that\nwill be in effect when\nsuch differences are\nexpected to reverse.\n\nOur deferred tax\nbalances may also\ninclude deferred\nassets related to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards, such as\nnet operating losses\nand tax credits that\nwill be realized\nthrough reduction of\nfuture tax liabilities\nand, in some cases,\nare subject to\nexpiration if not\nutilized within\ncertain periods. We\nperform regular\nreviews to ascertain\nwhether deferred tax\nassets are realizable.\nThese reviews include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions\nregarding future\ntaxable income and\nincorporate various\ntax planning\nstrategies, including\nstrategies that may be\navailable to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards before\nthey expire.\n\nOnce the deferred tax\nasset balances have\nbeen determined, we\nmay record a valuation\nallowance against the\ndeferred tax asset\nbalances to reflect\nthe amount we estimate\nis more likely than\nnot to be realized at\na future date. Both\ncurrent and deferred\nincome taxes may\nreflect adjustments\nrelated to our\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\nestimating the\nconsolidated provision\nfor (benefit from)\nincome taxes, current\nand deferred tax\nbalances (including\nvaluation allowance,\nif any), accrued\ninterest or penalties\nand uncertain tax\npositions.

Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework The primary\ngoal of our Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework is to ensure\nthat we have access to\nadequate funding\nacross a wide range of\nmarket conditions and\ntime horizons. The\nframework is designed\nto enable us to\nfulfill our financial\nobligations and\nsupport the execution\nof our business\nstrategies. The\nfollowing principles\nguide our Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework: \u2022\nSufficient Liquidity\nResources should be\nmaintained to cover\nmaturing liabilities\nand other planned and\ncontingent outflows; \u2022\nMaturity profile of\nassets and liabilities\nshould be aligned,\nwith limited reliance\non short-term funding;\n\u2022 Source,\ncounterparty,\ncurrency, region and\nterm of funding should\nbe diversified; and \u2022\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nshould anticipate, and\naccount for, periods\nof limited access to\nfunding. The core\ncomponents of our\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework\nare the Required\nLiquidity Framework,\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nand Liquidity\nResources, which\nsupport our target\nliquidity profile.\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework Our Required\nLiquidity Framework\nestablishes the amount\nof liquidity we must\nhold in both normal\nand stressed\n                                 \n  41    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nenvironments to ensure\nthat our financial\ncondition and overall\nsoundness are not\nadversely affected by\nan inability (or\nperceived inability)\nto meet our financial\nobligations in a\ntimely manner. The\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework considers\nthe most constraining\nliquidity requirement\nto satisfy all\nregulatory and\ninternal limits at a\nconsolidated and legal\nentity level.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nWe use Liquidity\nStress Tests to model\nexternal and\nintercompany liquidity\nflows across multiple\nscenarios and a range\nof time horizons.\nThese scenarios\ncontain various\ncombinations of\nidiosyncratic and\nsystemic stress events\nof different severity\nand duration. The\nmethodology,\nimplementation,\nproduction and\nanalysis of our\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nare important\ncomponents of the\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework. The\nassumptions used in\nour various Liquidity\nStress Test scenarios\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the\nfollowing: \u2022 No\ngovernment support; \u2022\nNo access to equity\nand limited access to\nunsecured debt\nmarkets; \u2022 Repayment\nof all unsecured debt\nmaturing within the\nstress horizon; \u2022\nHigher haircuts for\nand significantly\nlower availability of\nsecured funding; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\nby trading\ncounterparties,\ncertain exchanges and\nclearing organizations\nrelated to credit\nrating downgrades; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\ndue to collateral\nsubstitutions,\ncollateral disputes\nand uncalled\ncollateral; \u2022\nDiscretionary\nunsecured debt\nbuybacks; \u2022 Drawdowns\non lending commitments\nprovided to third\nparties; and \u2022 Client\ncash withdrawals and\nreduction in customer\nshort positions that\nfund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nare produced and\nresults are reported\nat different levels,\nincluding major\noperating subsidiaries\nand major currencies,\nto capture specific\ncash requirements and\ncash availability\nacross the Firm,\nincluding a limited\nnumber of asset sales\nin a stressed\nenvironment. The\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nassume that\nsubsidiaries will use\ntheir own liquidity\nfirst to fund their\nobligations before\ndrawing liquidity from\nthe Parent Company and\nthat the Parent\nCompany will support\nits subsidiaries and\nwill not have access\nto subsidiaries\u2019\nliquidity reserves. In\naddition to the\nassumptions\nunderpinning the\nLiquidity Stress\nTests, we take into\nconsideration\nsettlement risk\nrelated to intraday\nsettlement and\nclearing of securities\nand financing\nactivities. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, we\nmaintained sufficient\nLiquidity Resources to\nmeet current and\ncontingent funding\nobligations as modeled\nin our Liquidity\nStress Tests.\n\nLiquidity Resources We\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity resources,\nwhich consist of HQLA\nand cash deposits with\nbanks (\u201cLiquidity\nResources\u201d) to cover\ndaily funding needs\nand to meet strategic\nliquidity targets\nsized by the Required\nLiquidity Framework\nand Liquidity Stress\nTests. We actively\nmanage the amount of\nour Liquidity\nResources considering\nthe following\ncomponents: unsecured\ndebt maturity profile;\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition; funding\nneeds in a stressed\nenvironment, inclusive\nof contingent cash\noutflows; legal\nentity, regional and\nsegment liquidity\nrequirements;\nregulatory\nrequirements; and\ncollateral\nrequirements.

We\npursue a strategy of\ndiversification of\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding sources (by\nproduct, investor and\nregion) and attempt to\nensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities\nequals or exceeds the\nexpected holding\nperiod of the assets\nbeing financed. Our\ngoal is to achieve an\noptimal mix of durable\nsecured and unsecured\nfinancing. We fund our\nbalance sheet on a\nglobal basis through\ndiverse sources. These\nsources include our\nequity capital,\nborrowings, securities\nsold under agreements\nto repurchase,\nsecurities lending,\ndeposits, letters of\ncredit and lines of\ncredit. We have active\nfinancing programs for\nboth standard and\nstructured products\ntargeting global\ninvestors and\ncurrencies. Secured\nFinancing The liquid\nnature of the\nmarketable securities\nand short-term\nreceivables arising\nprincipally from sales\nand trading\n\nactivities in the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment provides us\nwith flexibility in\nmanaging the\ncomposition of our\nbalance sheet. Secured\nfinancing investors\nprincipally focus on\nthe quality of the\neligible collateral\nposted. Accordingly,\nwe actively manage our\nsecured financings\nbased on the quality\nof the assets being\nfunded. We have\nestablished longer\ntenor secured funding\nrequirements for less\nliquid asset classes,\nfor which funding may\nbe at risk in the\nevent of a market\ndisruption. We define\nhighly liquid assets\nas government-issued\nor government-\nguaranteed securities\nwith a high degree of\nfundability and less\nliquid assets as those\nthat do not meet these\ncriteria. To further\nminimize the\nrefinancing risk of\nsecured financing for\nless liquid assets, we\nhave established\nconcentration limits\nto diversify our\ninvestor base and\nreduce the amount of\nmonthly maturities for\nsecured financing of\nless liquid assets.\nFurthermore, we obtain\nterm secured funding\nliabilities in excess\nof less liquid\ninventory as an\nadditional risk\nmitigant to replace\nmaturing trades in the\nevent that secured\nfinancing markets, or\nour ability to access\nthem, become limited.\nAs a component of the\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework,\nwe hold a portion of\nour Liquidity\nResources against the\npotential disruption\nto our secured\nfinancing\ncapabilities.

Original maturity\nin the table is\ngenerally based on\ncontractual final\nmaturity.

We\nbelieve that accessing\ndebt investors through\nmultiple distribution\nchannels helps provide\nconsistent access to\nthe unsecured markets.\nIn addition, the\nissuance of borrowings\nwith original\nmaturities greater\nthan one year allows\nus to reduce reliance\non short-term credit\nsensitive instruments.\nBorrowings with\noriginal maturities\ngreater than one year\nare generally managed\nto achieve staggered\nmaturities, thereby\nmitigating refinancing\nrisk, and to maximize\ninvestor\ndiversification\nthrough sales to\nglobal institutional\nand retail clients\nacross regions,\ncurrencies and product\ntypes. The\navailability and cost\nof financing to us can\nvary depending on\nmarket conditions, the\nvolume of certain\ntrading and lending\nactivities, our credit\nratings and the\noverall availability\nof credit.

while it is\nrelatively unchanged under the Advanced\nApproach. Under the Standardized Approach, the\nincrease was primarily in Derivatives, driven\nby the impact of the early adoption of SA-CCR\non December 1, 2021. Under the Advanced\nApproach, CVA in Derivatives decreased due to\nlower credit spread volatility, offset by\nincreases in Investment securities from the\nE*TRADE acquisition now being risk-weighted\nunder the Advanced Approach, event lending\nwithin the Institutional Securities business\nsegment, as well as equity investments and\nother credit risk. Market risk RWA decreased\nin 2021 under the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches, primarily due to a decrease in VaR\nmainly as a result of reduced volatility as\nthe peak COVID-19 market stress in 2020 is no\nlonger included in VaR. G-SIB Capital\nSurcharge We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject\nto an additional risk-based capital surcharge,\nthe G-SIB capital surcharge, which must be\nsatisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nand which functions as an extension of the\ncapital conservation buffer. The surcharge is\ncalculated based on the G-SIB\u2019s size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, and complexity and substitutability\n(\u201cMethod 1\u201d) or use of short-term wholesale\nfunding (\u201cMethod 2\u201d), whichever is higher.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt\nand Clean Holding Company Requirements The\nFederal Reserve has established external TLAC,\nlong-term debt (\u201cLTD\u201d) and clean holding\ncompany requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S.\nG-SIBs (\u201ccovered BHCs\u201d), including the Parent\nCompany. These requirements are designed to\nensure that covered BHCs will have enough\nloss-absorbing resources at the point of\nfailure to be recapitalized through the\nconversion of eligible LTD to equity or\notherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD\nor other forms of TLAC where an SPOE\nresolution strategy is used (see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial\nHolding Company\u2014Resolution and Recovery\nPlanning\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory\nand Compliance Risk\u201d). These TLAC and eligible\nLTD requirements include various restrictions,\nsuch as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued\nby the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a\nmaturity of one year or more from the date of\nissuance; and not contain certain embedded\nfeatures, such as a principal or redemption\namount subject to reduction based on the\nperformance of an asset, entity or index, or a\nsimilar feature. In addition, the requirements\nprovide permanent grandfathering for debt\ninstruments issued prior to December 31, 2016\nthat would be eligible LTD but for having\nimpermissible acceleration clauses or being\ngoverned by foreign law. A covered BHC is also\nrequired to maintain minimum external TLAC\nequal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA\nor (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure\n(the denominator of its SLR). Covered BHCs\nmust also meet a minimum external LTD\nrequirement equal to the greater of (i) total\nRWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the\nhigher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB\ncapital surcharge applicable to the Parent\nCompany or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage\nexposure. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer\nrequirements on top of both the risk-based and\nleverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum\nrequirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is\nequal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB\nsurcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a\npercentage of total RWA. The leverage\nexposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of\nour total leverage exposure. Failure to\nmaintain the buffers would result in\nrestrictions on our ability to make capital\ndistributions, including the payment of\ndividends and the repurchase of stock, and to\npay discretionary bonuses to executive\nofficers.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    48  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nRequired and Actual\nTLAC and Eligible LTD\nRatios\n                                              \n                            A\u2026                \n                            A\u2026                \n                            At         At     \n  $\u00a0                        D\u2026        De\u2026     \n  in    R\u2026       Re\u2026        3\u2026        31,     \n  m\u2026    M\u2026       Ra\u2026        2\u2026        20\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  E\u2026                     $  2\u2026     $  21\u2026     \n  T\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     1\u2026  %    21\u2026  %     4\u2026  %     47\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     7\u2026  %    9.5  %     1\u2026  %     18\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                     $  1\u2026     $  12\u2026     \n  L\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     9\u2026  %    9.0  %     3\u2026  %     26\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  R\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  as                                          \n  a     4\u2026  %    4.5  %     9\u2026  %     10\u2026  %  \n  %                                           \n  of                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n                                              \n1. Required ratios are inclusive of applicable\nbuffers. 2. External TLAC consists of Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1\ncapital (each excluding any noncontrolling\nminority interests), as well as eligible LTD.\n3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by\n50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be\npaid in more than one year but less than two\nyears from each respective balance sheet date.\nFurthermore, under the clean holding company\nrequirements, a covered BHC is prohibited from\nincurring any external debt with an original\nmaturity of less than one year or certain\nother liabilities, regardless of whether the\nliabilities are fully secured or otherwise\nsenior to eligible LTD, or entering into\ncertain other prohibited transactions. Certain\nother external liabilities, including those\nwith certain embedded features noted above,\nare subject to a cap equal to 5% of the\ncovered BHC\u2019s outstanding external TLAC\namount. Additionally, as of April 1, 2021, we\nand our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to\nmake certain deductions from regulatory\ncapital for investments in certain unsecured\ndebt instruments (including eligible LTD in\nthe TLAC framework) issued by the Parent\nCompany or other G-SIBs. We are in compliance\nwith all TLAC requirements as of December 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020. Capital Plans,\nStress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer The\nFederal Reserve has capital planning and\nstress test requirements for large BHCs, which\nform part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR\nframework. We must submit, on at least an\nannual basis, a capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate annual stress tests designed by us\nand the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal\nReserve may assess our systems and processes\nthat incorporate forward-looking projections\nof revenues and losses to monitor and maintain\nour internal capital adequacy. As banks with\nless than $250 billion of total assets, our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to\ncompany-run stress test regulatory\nrequirements. The capital plan must include a\ndescription of all planned capital actions\nover a nine-quarter planning horizon,\nincluding any issuance or redemption of a debt\nor equity capital instrument, any capital\ndistribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or\nstock repurchases) and any similar action that\nthe Federal Reserve determines could impact\nour consolidated\n\ncapital. The capital plan must include a\ndiscussion of how we will maintain capital\nabove the minimum regulatory capital ratios\nand how we will serve as a source of strength\nto our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under\nsupervisory stress scenarios. In addition, the\nFederal Reserve has issued guidance setting\nout its heightened expectations for capital\nplanning practices at certain large financial\ninstitutions, including us. As part of its\nannual capital supervisory stress testing\nprocess, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB\nfor each large BHC, including us. The SCB\napplies only with respect to Standardized\nApproach risk-based capital requirements and\nreplaced the Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB is the\ngreater of (i) the maximum decline in our\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the\nseverely adverse scenario over the supervisory\nstress test measurement period plus the sum of\nthe four quarters of planned common stock\ndividends divided by the projected RWAs from\nthe quarter in which the Firm\u2019s projected\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum in the supervisory stress test and\n(ii) 2.5%. The supervisory stress test assumes\nthat BHCs generally maintain a constant level\nof assets and RWAs throughout the projection\nperiod. The SCB incorporates the results of\nthe supervisory stress test results and\nincorporates four quarters of common stock\ndividends. Federal Reserve approval for\ncapital actions is required in some specific\ncircumstances. A firm\u2019s SCB is subject to\nrevision each year, taking effect from October\n1 to reflect the results of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual supervisory stress test. The\nFederal Reserve has discretion to recalculate\na firm\u2019s SCB outside of the October 1 annual\ncycle in certain circumstances. Our SCB will\nremain at 5.7% from October 1, 2021 through\nSeptember 30, 2022. Together with other\nfeatures of the regulatory capital framework,\nthis SCB results in an aggregate Standardized\nApproach Common Equity Tier 1 required ratio\nof 13.2%. The Federal Reserve has the\nauthority to impose restrictions on capital\nactions as a supervisory matter. In the second\nquarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve imposed\ncapital action restrictions on large BHCs,\nincluding us, which it modified in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 and subsequently extended.\nUnder the modified capital action restrictions\nannounced on December 18, 2020 and\nsubsequently extended by the Federal Reserve,\nin the first two quarters of 2021, large BHCs\nwere permitted to pay common stock dividends,\nprovided they did not increase the amount of\ncommon stock dividends to be larger than the\nlevel paid in the second quarter of 2020, and\nmake share repurchases that, in the aggregate,\ndid not exceed an amount equal to the average\nof the firm\u2019s net income for the four\npreceding calendar quarters; make share\nrepurchases that equal the amount of share\nissuances related to expensed employee\ncompensation; and redeem and make scheduled\npayments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2\ncapital instruments. The Federal Reserve\nsubsequently announced that the\n                                 \n  49    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nrestrictions described\nabove would end on\nJune 30, 2021 for all\nfirms whose capital\nlevels are above\nminimum risk-based\nrequirements in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\nannual supervisory\nstress test. Based on\nthe results of the\n2021 supervisory\nstress tests, the\ntemporary capital\naction supervisory\nrestrictions\npreviously applicable\nto us ended on June\n30, 2021. Beginning\nJuly 1, 2021, the Firm\nis permitted, in its\ndiscretion, to adjust\nits capital\ndistributions without\nseeking prior approval\nfrom the Federal\nReserve, provided that\nit remains in\ncompliance with all\napplicable regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding the SCB. We\ndisclosed a summary of\nthe results of our\ncompany-run stress\ntests on our Investor\nRelations website and\nannounced that our\nBoard of Directors\nauthorized the\nincrease of our\nquarterly common stock\ndividend to $0.70 per\nshare from $0.35 per\nshare beginning with\nthe common stock\ndividend announced on\nJuly 15, 2021 and\nauthorized the\nrepurchase of up to\n$12 billion of\noutstanding common\nstock from July 1,\n2021 through June 30,\n2022, from time to\ntime as conditions\nwarrant, which\nsupersedes the\nprevious common stock\nrepurchase\nauthorization. For the\n2022 capital planning\nand stress test cycle,\nwe are required to\nsubmit our capital\nplan and company-run\nstress test results to\nthe Federal Reserve by\nApril 5, 2022. The\nFederal Reserve is\nexpected to publish\nsummary results of the\nCCAR and Dodd-Frank\nAct supervisory stress\ntests of each large\nBHC, including us, by\nJune 30, 2022. We are\nrequired to disclose a\nsummary of the results\nof our company-run\nstress tests within 15\ndays of the date the\nFederal Reserve\ndiscloses the results\nof the supervisory\nstress tests.\nAttribution of Average\nCommon Equity\nAccording to the\nRequired Capital\nFramework Our required\ncapital (\u201cRequired\nCapital\u201d) estimation\nis based on the\nRequired Capital\nframework, an internal\ncapital adequacy\nmeasure. Common equity\nattribution to the\nbusiness segments is\nbased on capital usage\ncalculated under the\nRequired Capital\nframework, as well as\neach business\nsegment\u2019s relative\ncontribution to our\ntotal Required\nCapital. The Required\nCapital framework is a\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nmeasure, which is\ncompared with our\nregulatory capital to\nensure that we\nmaintain an amount of\ngoing concern capital\nafter absorbing\npotential losses from\nstress events, where\napplicable, at a point\nin time.

In\nline with our SPOE\nstrategy, the Parent\nCompany has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to its\nwholly owned, direct\nsubsidiary Morgan\nStanley Holdings LLC\n(the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d).\nIn addition, the\nParent Company has\nentered into an\namended and restated\nsupport agreement with\nits material entities\n(including the Funding\nIHC) and certain other\nsubsidiaries. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nContributable Assets\nto our material\nentities and/or the\nFunding IHC. The\nFunding IHC would be\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our\nmaterial entities. The\ncombined implication\nof the SPOE resolution\nstrategy and the\nrequirement to\nmaintain certain\nlevels of TLAC is that\nlosses in resolution\nwould be imposed on\nthe holders of\neligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\ncreditors of our\nmaterial entities and\nwithout requiring\ntaxpayer or government\nfinancial support. The\nobligations of the\nParent Company and the\nFunding IHC under the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement are\nin most cases secured\non a senior basis by\nthe assets of the\nParent Company (other\nthan shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets)\nand the assets of the\nFunding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our\nmaterial entities,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, with respect to\nthe secured assets,\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    50  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nFor more information\nabout resolution and\nrecovery planning\nrequirements and our\nactivities in these\nareas, including the\nimplications of such\nactivities in a\nresolution scenario,\nsee\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand\nRegulation\u2014Financial\nHolding\nCompany\u2014Resolution and\nRecovery Planning\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk.\u201d\n                                              \n  Regulatory Developments and Other Matters   \n                                              \nReplacement of London\nInterbank Offered Rate\nand Replacement or\nReform of Other\nInterest Rate\nBenchmarks\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave commissioned\ncommittees and working\ngroups of market\nparticipants and\nofficial sector\nrepresentatives to\nreplace LIBOR and\nreplace or reform\nother interest rate\nbenchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from use of the\nIBORs to alternative\nrates and other\npotential interest\nrate benchmark reforms\nis underway and will\ncontinue over the\ncourse of the next few\nyears.\n\nIn accordance with\nannouncements by the\nFinancial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d),\nwhich regulates LIBOR\npublication, and ICE\nBenchmark\nAdministration\nLimited, which\nadministers LIBOR\npublication, the\npublication of most\nnon-U.S. dollar LIBOR\nrates ceased as of the\nend of December 2021.\nWhile publication of\nthe one-, three- and\nsix-month Sterling and\nJapanese yen LIBOR\nsettings will continue\nat least until the end\nof 2022 on the basis\nof a \u201csynthetic\u201d\nmethodology (known as\n\u201csynthetic LIBOR\u201d),\nthese rates have been\ndesignated\nunrepresentative by\nthe FCA and are solely\navailable for use in\nlegacy transactions.\nFurthermore, while\ncertain U.S. dollar\nLIBOR tenors are\nexpected to continue\nto be published until\nJune 30, 2023, the\nU.S. banking agencies\nand the FCA have\nissued guidance\ninstructing banks to\ncease entering into\nnew contracts\nreferencing U.S.\ndollar LIBOR no later\nthan December 31,\n2021, with certain\nexceptions.\n\nAs of December 31,\n2021, our LIBOR-\nreferenced contracts\nwere primarily\nconcentrated in\nderivative contracts\nand to a lesser\nextent, loans,\nfloating rate notes,\npreferred shares,\nsecuritizations and\nmortgages. A\nsignificant majority\nof our derivative\ncontracts, and a\nmajority of our non-\nderivative contracts\ncontain fallback\nprovisions or\notherwise have an\nexpected path that\nwill allow for the\ntransition to an\nalternative reference\nrate upon the\ncessation of the\napplicable LIBOR rate.\n\nWhile we have made\nsubstantial progress\nin the transition away\nfrom the IBORs, we\nnonetheless currently\nremain party to a\nsignificant number of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR-\nlinked contracts. A\nsignificant majority\nof our U.S. dollar\nderivative contracts\ncontain IBOR fallback\nprovisions based in\nthe first instance on\nSOFR due to\nincorporation of the\nInternational Swaps\nand Derivatives\nAssociation (\u201cISDA\u201d)\nFallbacks Supplement\nor through amendment\nby adherence to the\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol. Further, to\nthe extent that a U.S.\ndollar LIBOR-linked\nderivative or non-\nderivative contract is\ngoverned by New York\nlaw, New York State\nhas enacted\n\nlegislation that is\nintended to minimize\nlegal and economic\nuncertainty following\nU.S. dollar LIBOR\u2019s\ncessation by replacing\nLIBOR references in\ncertain contracts\nunder certain\ncircumstances with a\nbenchmark based on\nSOFR, including any\nspread adjustment,\nrecommended by the\nFederal Reserve, the\nFederal Reserve Bank\nof New York or the\nAlternative Reference\nRates Committee. For\nthose U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-linked contracts\nwithout appropriate\nfallbacks and for\nwhich the New York\nState legislation is\nnot expected to apply,\nwe are actively\ndeveloping appropriate\ntransition plans in\nlight of the planned\nJune 30, 2023\ncessation date for the\nremaining U.S. dollar\nLIBOR tenors.\n\nFollowing the\ncessation or non-\nrepresentativeness\ndesignation of\nnon-U.S. dollar LIBOR\nrates as of December\n31, 2021, our non-U.S.\ndollar LIBOR-linked\ncontracts containing\nfallback provisions\ntransitioned to\nalternative reference\nrates through the\noperation of the\nfallbacks within the\ncontracts. For\nexample, as of the\nfirst reset date\nfollowing December 31,\n2021, derivative\ncontracts referencing\nnon-U.S. dollar LIBOR\nthat either\nincorporate the ISDA\nIBOR Fallbacks\nSupplement or that\nwere amended through\nadherence to the 2020\nIBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol, are or will\nbe valued using the\nadjusted version of\nthe applicable risk-\nfree reference rate\nselected as an\nalternative to the\nIBORs by the\nappropriate national\ncommittee ( e.g. ,\nSterling Overnight\nIndex Average rate in\nplace of Sterling\nLIBOR and the Tokyo\nOvernight Average rate\nin place of Japanese\nyen LIBOR).\n\nOf the remaining\nportion of non-U.S.\ndollar LIBOR-linked\ncontracts that have\nnot transitioned to\nalternative reference\nrates through the\noperation of fallback\nprovisions, many of\nthese contracts\nreference Sterling or\nJapanese yen LIBOR\nsettings for which a\nsynthetic rate will be\npublished at least\nuntil the end of 2022,\ntherefore these\ncontracts will\ncontinue to reference\nsynthetic LIBOR at\nleast for the duration\nof 2022.\n\nOur IBOR transition\nplan is overseen by a\nglobal steering\ncommittee, with senior\nmanagement oversight,\nand we continue to\nexecute against our\nFirm-wide IBOR\ntransition plan to\ncomplete the\ntransition to\nalternative reference\nrates, including\nimplementing\nregulatory guidance to\ncease entering into\nnew contracts\nreferencing U.S.\ndollar LIBOR after\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwith certain\nexceptions.\n\nSee also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Risk\nManagement\u201d for a\nfurther discussion of\nrisks related to the\nplanned replacement of\nthe IBORs and/or\nreform of interest\nrate benchmarks.\n                                 \n  51    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about\nRisk\n                                              \n  Risk Management                             \n                                              \n                                              \n   Overview                                   \n                                              \nRisk is an inherent\npart of our businesses\nand activities. We\nbelieve effective risk\nmanagement is vital to\nthe success of our\nbusiness activities.\nAccordingly, we have\nan Enterprise Risk\nManagement (\u201cERM\u201d)\nframework to integrate\nthe diverse roles of\nrisk management into a\nholistic enterprise\nstructure and to\nfacilitate the\nincorporation of risk\nassessment into\ndecision-making\nprocesses across the\nFirm.\n\nWe have policies and\nprocedures in place to\nidentify, measure,\nmonitor, escalate,\nmitigate and control\nthe principal risks\ninvolved in the\nactivities of the\nInstitutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments, as\nwell as at the Parent\nCompany level. The\nprincipal risks\ninvolved in our\nbusiness activities\ninclude market\n(including non-trading\nrisks), credit,\noperational, model,\ncompliance,\ncybersecurity,\nliquidity, strategic,\nreputational and\nconduct risk.\nStrategic risk is\nintegrated into our\nbusiness planning,\nembedded in the\nevaluation of all\nprincipal risks and\noverseen by the Board.\n\nThe cornerstone of our\nrisk management\nphilosophy is the\npursuit of risk-\nadjusted returns\nthrough prudent risk\ntaking that protects\nour capital base and\nfranchise. This\nphilosophy is\nimplemented through\nthe ERM framework.\nFive key principles\nunderlie this\nphilosophy: integrity,\ncomprehensiveness,\nindependence,\naccountability and\ntransparency. To help\nensure the efficacy of\nrisk management, which\nis an essential\ncomponent of our\nreputation, senior\n\nmanagement requires\nthorough and frequent\ncommunication and the\nappropriate escalation\nof risk matters. The\nfast-paced, complex\nand constantly\nevolving nature of\nglobal financial\nmarkets requires us to\nmaintain a risk\nmanagement culture\nthat is incisive,\nknowledgeable about\nspecialized products\nand markets, and\nsubject to ongoing\nreview and\nenhancement.\n\nOur risk appetite\ndefines the aggregate\nlevel and types of\nrisk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept to\nachieve its business\nobjectives, taking\ninto account the\ninterests of clients\nand fiduciary duties\nto shareholders, as\nwell as capital and\nother regulatory\nrequirements. This\nrisk appetite is\nembedded in our risk\nculture and linked to\nour short-term and\nlong-term strategic,\ncapital and financial\nplans, as well as\ncompensation programs.\nThis risk appetite and\nthe related Board-\nlevel risk limits and\nrisk tolerance\nstatements are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Risk Committee\nof the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d)\nand the Board on at\nleast an annual basis.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance Structure                   \n                                              \nRisk management at the\nFirm requires\nindependent Firm-level\noversight,\naccountability of our\nbusiness divisions,\nand effective\ncommunication of risk\nmatters across the\nFirm, to senior\nmanagement and\nultimately to the\nBoard.

In\naddition to regular\nreports to the BAC,\nthe Chief Audit\nOfficer, who reports\nfunctionally to the\nBAC and\nadministratively to\nthe Chief Executive\nOfficer, periodically\nreports to the BRC and\nBOTC on various\nmatters of risks and\ncontrols.\n                                              \n  Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees    \n                                              \nEmployees of the Firm\nare accountable for\nconducting themselves\nin accordance with our\ncore values: Put\nClients First, Do the\nRight Thing, Lead with\nExceptional Ideas,\nCommit to Diversity\nand Inclusion, and\nGive Back . We are\ncommitted to\nreinforcing and\nconfirming adherence\nto our core values\nthrough our governance\nframework, tone from\nthe top, management\noversight, risk\nmanagement and\ncontrols, and three\nlines of defense\nstructure (business,\ncontrol functions such\nas Risk Management and\nCompliance, and\nInternal Audit).\n\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\noverseeing the Firm\u2019s\npractices and\nprocedures relating to\nculture, values and\nconduct, as set forth\nin the Firm\u2019s\nCorporate Governance\nPolicies. Our Culture,\nValues and Conduct\nCommittee, along with\nthe Compliance and\nConduct Risk\nCommittee, are the\nsenior management\ncommittees that\noversee the Firmwide\nculture, values and\nconduct program and\nreport regularly to\nthe Board. A\nfundamental building\nblock of this program\nis the Firm\u2019s Code of\nConduct, which\nestablishes standards\nfor employee conduct\nthat further reinforce\nthe Firm\u2019s commitment\nto integrity and\nethical conduct. Every\nnew hire and every\nemployee annually is\nrequired to certify to\ntheir understanding of\nand adherence to the\nCode of Conduct. The\nFirm\u2019s Global Conduct\nRisk Management Policy\nalso sets out a\nconsistent global\nframework for managing\nConduct Risk ( i.e. ,\nthe risk arising from\nmisconduct by\nemployees or\ncontingent workers)\nand Conduct Risk\nincidents at the Firm.\n\nThe employee annual\nperformance review\nprocess includes\nevaluation of employee\nconduct related to\nrisk management\npractices and the\nFirm\u2019s expectations.\nWe also have several\nmutually reinforcing\nprocesses to identify\nemployee conduct that\nmay have an impact on\nemployment status,\ncurrent year\ncompensation and/or\nprior year\ncompensation. For\nexample, the Global\nIncentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy sets\nforth standards for\nmanagers when making\nannual compensation\ndecisions and\nspecifically provides\nthat managers must\nconsider whether their\nemployees effectively\nmanaged and/or\nsupervised risk\ncontrol practices\nduring the performance\nyear. Management\ncommittees from\ncontrol functions\nperiodically meet to\ndiscuss employees\nwhose conduct is not\nin line with our\nexpectations. These\nresults are\nincorporated into\nidentified employees\u2019\nperformance reviews\nand compensation and\npromotion decisions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s clawback\nand cancellation\nprovisions apply to\ndeferred incentive\ncompensation and cover\na broad scope of\nemployee conduct,\nincluding any act or\nomission (including\nwith respect to direct\nsupervisory\nresponsibilities) that\nconstitutes a breach\nof obligation to the\nFirm or causes a\nrestatement of the\nFirm\u2019s financial\nresults, constitutes a\nviolation of the\nFirm\u2019s global risk\nmanagement principles,\npolicies and\nstandards, or causes a\nloss of revenue\nassociated with a\nposition on which the\nemployee was paid and\nthe employee operated\noutside of risk\nmanagement policies.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    54  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Risk Limits Framework                       \n                                              \nRisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nprovide the basis for\nmonitoring risk-taking\nactivity and avoiding\noutsized risk taking.\nOur risk-taking\ncapacity is sized\nthrough the Firm\u2019s\ncapital planning\nprocess where losses\nare estimated under\nthe Firm\u2019s BHC\nSeverely Adverse\nstress testing\nscenario. We also\nmaintain a\ncomprehensive suite of\nrisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nto support and\nimplement our risk\nappetite statement.\nOur risk limits\nsupport linkages\nbetween the overall\nrisk appetite, which\nis reviewed by the\nBoard, and more\ngranular risk-taking\ndecisions and\nactivities.\n\nRisk limits, once\nestablished, are\nreviewed and updated\non at least an annual\nbasis, with more\nfrequent updates as\nnecessary. Board-level\nrisk limits address\nthe most important\nFirmwide aggregations\nof risk. Additional\nrisk limits approved\nby the FRC address\nmore specific types of\nrisk and are bound by\nthe higher-level Board\nrisk limits.\n                                              \n   Risk Management Process                    \n                                              \nIn subsequent\nsections, we discuss\nour risk management\npolicies and\nprocedures for our\nprimary risks involved\nin the activities of\nour Institutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments.\nThese sections and the\nestimated amounts of\nour risk exposure\ngenerated by our\nstatistical analyses\nare forward-looking\nstatements. However,\nthe analyses used to\nassess such risks are\nnot predictions of\nfuture events, and\nactual results may\nvary significantly\nfrom such analyses due\nto events in the\nmarkets in which we\noperate and certain\nother factors\ndescribed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk refers to\nthe risk that a change\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, spreads,\nindices, volatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity,\nwill result in losses\nfor a position or\nportfolio. Generally,\nwe incur market risk\nas a result of\ntrading, investing and\nclient facilitation\nactivities,\nprincipally within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment where the\nsubstantial majority\nof our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is\ngenerated. In\naddition, we incur\nnon-trading market\nrisk, principally\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments. The\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\n(including interest\nrate risk) from\nlending and deposit-\ntaking activities. The\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\nfrom capital\ninvestments in its\nfunds.\n\nMarket risk also\nincludes non-trading\ninterest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest\nrate risk in the\nbanking book (amounts\nclassified for\nregulatory capital\npurposes under the\nbanking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure\nthat a change in\ninterest rates will\nresult in prospective\nearnings changes for\nassets and liabilities\nin the banking book.\n\nSound market risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nculture. The various\nbusiness units and\ntrading desks are\nresponsible for\nensuring that market\nrisk exposures are\nwell-managed and\nprudent. The control\ngroups help ensure\nthat these risks are\nmeasured and closely\nmonitored and are made\ntransparent to senior\nmanagement. The Market\nRisk Department is\nresponsible for\nensuring the\ntransparency of\nmaterial market risks,\nmonitoring compliance\nwith established\nlimits and escalating\nrisk concentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nMarket Risk Department\nmonitors our risk\nagainst limits on\naggregate risk\nexposures, performs a\nvariety of risk\nanalyses, routinely\nreports risk\nsummaries, and\nmaintains our VaR and\nscenario analysis\nsystems. Market risk\nis also monitored\nthrough various\nmeasures: by use of\nstatistics (including\nVaR and related\nanalytical measures);\nby measures of\nposition size and\nsensitivity; and\nthrough routine stress\ntesting, which\nmeasures the impact on\nthe value of existing\nportfolios of\nspecified changes in\nmarket factors and\nscenarios designed by\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment in\ncollaboration with the\nbusiness units. The\nmaterial risks\nidentified by these\nprocesses are\nsummarized in reports\nproduced by the Market\nRisk Department that\nare circulated to and\ndiscussed with senior\nmanagement, the FRC,\nthe BRC and the Board.\n                                              \n  Trading Risks                               \n                                              \n                                              \n   Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market   \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nWe have exposures to a\nwide range of risks\nrelated to interest\nrates and credit\nspreads, equity\nprices, foreign\nexchange rates and\ncommodity prices as\nwell as the associated\nimplied volatilities\nand spreads of the\nglobal markets in\nwhich we conduct our\ntrading activities.\n\nWe are exposed to\ninterest rate and\ncredit spread risk as\na result of our\nmarket-making\nactivities and other\ntrading in interest\nrate-sensitive\nfinancial instruments\n(i.e., risk arising\nfrom changes in the\nlevel or implied\nvolatility of interest\nrates, the timing of\nmortgage prepayments,\nthe shape of the yield\ncurve and/or credit\nspreads). The\nactivities from which\nthose exposures arise\nand the markets in\nwhich we are active\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, the\nfollowing:\nderivatives, corporate\nand government debt\nacross both developed\nand emerging markets\nand asset-backed debt,\nincluding mortgage-\nrelated securities.\n\nWe are exposed to\nequity price and\nimplied volatility\nrisk as a result of\nmaking markets in\nequity securities and\nderivatives and\nmaintaining other\npositions, including\npositions in non-\npublic entities.\nPositions in non-\npublic entities may\ninclude, but are not\nlimited to, exposures\nto private equity,\nventure capital,\nprivate partnerships,\nreal estate funds and\nother funds. Such\npositions are less\nliquid, have longer\ninvestment horizons\nand are more difficult\nto hedge than listed\nequities.\n                                 \n  55    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nWe are exposed to\nforeign exchange rate\nand implied volatility\nrisk as a result of\nmaking markets in\nforeign currencies and\nforeign currency\nderivatives, from\nmaintaining foreign\nexchange positions and\nfrom holding non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated\nfinancial instruments.\n\nWe are exposed to\ncommodity price and\nimplied volatility\nrisk as a result of\nmarket-making\nactivities in\ncommodity products\nrelated primarily to\nelectricity, natural\ngas, oil and precious\nmetals. Commodity\nexposures are subject\nto periods of high\nprice volatility as a\nresult of changes in\nsupply and demand.\nThese changes can be\ncaused by weather\nconditions; physical\nproduction and\ntransportation; or\ngeopolitical and other\nevents that affect the\navailable supply and\nlevel of demand for\nthese commodities.\n\nWe manage our trading\npositions by employing\na variety of risk\nmitigation strategies.\nThese strategies\ninclude\ndiversification of\nrisk exposures and\nhedging. Hedging\nactivities consist of\nthe purchase or sale\nof positions in\nrelated securities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions). Hedging\nactivities may not\nalways provide\neffective mitigation\nagainst trading losses\ndue to differences in\nthe terms, specific\ncharacteristics or\nother basis risks that\nmay exist between the\nhedge instrument and\nthe risk exposure that\nis being hedged.\n\nWe manage the market\nrisk associated with\nour trading activities\non a Firmwide basis,\non a worldwide trading\ndivision level and on\nan individual product\nbasis. We manage and\nmonitor our market\nrisk exposures in such\na way as to maintain a\nportfolio that we\nbelieve is well-\ndiversified in the\naggregate with respect\nto market risk factors\nand that reflects our\naggregate risk\ntolerance as\nestablished by our\nsenior management.\n\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\napproved for the Firm\nacross all divisions\nworldwide. Additional\nmarket risk limits are\nassigned to trading\ndesks and, as\nappropriate, products\nand regions. Trading\ndivision risk\nmanagers, desk risk\nmanagers, traders and\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment monitor\nmarket risk measures\nagainst limits in\naccordance with\npolicies set by our\nsenior management.\n                                              \n  Value-at-Risk                               \n                                              \nThe statistical\ntechnique known as VaR\nis one of the tools we\nuse to measure,\nmonitor and review the\nmarket risk exposures\nof our trading\nportfolios. The Market\nRisk Department\ncalculates and\ndistributes daily VaR-\nbased risk measures to\nvarious levels of\nmanagement.\n\nWe estimate VaR using\na model based on a\none-year equal\nweighted historical\nsimulation for general\nmarket risk factors\nand name-specific risk\nin corporate equities\nand related\nderivatives, and Monte\nCarlo simulation for\nname-specific risk in\nbonds, loans and\nrelated derivatives.\nThe model constructs a\ndistribution of\nhypothetical daily\nchanges in the value\nof trading portfolios\nbased on historical\nobservation of\n\ndaily changes in key\nmarket indices or\nother market risk\nfactors, and\ninformation on the\nsensitivity of the\nportfolio values to\nthese market risk\nfactor changes.\n\nVaR for risk\nmanagement purposes\n(\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95%\nlevel of confidence\nover a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a\nuseful indicator of\npossible trading\nlosses resulting from\nadverse daily market\nmoves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the\nunrealized loss in\nportfolio value that,\nbased on historically\nobserved market risk\nfactor movements,\nwould have been\nexceeded with a\nfrequency of 5%, or\nfive times in every\n100 trading days, if\nthe portfolio were\nheld constant for one\nday.\n\nOur VaR model\ngenerally takes into\naccount linear and\nnon-linear exposures\nto equity and\ncommodity price risk,\ninterest rate risk,\ncredit spread risk and\nforeign exchange\nrates. The model also\ntakes into account\nlinear exposures to\nimplied volatility\nrisks for all asset\nclasses and non-linear\nexposures to implied\nvolatility risks for\nequity, commodity and\nforeign exchange\nreferenced products.\nThe VaR model also\ncaptures certain\nimplied correlation\nrisks associated with\nportfolio credit\nderivatives, as well\nas certain basis risks\n(e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit\nderivatives).\n\nWe use VaR as one of a\nrange of risk\nmanagement tools.\nAmong their benefits,\nVaR models permit\nestimation of a\nportfolio\u2019s aggregate\nmarket risk exposure,\nincorporating a range\nof varied market risks\nand portfolio assets.\nOne key element of the\nVaR model is that it\nreflects risk\nreduction due to\nportfolio\ndiversification or\nhedging activities.\nHowever, VaR has\nvarious limitations,\nwhich include, but are\nnot limited to: use of\nhistorical changes in\nmarket risk factors,\nwhich may not be\naccurate predictors of\nfuture market\nconditions and may not\nfully incorporate the\nrisk of extreme market\nevents that are\noutsized relative to\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior or\nreflect the historical\ndistribution of\nresults beyond the 95%\nconfidence interval;\nand reporting of\nlosses in a single\nday, which does not\nreflect the risk of\npositions that cannot\nbe liquidated or\nhedged in one day. A\nsmall proportion of\nmarket risk generated\nby trading positions\nis not included in\nVaR.\n\nThe modeling of the\nrisk characteristics\nof some positions\nrelies on\napproximations that,\nunder certain\ncircumstances, could\nproduce significantly\ndifferent results from\nthose produced using\nmore precise measures.\nVaR is most\nappropriate as a risk\nmeasure for trading\npositions in liquid\nfinancial markets and\nwill understate the\nrisk associated with\nsevere events, such as\nperiods of extreme\nilliquidity. We are\naware of these and\nother limitations and,\ntherefore, use VaR as\nonly one component in\nour risk management\noversight process.\nThis process also\nincorporates stress\ntesting and scenario\nanalyses and extensive\nrisk monitoring,\nanalysis and control\nat the trading desk,\ndivision and Firm\nlevels.\n\nWe update our VaR\nmodel in response to\nchanges in the\ncomposition of trading\nportfolios and to\nimprovements in\nmodeling techniques\nand systems\ncapabilities. We are\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    56  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \ncommitted to\ncontinuous review and\nenhancement of VaR\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in order\nto capture evolving\nrisks associated with\nchanges in market\nstructure and\ndynamics. As part of\nour regular process\nimprovements,\nadditional systematic\nand name-specific risk\nfactors may be added\nto improve the VaR\nmodel\u2019s ability to\nmore accurately\nestimate risks to\nspecific asset classes\nor industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR\nstatistics are\nestimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR\nshould not be viewed\nas predictive of our\nfuture revenues or\nfinancial performance\nor of our ability to\nmonitor and manage\nrisk. There can be no\nassurance that our\nactual losses on a\nparticular day will\nnot exceed the VaR\namounts indicated in\nthe following tables\nor that such losses\nwill not occur more\nthan five times in 100\ntrading days for a\n95%/one-day VaR. VaR\ndoes not predict the\nmagnitude of losses\nthat, should they\noccur, may be\nsignificantly greater\nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not\nreadily comparable\nacross firms because\nof differences in the\nfirms\u2019 portfolios,\nmodeling assumptions\nand methodologies.\nThese differences can\nresult in materially\ndifferent VaR\nestimates across firms\nfor similar\nportfolios. The impact\nof such differences\nvaries depending on\nthe factor history\nassumptions, the\nfrequency with which\nthe factor history is\nupdated and the\nconfidence level. As a\nresult, VaR statistics\nare more useful when\ninterpreted as\nindicators of trends\nin a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile rather than as\nan absolute measure of\nrisk to be compared\nacross firms.

We\nare primarily exposed\nto credit risk from\ninstitutions and\nindividuals through\nour Institutional\nSecurities and Wealth\nManagement business\nsegments.\n\nWe incur credit risk\nin our Institutional\nSecurities business\nsegment through a\nvariety of activities,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 extending credit to\nclients through loans\nand lending\ncommitments;\n\n\u2022 entering into swap\nor other derivative\ncontracts under which\ncounterparties may\nhave obligations to\nmake payments to us;\n\n\u2022 providing short- or\nlong-term funding that\nis secured by physical\nor financial\ncollateral whose value\nmay at times be\ninsufficient to fully\ncover the repayment\namount;\n\n\u2022 posting margin\nand/or collateral to\nclearinghouses,\nclearing agencies,\nexchanges, banks,\nsecurities firms and\nother financial\ncounterparties;\n\n\u2022 placing funds on\ndeposit at other\nfinancial institutions\nto support our\nclearing and\nsettlement\nobligations; and\n\n\u2022 investing or trading\nin securities and loan\npools, whereby the\nvalue of these assets\nmay fluctuate based on\nrealized or expected\ndefaults on the\nunderlying obligations\nor loans.\n\nWe incur credit risk\nin our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment, primarily\nthrough lending to\nindividuals and\nentities, including,\nbut not limited to,\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 margin loans\ncollateralized by\nsecurities;\n\n\u2022 securities-based\nlending and other\nforms of secured\nloans, including\ntailored lending to\nhigh and ultra-high\nnet worth clients;\n\n\u2022 single-family\nresidential mortgage\nloans in conforming,\nnon-conforming or\nHELOC form primarily\nto existing Wealth\nManagement clients;\nand\n\n\u2022 employee loans\ngranted primarily to\nrecruit certain Wealth\nManagement\nrepresentatives.\n                                              \n  Monitoring and Control                      \n                                              \nThe Credit Risk\nManagement Department\n(\u201cCRM\u201d) establishes\nFirmwide practices to\nevaluate, monitor and\ncontrol credit risk at\nthe transaction,\nobligor and portfolio\nlevels. The CRM\napproves extensions of\ncredit, evaluates the\ncreditworthiness of\nthe counterparties and\nborrowers on a regular\nbasis, and helps\nensure that credit\nexposure is actively\nmonitored and managed.\nThe evaluation of\ncounterparties and\nborrowers includes an\nassessment of the\nprobability that an\nobligor will default\non its financial\nobligations and any\nlosses that may occur\nwhen an obligor\ndefaults. In addition,\ncredit risk exposure\nis actively managed by\ncredit professionals\nand committees within\nthe CRM and through\nvarious risk\ncommittees, whose\nmembership includes\nindividuals from the\nCRM. A comprehensive\nand global Credit\nLimits Framework\n\nis utilized to manage\ncredit risk levels\nacross the Firm. The\nCredit Limits\nFramework is\ncalibrated within our\nrisk tolerance and\nincludes single-name\nlimits and portfolio\nconcentration limits\nby country, industry\nand product type.\n\nThe CRM helps ensure\ntimely and transparent\ncommunication of\nmaterial credit risks,\ncompliance with\nestablished limits and\nescalation of risk\nconcentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement. The CRM\nalso works closely\nwith the Market Risk\nDepartment and\napplicable business\nunits to monitor risk\nexposures and to\nperform stress tests\nto identify, analyze\nand control credit\nrisk concentrations\narising from lending\nand trading\nactivities. The stress\ntests shock market\nfactors ( e.g. ,\ninterest rates,\ncommodity prices,\ncredit spreads), risk\nparameters ( e.g.,\nprobability of default\nand loss given\ndefault), recovery\nrates and expected\nlosses in order to\nassess the impact of\nstresses on exposures,\nprofit and loss, and\nour capital position.\nStress tests are\nconducted in\naccordance with our\nestablished policies\nand procedures.\n                                              \n  Credit Evaluation                           \n                                              \nThe evaluation of\ncorporate and\ninstitutional\ncounterparties and\nborrowers includes\nassigning credit\nratings, which reflect\nan assessment of an\nobligor\u2019s probability\nof default and loss\ngiven default. Credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the assessment\nof financial\nstatements; leverage;\nliquidity; capital\nstrength; asset\ncomposition and\nquality; market\ncapitalization; access\nto capital markets;\nadequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable; and, in\nthe case of certain\nloans, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements.\nThe CRM also evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, management\nand other factors such\nas country risks and\nlegal and contingent\nrisks that could\naffect the obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile.\nAdditionally, the CRM\nevaluates the relative\nposition of our\nexposure in the\nborrower\u2019s capital\nstructure and relative\nrecovery prospects, as\nwell as other\nstructural elements of\nthe particular\ntransaction.\n\nThe evaluation of\nconsumer borrowers is\ntailored to the\nspecific type of\nlending. Securities-\nbased loans are\nevaluated based on\nfactors that include,\nbut are not limited\nto, the amount of the\nloan and the amount,\nquality,\ndiversification, price\nvolatility and\nliquidity of the\ncollateral. The\nunderwriting of\nresidential real\nestate loans includes,\nbut is not limited to,\nreview of the\nobligor\u2019s debt-to-\nincome ratio, net\nworth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand industry standard\ncredit scoring models\n( e.g. , FICO scores).\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nindividual loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level, and\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis.\n\nCredit risk metrics\nassigned to our\nborrowers during the\nevaluation process are\nincorporated into the\nCRM maintenance of the\nallowance for credit\nlosses. Such allowance\nserves as a reserve\nfor probable inherent\nlosses, as well as\nprobable losses\nrelated to loans\nidentified as\nimpaired. For more\ninformation on the\nallowance for credit\nlosses, see Notes 2\nand 10 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                 \n  59    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nRisk Mitigation We may\nseek to mitigate\ncredit risk from our\nlending and trading\nactivities in multiple\nways, including\ncollateral provisions,\nguarantees and hedges.\nAt the transaction\nlevel, we seek to\nmitigate risk through\nmanagement of key risk\nelements such as size,\ntenor, financial\ncovenants, seniority\nand collateral. We\nactively hedge our\nlending and\nderivatives exposures.\nHedging activities\nconsist of the\npurchase or sale of\npositions in related\nsecurities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).\nAdditionally, we may\nsell, assign or\nsyndicate loans and\nlending commitments to\nother financial\ninstitutions in the\nprimary and secondary\nloan markets. In\nconnection with our\nderivatives trading\nactivities, we\ngenerally enter into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral\narrangements with\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide us\nwith the ability to\ndemand collateral, as\nwell as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset\nreceivables and\npayables covered under\nthe same master\nagreement in the event\nof a counterparty\ndefault. A collateral\nmanagement group\nmonitors collateral\nlevels against\nrequirements and\noversees the\nadministration of the\ncollateral function.\nSee Note 9 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation about our\ncollateralized\ntransactions.

Secured lending facilities include\nloans provided to clients, which are\ncollateralized by various assets, including\nresidential and commercial real estate\nmortgage loans, investor commitments for\ncapital calls, corporate loans and other\nassets. These facilities generally provide for\novercollateralization. Credit risk with\nrespect to these loans and lending commitments\narises from the failure of a borrower to\nperform according to the terms of the loan\nagreement and/or a decline in the underlying\ncollateral value. The Firm monitors collateral\nlevels against the requirements of lending\nagreements. See Note 16 to the financial\nstatements for information about our\nsecuritization activities. Commercial real\nestate loans are primarily senior, secured by\nunderlying real estate and are typically in\nterm loan form. In addition, as part of\ncertain of its trading and securitization\nactivities, Institutional Securities may also\nhold residential real estate loans.\nSecurities-based lending and Other includes\nfinancing extended to sales and trading\ncustomers and corporate loans purchased in the\nsecondary market.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    62  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nInstitutional\nSecurities Event-\nDriven Loans and\nLending Commitments\n                                              \n            At                                \n           De\u2026                                \n           31,                                \n           20\u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           Co\u2026                                \n           Ye\u2026                                \n            to                                \n           Ma\u2026                                \n  $                                           \n  in        <1       1-5       5-\u2026       To\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  n\u2026    $  951    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  4,\u2026  \n  of                                          \n  A\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026       1,\u2026       5,\u2026       8,\u2026       15\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  7,\u2026    $  10\u2026    $  20\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n            At                                \n           De\u2026                                \n           31,                                \n           20\u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           Co\u2026                                \n           Ye\u2026                                \n            to                                \n           Ma\u2026                                \n  $                                           \n  in        <1       1-5       5-\u2026       To\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026                                          \n  n\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  5,\u2026  \n  of                                          \n  A\u2026                                          \n  L\u2026       2,\u2026       7,\u2026       4,\u2026       14\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  4,\u2026    $  9,\u2026    $  6,\u2026    $  19\u2026  \n  e\u2026                                          \n                                              \n1.

Amounts may\nfluctuate from period\nto period as overall\nclient balances change\nas a result of market\nlevels, client\npositioning and\nleverage. Credit\nexposures arising from\nmargin lending\nactivities are\ngenerally mitigated by\ntheir short-term\nnature, the value of\ncollateral held and\nour right to call for\nadditional margin when\ncollateral values\ndecline. However, we\ncould incur losses in\nthe event that the\ncustomer fails to meet\nmargin calls and\ncollateral values\ndecline below the loan\namount. This risk is\nelevated in loans\nbacked by collateral\npools with significant\nconcentrations in\nindividual issuers or\nsecurities with\nsimilar risk\ncharacteristics.

Counterparty credit ratings are determined\ninternally by the CRM. We are exposed to\ncredit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives.\nCredit risk with respect to derivative\ninstruments arises from the possibility that a\ncounterparty may fail to perform according to\nthe terms of the contract. For a description\nof our risk mitigation strategies, see \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Risk Mitigation\u201d herein. Credit\nDerivatives A credit derivative is a contract\nbetween a seller and buyer of protection\nagainst the risk of a credit event occurring\non one\n\nor more debt obligations issued by a specified\nreference entity. The buyer typically pays a\nperiodic premium over the life of the contract\nand is protected for the period. If a credit\nevent occurs, the seller is required to make\npayment to the beneficiary based on the terms\nof the credit derivative contract. Credit\nevents, as defined in the contract, may be one\nor more of the following defined events:\nbankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the\nreferenced entity, failure to pay, obligation\nacceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium\nand restructuring. We trade in a variety of\ncredit derivatives and may either purchase or\nwrite protection on a single name or portfolio\nof referenced entities. In transactions\nreferencing a portfolio of entities or\nsecurities, protection may be limited to a\ntranche of exposure or a single name within\nthe portfolio. We are an active market maker\nin the credit derivatives markets. As a market\nmaker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on\nclient flow business and manage any residual\ncredit or correlation risk on a portfolio\nbasis. Further, we use credit derivatives to\nmanage our exposure to residential and\ncommercial mortgage loans and corporate\nlending exposures. The effectiveness of our\nCDS protection as a hedge of our exposures may\nvary depending upon a number of factors,\nincluding the contractual terms of the CDS. We\nactively monitor our counterparty credit risk\nrelated to credit derivatives. A majority of\nour counterparties are composed of banks,\nbroker-dealers, insurance and other financial\ninstitutions. Contracts with these\ncounterparties may include provisions related\nto counterparty rating downgrades, which may\nresult in the counterparty posting additional\ncollateral to us. As with all derivative\ncontracts, we consider counterparty credit\nrisk in the valuation of our positions and\nrecognize CVAs as appropriate within Trading\nrevenues in the income statement. For\nadditional credit exposure information on our\ncredit derivative portfolio, see Note 7 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                 \n  65    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nCountry Risk Country\nrisk exposure is the\nrisk that events in,\nor that affect, a\nforeign country (any\ncountry other than the\nU.S.) might adversely\naffect us. We actively\nmanage country risk\nexposure through a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement framework\nthat combines credit\nand market\nfundamentals and\nallows us to\neffectively identify,\nmonitor and limit\ncountry risk. Our\nobligor credit\nevaluation process may\nalso identify indirect\nexposures, whereby an\nobligor has\nvulnerability or\nexposure to another\ncountry or\njurisdiction. Examples\nof indirect exposures\ninclude mutual funds\nthat invest in a\nsingle country,\noffshore companies\nwhose assets reside in\nanother country to\nthat of the offshore\njurisdiction and\nfinance company\nsubsidiaries of\ncorporations. Indirect\nexposures identified\nthrough the credit\nevaluation process may\nresult in a\nreclassification of\ncountry risk. We\nconduct periodic\nstress testing that\nseeks to measure the\nimpact on our credit\nand market exposures\nof shocks stemming\nfrom negative economic\nor political\nscenarios. When deemed\nappropriate by our\nrisk managers, the\nstress test scenarios\ninclude possible\ncontagion effects and\nsecond order risks.\nThis analysis, and\nresults of the stress\ntests, may result in\nthe amendment of\nlimits or exposure\nmitigation. Our\nsovereign exposures\nconsist of financial\ncontracts and\nobligations entered\ninto with sovereign\nand local governments.\nOur non-sovereign\nexposures consist of\nfinancial contracts\nand obligations\nentered into primarily\nwith corporations and\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Index\ncredit derivatives are\nincluded in the\nfollowing country risk\nexposure table. Each\nreference entity\nwithin an index is\nallocated to that\nreference entity\u2019s\ncountry of risk. Index\nexposures are\nallocated to the\nunderlying reference\nentities in proportion\nto the notional\nweighting of each\nreference entity in\nthe index, adjusted\nfor any fair value\nreceivable or payable\nfor that reference\nentity. Where credit\nrisk crosses multiple\njurisdictions, for\nexample, a CDS\npurchased from an\nissuer in a specific\ncountry that\nreferences bonds\nissued by an entity in\na different country,\nthe fair value of the\nCDS is reflected in\nthe Net Counterparty\nExposure row based on\nthe country of the CDS\nissuer. Further, the\nnotional amount of the\nCDS adjusted for the\nfair value of the\nreceivable or payable\nis reflected in the\nNet Inventory row\nbased on the country\nof the underlying\nreference entity.\n\nTop 10 Non-U.S.\nCountry Exposures at\nDecember 31, 2021\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       G\u2026       \u2026       S\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       96       8       41  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       9\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  7\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n         \u2014       5       25       \u2026       34  \n         \u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  9\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       5\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014       1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n                                              \n1.

Operational Risk\nOperational risk refers to the risk of loss,\nor of damage to our reputation, resulting from\ninadequate or failed processes or systems,\nfrom human factors or from external events (\ne.g. , cyber attacks or third-party\nvulnerabilities) that may manifest as, for\nexample, loss of information, business\ndisruption, theft and fraud, legal and\ncompliance risks, or damage to physical\nassets. We may incur operational risk across\nthe full scope of our business activities,\nincluding revenue-generating activities and\nsupport and control groups ( e.g. ,\ninformation technology and trade processing).\nWe have established an operational risk\nframework to identify, measure, monitor and\ncontrol risk across the Firm. Effective\noperational risk management is essential to\nreducing the impact of operational risk\nincidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and\nreputational risks. The framework is\ncontinually evolving to account for changes in\nthe Firm and to respond to the changing\nregulatory and business environment. We have\nimplemented operational risk data and\nassessment systems to monitor and analyze\ninternal and external operational risk events,\nto assess business environment and internal\ncontrol factors, and to perform scenario\nanalysis. The collected data elements are\nincorporated in the operational risk capital\nmodel. The model encompasses both quantitative\nand qualitative elements. Internal loss data\nand scenario analysis results are direct\ninputs to the capital model, while external\noperational incidents, business environment\nand internal control factors are evaluated as\npart of the scenario analysis process. In\naddition, we employ a variety of risk\nprocesses and mitigants to manage our\noperational risk exposures. These include a\ngovernance framework, a comprehensive risk\nmanagement program and insurance. Operational\nrisks and associated risk exposures are\nassessed relative to the risk tolerance\nreviewed and confirmed by the Board and are\nprioritized accordingly. The breadth and range\nof operational risk are such that the types of\nmitigating activities are wide-ranging.\nExamples of activities include: continuous\nenhancement of defenses against cyber attacks;\nuse of legal agreements and contracts to\ntransfer and/or limit operational risk\nexposures; due diligence;\n\nimplementation of enhanced policies and\nprocedures; technology change management\ncontrols; exception management processing\ncontrols; and segregation of duties. Primary\nresponsibility for the management of\noperational risk is with the business\nsegments, the control groups and the business\nmanagers therein. The business managers\nmaintain processes and controls designed to\nidentify, assess, manage, mitigate and report\noperational risk. Each of the business\nsegments has a designated operational risk\ncoordinator. The operational risk coordinator\nregularly reviews operational risk issues and\nreports to our senior management within each\nbusiness. Each control group also has a\ndesignated operational risk coordinator and a\nforum for discussing operational risk matters\nwith our senior management. Oversight of\noperational risk is provided by the\nOperational Risk Oversight Committee, legal\nentity risk committees, regional risk\ncommittees and senior management. In the event\nof a merger; joint venture; divestiture;\nreorganization; or creation of a new legal\nentity, a new product, or a business activity,\noperational risks are considered, and any\nnecessary changes in processes or controls are\nimplemented. The Operational Risk Department\n(\u201cORD\u201d) provides independent oversight of\noperational risk and assesses, measures and\nmonitors operational risk against tolerance.\nThe ORD works with the divisions and control\ngroups to embed a transparent, consistent and\ncomprehensive framework for managing\noperational risk within each area and across\nthe Firm. The ORD scope includes oversight of\ntechnology risk, cybersecurity risk,\ninformation security risk, the fraud risk\nmanagement and prevention program, and third-\nparty risk management (supplier and affiliate\nrisk oversight and assessment), among others.\nCybersecurity Our cybersecurity and\ninformation security policies, procedures and\ntechnologies are designed to protect our own,\nour client and our employee data against\nunauthorized disclosure, modification or\nmisuse and are also designed to address\nregulatory requirements. These policies and\nprocedures cover a broad range of areas,\nincluding: identification of internal and\nexternal threats, access control, data\nsecurity, protective controls, detection of\nmalicious or unauthorized activity, incident\nresponse and recovery planning. Business\nContinuity Management and Disaster Recovery\nThe Firm\u2019s business continuity and disaster\nrecovery programs are designed to provide\nassurance of business continuity in the event\nof disruptions impacting our people,\ntechnology, facilities and third parties, and\nto comply with regulatory requirements. The\nkey elements of these programs include crisis\nmanagement, business continuity planning,\n                                 \n  67    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \ndisaster recovery,\ntesting and\nverification, and\nprocess improvement.\n                                              \n   Third-Party Risk Management                \n                                              \nIn connection with our\nongoing operations, we\nutilize the services\nof third-party\nsuppliers, which we\nanticipate will\ncontinue and may\nincrease in the\nfuture. These services\ninclude, for example,\noutsourced processing\nand support functions\nand other professional\nservices. Our risk-\nbased approach to\nmanaging exposure to\nthese services\nincludes the\nperformance of due\ndiligence,\nimplementation of\nservice level and\nother contractual\nagreements,\nconsideration of\noperational risks and\nongoing monitoring of\nthird-party suppliers\u2019\nperformance. We\nmaintain and continue\nto enhance our third-\nparty risk management\nprogram, which is\ndesigned to align with\nour risk tolerance and\nmeet regulatory\nrequirements. The\nprogram includes\nappropriate\ngovernance, policies,\nprocedures and\nenabling technology.\nThe third-party risk\nmanagement program\nincludes the adoption\nof appropriate risk\nmanagement controls\nand practices\nthroughout the third-\nparty management life\ncycle to manage risk\nof service failure,\nrisk of data loss and\nreputational risk,\namong others.\n                                              \n  Model Risk                                  \n                                              \nModel risk refers to\nthe potential for\nadverse consequences\nfrom decisions based\non incorrect or\nmisused model outputs.\nModel risk can lead to\nfinancial loss, poor\nbusiness and strategic\ndecision making or\ndamage to our\nreputation. The risk\ninherent in a model is\na function of the\nmateriality,\ncomplexity and\nuncertainty around\ninputs and\nassumptions.\n\nModel risk is\ngenerated from the use\nof models impacting\nfinancial statements,\nregulatory filings,\ncapital adequacy\nassessments and the\nformulation of\nstrategy.\n\nSound model risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nRisk Management\nFramework. The Model\nRisk Management\nDepartment (\u201cMRM\u201d) is\na distinct department\nin Risk Management\nresponsible for the\noversight of model\nrisk.\n\nThe MRM establishes a\nmodel risk tolerance\nin line with our risk\nappetite. The\ntolerance is based on\nan assessment of the\nmateriality of the\nrisk of financial loss\nor reputational damage\ndue to errors in\ndesign, implementation\nand/or inappropriate\nuse of models. The\ntolerance is monitored\nthrough model-specific\nand aggregate\nbusiness-level\nassessments, which are\nbased upon qualitative\nand quantitative\nfactors.\n\nA guiding principle\nfor managing model\nrisk is the \u201ceffective\nchallenge\u201d of models.\nThe effective\nchallenge of models is\ndefined as critical\nanalysis by objective,\ninformed parties who\ncan identify model\nlimitations and\nassumptions and drive\nappropriate changes.\nThe MRM provides\neffective challenge of\nmodels, independently\nvalidates and approves\nmodels for use,\nannually recertifies\nmodels, identifies and\ntracks remediation\nplans for model\nlimitations and\nreports on model risk\nmetrics. The\ndepartment also\noversees the\ndevelopment\n\nof controls to support\na complete and\naccurate Firmwide\nmodel inventory.\n                                              \n   Liquidity Risk                             \n                                              \nLiquidity risk refers\nto the risk that we\nwill be unable to\nfinance our operations\ndue to a loss of\naccess to the capital\nmarkets or difficulty\nin liquidating our\nassets. Liquidity risk\nalso encompasses our\nability (or perceived\nability) to meet our\nfinancial obligations\nwithout experiencing\nsignificant business\ndisruption or\nreputational damage\nthat may threaten our\nviability as a going\nconcern. Liquidity\nrisk also encompasses\nthe associated funding\nrisks triggered by the\nmarket or\nidiosyncratic stress\nevents that may\nnegatively affect our\nliquidity and may\nimpact our ability to\nraise new funding.\nGenerally, we incur\nliquidity and funding\nrisk as a result of\nour trading, lending,\ninvesting and client\nfacilitation\nactivities.\n\nOur Liquidity Risk\nManagement Framework\nis critical to helping\nensure that we\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity reserves and\ndurable funding\nsources to meet our\ndaily obligations and\nto withstand\nunanticipated stress\nevents. The Liquidity\nRisk Department is a\ndistinct area in Risk\nManagement responsible\nfor the oversight and\nmonitoring of\nliquidity risk. The\nLiquidity Risk\nDepartment ensures\ntransparency of\nmaterial liquidity and\nfunding risks,\ncompliance with\nestablished risk\nlimits and escalation\nof risk concentrations\nto appropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nLiquidity Risk\nDepartment establishes\nlimits in line with\nour risk appetite,\nidentifies and\nanalyzes emerging\nliquidity and funding\nrisks to ensure such\nrisks are\nappropriately\nmitigated, monitors\nand reports risk\nexposures against\nmetrics and limits,\nand reviews the\nmethodologies and\nassumptions\nunderpinning our\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nto ensure sufficient\nliquidity and funding\nunder a range of\nadverse scenarios.\n\nThe Treasury\nDepartment and\napplicable business\nunits have primary\nresponsibility for\nevaluating, monitoring\nand controlling the\nliquidity and funding\nrisks arising from our\nbusiness activities\nand for maintaining\nprocesses and controls\nto manage the key\nrisks inherent in\ntheir respective\nareas.

These\nfinancial instruments\ncan span a broad array\nof product types and\ngenerally include\nderivative, security,\nloan, and borrowing\npositions. As\ndescribed in Note 5,\nthese Level 3\nfinancial instruments\napproximate $11.9\nbillion and $6.2\nbillion, respectively,\nof financial assets\nand liabilities\ncarried at fair value\non a recurring basis\nat December 31, 2021.\nUnlike financial\ninstruments whose\ninputs are readily\nobservable and,\ntherefore, more easily\nindependently\ncorroborated, the\nvaluation of financial\ninstruments classified\nas Level 3 is\ninherently subjective\nand often involves the\nuse of unobservable\ninputs and proprietary\nvaluation models whose\nunderlying algorithms\nand valuation\nmethodologies are\ncomplex.\n\nWe identified the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis as a\ncritical audit matter\ngiven the Firm uses\ncomplex valuation\nmodels and/or model\ninputs that are not\nobservable in the\nmarketplace to\ndetermine the\nrespective fair\nvalues. Performing our\naudit procedures to\nevaluate the\nappropriateness of\nthese models and\ninputs involved a high\ndegree of auditor\njudgment,\nprofessionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, and an\nincreased extent of\ntesting.\n\nHow the Critical Audit\nMatter Was Addressed\nin the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures\nrelated to the\nvaluation of Level 3\nfinancial assets and\nliabilities carried at\nfair value on a\nrecurring basis\nincluded the\nfollowing, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 We tested the design\nand operating\neffectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrols that address\nfair value estimates,\nincluding model review\nand price\nverification. The Firm\nmaintains these\ninternal controls to\nassess the\nappropriateness of its\nvaluation\nmethodologies and the\nrelevant inputs and\nassumptions used to\ndetermine fair value\nestimates.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    70  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n\u2022 We independently\nevaluated the\nappropriateness of\nmanagement\u2019s\nsignificant valuation\nmethodologies,\nincluding the input\nassumptions,\nconsidering the\nexpected assumptions\nof other market\nparticipants and\nexternal data when\navailable.\n\n\u2022 We developed\nindependent fair value\nestimates for selected\nLevel 3 financial\ninstruments, using\nexternally sourced\ninputs and independent\nvaluation models, and\nused such estimates to\nfurther evaluate\nmanagement\u2019s fair\nvalue estimates. For\ncertain of our\nselected Level 3\nfinancial instruments,\nthis included a\ncomparison to the\nFirm\u2019s fair value\nestimates for similar\ntransactions and an\nevaluation of the\nFirm\u2019s assumptions\ninclusive of the\ninputs, as applicable.\n\n\u2022 We tested the\nrevenues arising from\nthe trade date fair\nvalue estimates for\nselected structured\ntransactions\nclassified as Level 3\nfinancial instruments.\nFor certain of our\nselected transactions,\nwe developed\nindependent fair value\nestimates to test the\nvaluation inputs and\nassumptions used by\nthe Firm and evaluated\nwhether these methods\nwere consistent with\nrelevant Firm\nvaluation policies.\n\n\u2022 We assessed the\nconsistency by which\nmanagement has applied\nsignificant and\nunobservable valuation\nassumptions used in\ndeveloping fair value\nestimates.\n\n\u2022 We performed a\nretrospective\nassessment of\nmanagement\u2019s fair\nvalue estimates for\ncertain of our\nselected Level 3\nfinancial instruments,\nfor which there were\nevents or transactions\noccurring after the\nvaluation date.

This business\ncombination was\nrecognized using the\nacquisition method of\naccounting.\nAccordingly, the\npurchase price was\nallocated to the\nassets acquired and\nliabilities assumed\nbased on their fair\nvalues, including\nidentified intangibles\nof approximately $4\nbillion. The\nintangibles included\ncustomer relationships\nof $1.5 billion and\nindefinite lived\nmanagement contracts\nof $2.1 billion.\nManagement, with the\nassistance of a\nvaluation specialist,\nestimated the fair\nvalue of the\nintangible assets by\ndiscounting the\nforecasted future cash\nflows. The\ndetermination of fair\nvalue of the\nidentified intangible\nassets involves\nsignificant estimates\nand assumptions\nrelated to forecasted\nfuture cash flows\nincluding revenue\ngrowth rates and the\nselection of the\ndiscount rates.\n\nWe identified the\nvaluation of customer\nrelationship and\nindefinite lived\nmanagement contract\nintangible assets as a\ncritical audit matter\nbecause the fair value\ndetermination requires\nmanagement to make\nsignificant estimates\nand assumptions in\ndetermining the\nforecasted future cash\nflows including\nrevenue growth rates\nand the selection of\nthe respective\ndiscount rates.\nPerforming audit\nprocedures to evaluate\nthe reasonableness of\nthese estimates and\nassumptions required a\nhigh degree of auditor\njudgment and an\nincreased extent of\neffort, including the\ninvolvement of our\nvaluation specialists.\n\nHow the Critical Audit\nMatter Was Addressed\nin the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures\nrelated to the\nvaluation of customer\nrelationship and\nindefinite lived\nmanagement contract\nintangible assets\nacquired as part of\nthe Eaton Vance\nacquisition included\nthe following, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 We performed\nsensitivity analyses\nto evaluate the impact\nof changes in\nassumptions on the\nvaluation of the\ncustomer relationship\nand indefinite lived\nmanagement contract\nintangible assets.\n\n\u2022 We tested the\noperating\neffectiveness of\ninternal controls over\nthe valuation\nmethodology used, the\ndetermination of\nforecasted future cash\nflows, assumptions\nrelating to revenue\ngrowth and the\nselection of the\ndiscount rates.\n\n\u2022 We assessed the\nknowledge, skill,\nability and\nobjectivity of\nmanagement\u2019s valuation\nspecialist and\nevaluated the work\nperformed.\n\n\u2022 We evaluated the\nappropriateness of the\nvaluation methodology\nused and the\nreasonableness of the\nforecasted future cash\nflows for the customer\nrelationship and\nindefinite lived\nmanagement contract\nintangible assets,\nspecifically the\nassumptions relating\nto the revenue growth\nrates. Further, we\nevaluated whether the\nassumptions used were\nreasonable considering\nexternal market and\nindustry data as well\nas the past\nperformance of Eaton\nVance.\n\n\u2022 We tested the source\ninformation underlying\nthe determination of\nthe revenue growth and\ndiscount rates and\nalso tested the\nmathematical accuracy\nof the calculations.\n\n\u2022 We developed a range\nof independent\nestimates of discount\nrates for the customer\nrelationship and\nindefinite lived\nmanagement contract\nintangible assets and\ncompared those to the\ndiscount rates\nutilized

Introduction and Basis of Presentation   \n                                              \nThe Firm Morgan\nStanley is a global\nfinancial services\nfirm that maintains\nsignificant market\npositions in each of\nits business\nsegments\u2014Institutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management.\nMorgan Stanley,\nthrough its\nsubsidiaries and\naffiliates, provides a\nwide variety of\nproducts and services\nto a large and\ndiversified group of\nclients and customers,\nincluding\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nindividuals. Unless\nthe context otherwise\nrequires, the terms\n\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d or\nthe \u201cFirm\u201d mean Morgan\nStanley (the \u201cParent\nCompany\u201d) together\nwith its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. See the\n\u201cGlossary of Common\nTerms and Acronyms\u201d\nfor the definition of\ncertain terms and\nacronyms used\nthroughout this Form\n10-K. A description of\nthe clients and\nprincipal products and\nservices of each of\nthe Firm\u2019s business\nsegments is as\nfollows: Institutional\nSecurities provides a\nvariety of products\nand services to\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nultra-high net worth\nclients. Investment\nBanking services\nconsist of capital\nraising and financial\nadvisory services,\nincluding the\nunderwriting of debt,\nequity and other\nsecurities, as well as\nadvice on mergers and\nacquisitions,\nrestructurings and\nproject finance. Our\nEquity and Fixed\nIncome businesses\ninclude sales,\nfinancing, prime\nbrokerage, market-\nmaking, Asia wealth\nmanagement services\nand certain business-\nrelated investments.\nLending activities\ninclude originating\ncorporate loans and\ncommercial real estate\nloans, providing\nsecured lending\nfacilities, and\nextending securities-\nbased and other\nfinancing to\ncustomers. Other\nactivities include\nresearch. Wealth\nManagement provides a\ncomprehensive array of\nfinancial services and\nsolutions to\nindividual investors\nand small to medium-\nsized businesses and\ninstitutions covering:\nfinancial advisor-led\nbrokerage and\ninvestment advisory\nservices; self-\ndirected brokerage\nservices; financial\nand wealth planning\nservices; workplace\nservices, including\nstock plan\nadministration;\nannuity and insurance\nproducts; securities-\nbased lending,\nresidential real\nestate loans and other\nlending products;\nbanking; and\nretirement plan\nservices. Investment\nManagement provides a\nbroad range of\ninvestment strategies\nand products that span\ngeographies, asset\nclasses, and public\nand private markets to\na diverse group of\nclients across\ninstitutional and\nintermediary channels.\nStrategies and\nproducts, which are\noffered through a\nvariety of investment\nvehicles, include\nequity, fixed income,\nalternatives and\nsolutions, and\nliquidity and overlay\nservices.\nInstitutional clients\ninclude defined\nbenefit/defined\ncontribution plans,\nfoundations,\nendowments, government\nentities, sovereign\nwealth funds,\ninsurance companies,\nthird-party fund\nsponsors and\n\ncorporations.\nIndividual clients are\ngenerally served\nthrough\nintermediaries,\nincluding affiliated\nand non-affiliated\ndistributors. Basis of\nFinancial Information\nThe financial\nstatements are\nprepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, which\nrequires the Firm to\nmake estimates and\nassumptions regarding\nthe valuations of\ncertain financial\ninstruments, the\nvaluations of goodwill\nand intangible assets,\nthe outcome of legal\nand tax matters,\ndeferred tax assets,\nACL, and other matters\nthat affect its\nfinancial statements\nand related\ndisclosures. The Firm\nbelieves that the\nestimates utilized in\nthe preparation of its\nfinancial statements\nare prudent and\nreasonable. Actual\nresults could differ\nmaterially from these\nestimates. The\nfinancial statements\nreflect the effects of\nthe following\nreclassifications to\nprior period amounts.\nThe Provision for\ncredit losses for\nloans and lending\ncommitments is\npresented as a\nseparate line in the\nincome statements.\nPreviously, the\nprovision for credit\nlosses for loans was\nincluded in Other\nrevenues, and the\nprovision for credit\nlosses for lending\ncommitments was\nincluded in Other\nexpenses. In addition,\neconomic hedges of\ncertain held-for-sale\nand held-for-\ninvestment loans,\nwhich were previously\nreported in Trading\nrevenues, are reported\nin Other revenues. The\nNotes are an integral\npart of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nThe Firm has evaluated\nsubsequent events for\nadjustment to or\ndisclosure in these\nfinancial statements\nthrough the date of\nthis report and has\nnot identified any\nrecordable or\ndisclosable events not\notherwise reported in\nthese financial\nstatements or the\nnotes thereto.\nConsolidation The\nfinancial statements\ninclude the accounts\nof the Firm, its\nwholly owned\nsubsidiaries and other\nentities in which the\nFirm has a controlling\nfinancial interest,\nincluding certain VIEs\n(see Note 16).\nIntercompany balances\nand transactions have\nbeen eliminated. For\nconsolidated\nsubsidiaries that are\nnot wholly owned, the\nthird-party holdings\nof equity interests\nare referred to as\nNoncontrolling\ninterests. The net\nincome attributable to\nNoncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as Net\nincome applicable to\nnoncontrolling\ninterests in the\nincome statement. The\nportion of\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nthat is attributable\nto noncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as\nNoncontrolling\ninterests, a component\nof Total equity, in\nthe balance sheet. For\nentities where the\ntotal equity\ninvestment at risk is\nsufficient to enable\nthe entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional\nsubordinated financial\nsupport and the equity\nholders bear the\nresidual economic\nrisks and returns of\nthe entity and have\nthe power to direct\nthe activities of the\nentity that most\nsignificantly affect\nits economic\nperformance, the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities it controls\neither through a\nmajority voting\ninterest or otherwise.\nFor VIEs ( i.e. ,\nentities\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    76  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthat do not meet the\naforementioned\ncriteria), the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities where it has\nthe power to make the\ndecisions that most\nsignificantly affect\nthe economic\nperformance of the VIE\nand has the obligation\nto absorb losses or\nthe right to receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be\nsignificant to the\nVIE. For investments\nin entities in which\nthe Firm does not have\na controlling\nfinancial interest but\nhas significant\ninfluence over\noperating and\nfinancial decisions,\nit applies the equity\nmethod of accounting\nwith net gains and\nlosses recorded within\nOther revenues (see\nNote 12) unless the\nFirm has elected to\nmeasure the investment\nat fair value, in\nwhich case net gains\nand losses are\nrecorded within\nInvestments revenues\n(see Note 5).

Significant Accounting Policies          \n                                              \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are\nrecognized when the\npromised goods or\nservices are delivered\nto our customers in an\namount that is based\non the consideration\nthe Firm expects to\nreceive in exchange\nfor those goods or\nservices when such\namounts are not\nprobable of\nsignificant reversal.\nInvestment Banking\nRevenues from\ninvestment banking\nactivities consist of\nrevenues earned from\nunderwriting,\nprimarily equity and\nfixed income\nsecurities and loan\nsyndications, and\nadvisory fees,\nprimarily for mergers,\nacquisitions and\nrestructurings.\nUnderwriting revenues\nare generally\nrecognized on trade\ndate if there is no\nuncertainty or\ncontingency related to\nthe amount to be paid.\nUnderwriting costs are\ndeferred and\nrecognized in\n\nthe relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems when the related\nunderwriting revenues\nare recorded. Advisory\nfees are recognized as\nadvice is provided to\nthe client, based on\nthe estimated progress\nof work and when\nrevenues are not\nprobable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nAdvisory costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems, including those\nreimbursed.\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee\nrevenues generally\nresult from\ntransaction-based\narrangements in which\nthe client is charged\na fee for the\nexecution of\ntransactions. Such\nrevenues primarily\narise from\ntransactions in equity\nsecurities; services\nrelated to sales and\ntrading activities;\nand sales of mutual\nfunds, alternative\nfunds, futures,\ninsurance products and\noptions, as well as\nrevenues from order\nflow payments for\ndirecting customer\norders to broker-\ndealers, exchanges,\nand market centers for\nexecution. Commission\nand fee revenues are\nrecognized on trade\ndate when the\nperformance obligation\nis satisfied. Asset\nManagement Revenues\nAsset management,\ndistribution and\nadministration fees\nare generally based on\nrelated asset levels\nbeing managed, such as\nthe AUM of a\ncustomer\u2019s account or\nthe net asset value of\na fund. These fees are\ngenerally recognized\nwhen services are\nperformed and the fees\nbecome known.\nManagement fees are\nreduced by estimated\nfee waivers and\nexpense caps, if any,\nprovided to the\ncustomer. Performance-\nbased fees not in the\nform of carried\ninterest are recorded\nwhen the annual\nperformance target is\nmet and the revenues\nare not probable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nSales commissions paid\nby the Firm in\nconnection with the\nsale of certain\nclasses of shares of\nits open-end mutual\nfund products are\naccounted for as\ndeferred commission\nassets and amortized\nto expense over the\nexpected life of the\ncontract. The Firm\nperiodically tests\ndeferred commission\nassets for\nrecoverability based\non cash flows expected\nto be received in\nfuture periods. Other\nasset management and\ndistribution costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems. Carried\nInterest The Firm is\nentitled to receive\nperformance-based fees\nin the form of carried\ninterest when the\nreturn in certain\nfunds exceeds\nspecified performance\ntargets. When the Firm\nearns carried interest\nfrom funds as\nspecified performance\nthresholds are met,\nthat carried interest\nand any related\ngeneral or limited\npartner interest are\naccounted for under\nthe equity method of\naccounting and\nmeasured based on the\nFirm\u2019s claim on the\nNAV of the fund at the\nreporting date, taking\ninto account the\ndistribution terms\napplicable to the\ninterest held. Such\nitems are reflected\nwithin Investment\nrevenues.\n                                 \n  77    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nSee Note 23 for information regarding the net\ncumulative unrealized amount of performance-\nbased fee revenues at risk of reversal. See\nNote 15 for information regarding general\npartner guarantees, which include potential\nobligations to return performance fee\ndistributions previously received. Other Items\nRevenues from certain commodities-related\ncontracts are recognized as the promised goods\nor services are delivered to the customer.\nReceivables from contracts with customers are\nrecognized in Customer and other receivables\nin the balance sheet when the underlying\nperformance obligations have been satisfied\nand the Firm has the right per the contract to\nbill the customer. Contract assets are\nrecognized in Other assets when the Firm has\nsatisfied its performance obligations but\ncustomer payment is conditional. Contract\nliabilities are recognized in Other\nliabilities when the Firm has collected\npayment from a customer based on the terms of\nthe contract but the underlying performance\nobligations are not yet satisfied. For\ncontracts with a term of less than one year,\nincremental costs to obtain the contract are\nexpensed as incurred. Revenues are not\ndiscounted when payment is expected within one\nyear. The Firm generally presents, net within\nrevenues, taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and\nconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing\ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a\ncustomer. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and\ncash equivalents consist of Cash and due from\nbanks and Interest bearing deposits with\nbanks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid\ninvestments with remaining maturities of three\nmonths or less from the acquisition date that\nare readily convertible to cash and are not\nheld for trading purposes. Cash and cash\nequivalents also include Restricted cash such\nas cash segregated in compliance with federal\nor other regulations, including minimum\nreserve requirements set by the Federal\nReserve Bank and other central banks, and the\nFirm\u2019s initial margin deposited with clearing\norganizations. Fair Value of Financial\nInstruments Instruments within Trading assets\nand Trading liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue, either as required or allowed by\naccounting guidance. These financial\ninstruments primarily represent the Firm\u2019s\ntrading and investment positions and include\nboth cash and derivative products. In\naddition, securities classified as AFS are\nmeasured at fair value. Gains and losses on\ninstruments carried at fair value are\nreflected in Trading revenues, Investments\nrevenues or Investment banking revenues in the\nincome statement, except for gains and losses\nrelated to Available-for-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d)\nsecurities (see \u201cAFS Investment Securities\u201d\nsec tion herein and Note 8) and derivatives\naccounted for as hedges, as well as economic\nderivative hedges associated with certain\nheld-for-sale and held-for-investment\ncorporate loans and lending commitments (see\n\u201cHedge Accounting\u201d and \u201cOther Hedges\u201d herein\nand Note 7). Interest income and interest\nexpense are recorded within the income\nstatement depending on the nature of the\ninstrument and related market conventions.\nWhen interest is included as a component of\nthe instruments\u2019 fair value, interest is\nrecorded within Trading revenues or\nInvestments revenues. Otherwise, it is\nrecorded within Interest income or Interest\nexpense. Dividend income is recorded in\nTrading revenues or Investments revenues\ndepending on the business activity. The fair\nvalue of OTC financial instruments, including\nderivative contracts related to financial\ninstruments and commodities, is presented in\nthe accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-\ncounterparty basis, when appropriate.\nAdditionally, the Firm nets the fair value of\ncash collateral paid or received against the\nfair value amounts recognized for net\nderivative positions executed with the same\ncounterparty under the same master netting\nagreement. Fair Value Option The Firm has\nelected to measure certain eligible\ninstruments at fair value, including\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, Loans and lending commitments, equity\nmethod investments and certain other assets,\nDeposits, Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, Other secured financings and\nBorrowings. Fair Value Measurement\u2014Definition\nand Hierarchy Fair value is defined as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the\n\u201cexit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is a market-based measure\nconsidered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific\nmeasure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available,\nassumptions are set to reflect those that the\nFirm believes market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date. Where the Firm manages a\ngroup of financial assets, financial\nliabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted\nfor as derivatives on the basis of its net\nexposure to either market risks or credit\nrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that\ngroup of financial instruments consistently\nwith how market participants would price the\nnet risk exposure at the measurement date. In\ndetermining fair value, the Firm uses various\nvaluation approaches and establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue that requires the most observable inputs\nbe used when available.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    78  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nObservable inputs are inputs that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability that were developed based on market\ndata obtained from sources independent of the\nFirm. Unobservable inputs are inputs that\nreflect assumptions the Firm believes other\nmarket participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability that are developed based on\nthe best information available in the\ncircumstances. The fair value hierarchy is\nbroken down into three levels based on the\nobservability of inputs as follows, with Level\n1 being the highest and Level 3 being the\nlowest level: Level 1. Valuations based on\nquoted prices in active markets that the Firm\nhas the ability to access for identical assets\nor liabilities. Valuation adjustments, block\ndiscounts and discounts for entity-specific\nrestrictions that would not transfer to market\nparticipants are not applied to Level 1\ninstruments. Since valuations are based on\nquoted prices that are readily and regularly\navailable in an active market, valuation of\nthese products does not entail a significant\ndegree of judgment. Level 2. Valuations based\non one or more quoted prices in markets that\nare not active or for which all significant\ninputs are observable, either directly or\nindirectly. Level 3. Valuations based on\ninputs that are unobservable and significant\nto the overall fair value measurement. The\navailability of observable inputs can vary\nfrom product to product and is affected by a\nwide variety of factors, including the type of\nproduct, whether the product is new and not\nyet established in the marketplace, the\nliquidity of markets and other characteristics\nparticular to the product. To the extent that\nvaluation is based on models or inputs that\nare less observable or unobservable in the\nmarket, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the\ndegree of judgment exercised by the Firm in\ndetermining fair value is greatest for\ninstruments categorized in Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. The Firm considers prices and\ninputs that are current as of the measurement\ndate, including during periods of market\ndislocation. In periods of market dislocation,\nthe observability of prices and inputs may be\nreduced for many instruments. This condition\ncould cause an instrument to be reclassified\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue may fall into different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total\nfair value amount is disclosed in the level\nappropriate for the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the total fair value of the\nasset or liability. Valuation Techniques Many\ncash instruments and OTC derivative contracts\nhave bid and ask prices that can be observed\nin the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the\nhighest price that a party is willing to pay\nfor an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest\nprice that a party is willing to accept for an\nasset. The Firm carries positions at the point\nwithin the bid-ask range that meets its best\nestimate of fair value. For offsetting\npositions in the same financial instrument,\nthe same price within the bid-ask spread is\nused to measure both the long and short\npositions. Fair value for many cash\ninstruments and OTC derivative contracts is\nderived using pricing models. Pricing models\ntake into account the contract terms, as well\nas multiple inputs, including, where\napplicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves,\ncorrelation, creditworthiness of the\ncounterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm,\noption volatility and currency rates. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty, and concentration risk and\nfunding in order to arrive at fair value.\nAdjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-\nderived mid-market amounts of Level 2 and\nLevel 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid\nor mid-ask spread required to properly reflect\nthe exit price of a risk position. Bid-mid and\nmid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed\nin trade activity, broker quotes or other\nexternal third-party data. Where these spreads\nare unobservable for the particular position\nin question, spreads are derived from\nobservable levels of similar positions. The\nFirm applies credit-related valuation\nadjustments to its Borrowings for which the\nfair value option was elected and to OTC\nderivatives. The Firm considers the impact of\nchanges in its own credit spreads based upon\nobservations of the secondary bond market\nspreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings. For OTC derivatives, the impact of\nchanges in both the Firm\u2019s and the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating is considered\nwhen measuring fair value. In determining the\nexpected exposure, the Firm simulates the\ndistribution of the future exposure to a\ncounterparty, then applies market-based\ndefault probabilities to the future exposure,\nleveraging external third-party CDS spread\ndata. Where CDS spread data are unavailable\nfor a specific counterparty, bond market\nspreads, CDS spread data based on the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating or CDS spread\ndata that reference a comparable counterparty\nmay be utilized. The Firm also considers\ncollateral held and legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that mitigate its exposure\nto each counterparty. Adjustments for model\nuncertainty are taken for positions whose\nunderlying models are reliant on significant\ninputs that are neither directly nor\nindirectly observable, hence requiring\nreliance on established theoretical concepts\nin their derivation. These adjustments are\nderived by making assessments of the possible\ndegree of variability using statistical\napproaches and market-based information where\npossible. The Firm may apply concentration\nadjustments to certain of its OTC derivative\nportfolios to reflect the additional cost of\nclosing out a particularly large risk\nexposure. Where possible,\n                                 \n  79    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthese adjustments are based on observable\nmarket information, but in many instances,\nsignificant judgment is required to estimate\nthe costs of closing out concentrated risk\nexposures due to the lack of liquidity in the\nmarketplace. The Firm applies an FVA in the\nfair value measurements of OTC\nuncollateralized or partially collateralized\nderivatives and in collateralized derivatives\nwhere the terms of the agreement do not permit\nthe reuse of the collateral received. In\ngeneral, FVA reflects a market funding risk\npremium inherent in the noted derivative\ninstruments. The methodology for measuring FVA\nleverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-related\nvaluation adjustment calculation\nmethodologies, which apply to both assets and\nliabilities. See Note 5 for a description of\nvaluation techniques applied to the major\ncategories of financial instruments measured\nat fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured\nat Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Certain\nof the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis. The Firm incurs losses or gains for any\nadjustments of these assets or liabilities to\nfair value. For assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, fair value is determined by using\nvarious valuation approaches. The same\nhierarchy for inputs as described above, which\nrequires that observable inputs be used when\navailable, is used in measuring fair value for\nthese items. For further information on\nfinancial assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis, see Note 5. Offsetting of\nDerivative Instruments In connection with its\nderivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and\ncollateral agreements with its counterparties.\nThese agreements provide the Firm with the\nright, in the event of a default by the\ncounterparty, to net a counterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under the agreement and to\nliquidate and set off cash collateral against\nany net amount owed by the counterparty.\nDerivatives with enforceable master netting\nagreements are reported net of cash collateral\nreceived and posted. However, in certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may not have such an\nagreement in place; the relevant insolvency\nregime may not support the enforceability of\nthe master netting agreement or collateral\nagreement; or the Firm may not have sought\nlegal advice to support the enforceability of\nthe agreement. In cases where the Firm has not\ndetermined an agreement to be enforceable, the\nrelated amounts are not offset (see Note 7).\nThe Firm\u2019s policy is generally to receive cash\nand/or securities posted as collateral (with\nrights of rehypothecation), irrespective of\nthe enforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In\ncertain cases, the Firm may agree for such\ncollateral to be posted to a third-party\ncustodian under a control agreement that\nenables it to take control of such collateral\nin the event of a counterparty default. The\nenforceability of the master netting agreement\nis taken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement practices and application of\ncounterparty credit limits. For information\nrelated to offsetting of derivatives, see Note\n7. Hedge Accounting The Firm applies hedge\naccounting using various derivative financial\ninstruments for the following types of hedges:\nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets\nand liabilities due to the risk being hedged\n(fair value hedges); and hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations whose\nfunctional currency is different from the\nreporting currency of the Parent Company (net\ninvestment hedges). These financial\ninstruments are included within Trading\nassets\u2014Derivative and other contracts or\nTrading liabilities\u2014Derivative and other\ncontracts in the balance sheet. For hedges\nwhere hedge accounting is being applied, the\nFirm performs effectiveness testing and other\nprocedures. Fair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate\nRisk The Firm\u2019s designated fair value hedges\nconsist of interest rate swaps designated as\nhedges of changes in the benchmark interest\nrate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and\nsenior borrowings. The Firm also designates\ninterest rate swaps as fair value hedges of\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate of\ncertain fixed rate deposits. The Firm is\npermitted to hedge the full, or part of the,\ncontractual term of the hedged instrument. The\nFirm uses regression analysis to perform an\nongoing prospective and retrospective\nassessment of the effectiveness of these\nhedging relationships. A hedging relationship\nis deemed effective if the change in fair\nvalue of the hedging instrument (derivative)\nand the change in fair value of the hedged\nitem (AFS security, deposit liability or\nborrowing), due to changes in the benchmark\ninterest rate, offset within a range of 80% to\n125%. The Firm considers the impact of\nvaluation adjustments related to counterparty\ncredit spreads and its own credit spreads to\ndetermine whether they would cause the hedging\nrelationship to be ineffective. For qualifying\nfair value hedges of benchmark interest rates,\nthe change in the fair value of the\nderivative, offset by the change in the fair\nvalue attributable to the change in the\nbenchmark interest rate risk of the hedged\nasset (liability), is recognized in earnings\neach period as a component of Interest income\n(expense). For AFS securities, the change in\nfair value of the hedged item due to changes\nother than the risk being hedged will continue\nto be reported in OCI. When a derivative is\nde-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    80  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nremaining on the\nhedged asset\n(liability) is\namortized to Interest\nincome (expense) over\nthe remaining life of\nthe asset (liability)\nusing the effective\ninterest method. Net\nInvestment Hedges The\nFirm uses forward\nforeign exchange\ncontracts to manage a\nportion of the\ncurrency exposure\nrelating to its net\ninvestments in foreign\noperations. To the\nextent that the\nnotional amounts of\nthe hedging\ninstruments equal the\nportion of the\ninvestments being\nhedged and the\nunderlying exchange\nrate of the derivative\nhedging instrument is\nthe same as the\nexchange rate between\nthe functional\ncurrency of the\ninvestee and the\nintermediate parent\nentity\u2019s functional\ncurrency, it is\nconsidered to be\nperfectly effective,\nwith no income\nstatement recognition.\nThe gain or loss from\nrevaluing hedges of\nnet investments in\nforeign operations at\nthe spot rate is\nreported within AOCI.\nThe forward points on\nthe hedging\ninstruments are\nexcluded from hedge\neffectiveness testing\nand changes in the\nfair value of this\nexcluded component are\nrecorded currently in\nInterest income. Other\nHedges In addition to\nhedges that are\ndesignated and qualify\nfor hedge accounting,\nthe Firm uses\nderivatives to\neconomically hedge\ncredit risk associated\nwith certain held-for-\nsale and held-for-\ninvestment corporate\nloans and lending\ncommitments, and the\nrelated gains and\nlosses are reported\nwithin Other revenues\nin the income\nstatement. For further\ninformation on\nderivative instruments\nand hedging\nactivities, see Note\n7. AFS Investment\nSecurities AFS\nsecurities are\nreported at fair value\nin the balance sheet.\nInterest income,\nincluding amortization\nof premiums and\naccretion of\ndiscounts, is included\nin Interest income in\nthe income statement.\nUnrealized gains are\nrecorded in OCI, and\nunrealized losses are\nrecorded either in OCI\nor in Other revenues\nas described below.\nAFS securities in an\nunrealized loss\nposition are first\nevaluated to determine\nwhether there is an\nintent to sell or it\nis more likely than\nnot the Firm will be\nrequired to sell\nbefore recovery of the\namortized cost basis.\nIf so, the amortized\ncost basis is written\ndown to the fair value\nof the security such\nthat the entire\nunrealized loss is\nrecognized in Other\nrevenues, and any\npreviously established\nACL is written off.\nFor all other AFS\nsecurities in an\nunrealized loss\nposition, any portion\nof unrealized losses\nrepresenting a credit\nloss is recognized in\nOther revenues and as\nan increase to the ACL\nfor AFS securities,\nwith the remainder of\nunrealized losses\nrecognized in OCI. A\ncredit loss exists if\nthe Firm does not\nexpect to recover the\namortized cost basis\nof the security. When\nconsidering whether a\ncredit loss exists,\nthe Firm considers\nrelevant information,\nincluding:\n\u2022 guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the\nU.S. government;\n\n\u2022 the extent to which the fair value has been\nless than the amortized cost basis;\n\n\u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to\nthe security, its industry or geographic area;\n\n\u2022 changes in the financial condition of the\nissuer of the security or, in the case of an\nasset-backed debt security, changes in the\nfinancial condition of the underlying loan\nobligors;\n\n\u2022 the payment structure of the debt security\nand the likelihood of the issuer being able to\nmake payments that increase in the future;\n\n\u2022 failure of the issuer of the security to\nmake scheduled interest or principal payments;\n\n\u2022 the current rating and any changes to the\nrating of the security by a rating agency.\n\nIf a credit loss exists, the Firm measures the\ncredit loss as the difference between the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected (discounted at the implicit interest\nrate at acquisition of the security or\ndiscounted at the effective yield for\nsecurities that incorporate changes in\nprepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost\nbasis of the security. Changes in prepayment\nassumptions alone are not considered to result\nin a credit loss. When estimating the present\nvalue of expected cash flows, information\nutilized includes the remaining payment terms\nof the security, prepayment speeds, financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and\nthe value of any underlying collateral.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                Provision     \n                 ACL            for           \n                                Credit        \n                                Losses        \n  AFS            Contra         Other         \n  securities     investment     revenue       \n                 securities                   \n                                              \nNonaccrual & ACL Charge-offs on AFS Securities\n\nAFS securities follow the same nonaccrual and\nwrite-off guidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses\u201d herein, except as set forth\nin \u201cModifications and Nonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by COVID-19\u201d herein.\n\nHTM Securities\n\nHTM securities are reported at amortized cost,\nnet of any ACL, in the balance sheet. Refer to\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d herein for\nguidance on the ACL determination. Interest\nincome, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts on HTM securities, is\nincluded in Interest income in the income\nstatement.\nLoans The Firm\naccounts for loans\nbased on the following\ncategories: loans held\nfor investment; loans\nheld for sale; and\nloans at fair value.\n                                 \n  81    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nNonaccrual All loan categories described below\nfollow the same nonaccrual and write-off\nguidance as discussed in \u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein. Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment are reported at\noutstanding principal adjusted for any charge-\noffs, the allowance for credit losses, any\nunamortized deferred fees or costs for\noriginated loans, and any unamortized premiums\nor discounts for purchased loans. Interest\nIncome. Interest income on performing loans\nheld for investment is accrued and recognized\nas interest income at the contractual rate of\ninterest. Purchase price discounts or\npremiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or\ncosts, are amortized into interest income over\nthe life of the loan to produce a level rate\nof return. Lending Commitments. The Firm\nrecords the liability and related expense for\nthe credit exposure related to commitments to\nfund loans. For more information regarding\nloan commitments, standby letters of credit\nand financial guarantees, see Note 15. For\nmore information regarding allowance for\ncredit losses, refer to \u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein. Loans Held for Sale Loans held\nfor sale are measured at the lower of cost or\nfair value, with valuation changes recorded in\nOther revenues. The Firm determines the\nvaluation allowance on an individual loan\nbasis, except for residential mortgage loans\nfor which the valuation allowance is\ndetermined at the loan product level. Any\ndecreases in fair value below the initial\ncarrying amount and any recoveries in fair\nvalue up to the initial carrying amount are\nrecorded in Other revenues. Increases in fair\nvalue above initial carrying value are not\nrecognized. Interest Income. Interest income\non loans held for sale is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of\ninterest. Loan origination fees or costs and\npurchase price discounts or premiums are\ndeferred as an adjustment to the loan\u2019s cost\nbasis until the related loan is sold and, as\nsuch, are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair\nvalue adjustments and the gain or loss\nrecognized at the time of sale. Lending\nCommitments. Commitments to fund mortgage\nloans held for sale are derivatives and are\nreported in Trading assets or Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheet with an\noffset to Trading revenues in the income\nstatement. For commitments to fund non-\nmortgage loans, the Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the fair value\nexposure below cost of such commitments in\nOther liabilities and accrued expenses in the\nbalance sheet with an offset to Other revenues\nin the income statement. Because loans and\nlending commitments held for sale are\nrecognized at the lower of cost or fair value,\nthe allowance for credit losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. Loans at\nFair Value Loans for which the fair value\noption is elected are carried at fair value,\nwith changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings. Loans carried at fair value are not\nevaluated for purposes of recording an\nallowance for credit losses. For further\ninformation on loans carried at fair value and\nclassified as Trading assets and Trading\nliabilities, see Note 5. Lending Commitments.\nThe Firm records the liability and related\nexpense for the fair value exposure related to\ncommitments to fund loans that will be\nmeasured at fair value. The liability is\nrecorded in Trading liabilities in the balance\nsheet, and the expense is recorded in Trading\nrevenues in the income statement. Because such\nloans and lending commitments are reported at\nfair value, the allowance for credit losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these\nloans. For further information on loans, see\nNote 10. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL\nfor financ ial instruments measured at\namortized cost and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures ( e.g., HFI loans and lending\ncommitments, HTM securities, customer and\nother receivables and certain guarantees)\nrepresents an estimate of expected credit\nlosses over the entire life of the financial\ninstrument. Factors considered by management\nwhen determining the ACL include payment\nstatus, fair value of collateral and expected\npayments of principal and interest, as well as\ninternal or external information relating to\npast events, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The Firm\nuses three forecasts that include assumptions\nabout certain macroeconomic variables,\nincluding, but not limited to, U.S. gross\ndomestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), equity market\nindices and unemployment rates, as well as\ncommercial real estate and home price indices.\nAt the conclusion of the Firm\u2019s reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of 13 quarters,\nthere is a gradual reversion back to\nhistorical averages. The ACL is measured on a\ncollective basis when similar risk\ncharacteristics exist for multiple\ninstruments, considering all available\ninformation relevant to assessing the\ncollectability of cash flows. Generally, the\nFirm applies a probability of default/loss\ngiven default model for instruments that are\ncollectively assessed, under which the ACL is\ncalculated as the product of probability of\ndefault, loss given default and exposure at\ndefault. These parameters are forecast for\neach\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    82  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ncollective group of\nassets using a\nscenario-based\nstatistical model. If\nthe instrument does\nnot share similar risk\ncharacteristics with\nother instruments,\nincluding when it is\nprobable that the Firm\nwill be unable to\ncollect the full\npayment of principal\nand interest on the\ninstrument when due,\nthe ACL is measured on\nan individual basis.\nThe Firm generally\napplies a discounted\ncash flow method for\ninstruments that are\nindividually assessed.\nThe Firm may also\nelect to use an\napproach that\nconsiders the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral when\nmeasuring the ACL if\nthe loan is collateral\ndependent ( i.e.,\nrepayment of the loan\nis expected to be\nprovided substantially\nby the sale or\noperation of the\nunderlying collateral\nand the borrower is\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty).\nAdditionally, the Firm\ncan elect to use an\napproach to measure\nthe ACL that considers\nthe fair value of\ncollateral where the\nborrower is required\nto, and reasonably\nexpected to,\ncontinually adjust and\nreplenish the amount\nof collateral securing\nthe instrument to\nreflect changes in the\nfair value of such\ncollateral. The Firm\nhas elected to use\nthis approach for\ncertain securities-\nbased loans, margin\nloans, securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell\nand securities\nborrowed. Credit\nquality indicators\nconsidered in\ndeveloping the ACL\ninclude: \u2022 Corporate\nloans, secured lending\nfacilities, commercial\nreal estate loans and\nsecurities, and other\nloans: Internal risk\nratings developed by\nthe Credit Risk\nManagement Department\nthat are refreshed at\nleast annually, and\nmore frequently as\nnecessary. These\nratings generally\ncorrespond to external\nratings published by\nS&P. The Firm also\nconsiders transaction\nstructure, including\ntype of collateral,\ncollateral terms and\nposition of the\nobligation within the\ncapital structure. In\naddition, for\ncommercial real\nestate, the Firm\nconsiders property\ntype and location, net\noperating income and\nLTV ratios, among\nother factors, as well\nas commercial real\nestate price and\ncredit spread indices\nand capitalization\nrates. \u2022 Residential\nreal estate loans:\nLoan origination Fair\nIsaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores\nas determined by\nindependent credit\nagencies in the U.S.\nand LTV ratios. \u2022\nEmployee loans:\nEmployment status,\nwhich includes those\ncurrently employed by\nthe Firm and for which\nthe Firm can deduct\nany unpaid amounts due\nto it through certain\ncompensation\narrangements; and\nthose no longer\nemployed by the Firm\nwhere such\narrangements are no\nlonger applicable.\nQualitative and\nenvironmental factors\nsuch as economic and\nbusiness conditions,\nthe nature and volume\nof the portfolio, and\nlending terms and the\nvolume and severity of\npast due loans are\nalso considered in the\nACL calculations.\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                 Provision    \n                 ACL             for          \n                                 Credit       \n                                 Losses       \n  Held for                       Provision    \n  investment     Contra asset    for credit   \n  loans                          losses       \n  Other                                       \n  instruments                                 \n  measured at                                 \n  amortized                                   \n  cost                           Other        \n  (e.g.,HTM      Contra asset    revenues     \n  securities                                  \n  and                                         \n  customer                                    \n  and other                                   \n  receivable\u2026                                 \n                                 Compensati\u2026  \n  Employee       Contra asset    and          \n  loans                          benefits     \n                                 expenses     \n  Held for       Other           Provision    \n  investment     liabilities     for credit   \n  lending        and accrued     losses       \n  commitments    expenses                     \n  Other                                       \n  off-balance    Other                        \n  sheet          liabilities     Other        \n  instruments    and accrued     expenses     \n  (e.g.,cert\u2026    expenses                     \n  guarantees)                                 \n                                              \nTroubled Debt\nRestructurings The\nFirm may modify the\nterms of certain loans\nfor economic or legal\nreasons related to a\nborrower\u2019s financial\ndifficulties by\ngranting one or more\nconcessions that the\nFirm would not\notherwise consider.\nSuch modifications are\naccounted for and\nreported as a troubled\ndebt restructuring\n(\u201cTDR\u201d), except for\ncertain modifications\nrelated to the\ncoronavirus disease\n(\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as noted\nin \u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein. A\nloan that has been\nmodified in a TDR is\ngenerally considered\nto be impaired and is\nevaluated\nindividually. TDRs are\nalso generally\nclassified as\nnonaccrual and may be\nreturned to accrual\nstatus only after the\nFirm expects repayment\nof the remaining\ncontractual principal\nand interest and there\nis sustained repayment\nperformance for a\nreasonable period.\nNonaccrual The Firm\nplaces financial\ninstruments on\nnonaccrual status if\nprincipal or interest\nis not expected when\ncontractually due or\nis past due for a\nperiod of 90 days or\nmore unless the\nobligation is well-\nsecured and is in the\nprocess of collection.\nFor borrowers impacted\nby COVID-19, see\n\u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein for\nadditional\nconsiderations. For\nany instrument placed\non nonaccrual status,\nthe Firm reverses any\nunpaid interest\naccrued with an\noffsetting reduction\nto Interest income.\nPrincipal and interest\npayments received on\nnonaccrual instruments\nare applied to\nprincipal if there is\ndoubt regarding the\nultimate\ncollectability of\nprincipal. If\ncollection of the\nprincipal is not in\ndoubt, interest income\nis realized on a cash\nbasis. If the\ninstrument is brought\ncurrent and neither\nprincipal nor interest\ncollection is in\ndoubt, instruments can\ngenerally return to\naccrual status, and\ninterest income can be\nrecognized.\nModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19 In the first\nquarter of 2020, the\nFirm elected to apply\nthe guidance issued by\nCongress in the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (\u201cCARES\nAct\u201d), as well as by\nthe U.S. banking\nagencies stating that\ncertain concessions\ngranted to borrowers\nthat are current on\nexisting loans, either\nindividually or as\npart of a program for\ncreditworthy\n                                 \n  83    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nborrowers who are\nexperiencing short-\nterm financial or\noperational problems\nas a result of\nCOVID-19, generally\nwould not be\nconsidered TDRs.\nAdditionally, these\nloans generally would\nnot be considered\nnonaccrual unless\ncollectability\nconcerns exist despite\nthe modification\nprovided. For loans\nremaining on accrual\nstatus, the Firm\nelected to co ntinue\nrecognizing interest\nincome during the\nmodification periods.\nThe CARES Act relief\nexpired on January 1,\n2022. ACL Charge-offs\nThe principal balance\nof a financial\ninstrument is charged\noff in the period it\nis deemed\nuncollectible,\nresulting in a\nreduction in the ACL\nand in the balance of\nthe financial\ninstrument in the\nbalance sheet. Accrued\ninterest receivable\nbalances that are\nseparately recorded\nfrom the related\nfinancial instruments\nare charged off\nagainst Interest\nincome when the\nrelated financial\ninstrument is placed\non nonaccrual status.\nAccordingly, the Firm\nelected not to measure\nan ACL for accrued\ninterest receivables.\nHowever, in the case\nof loans that are\nmodified as a result\nof COVID-19 and remain\non accrual status due\nto the relief noted in\n\u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein,\naccrued interest\nreceivable balances\nare assessed for any\nrequired ACL.\nTransfers of Financial\nAssets Transfers of\nfinancial assets are\naccounted for as sales\nwhen the Firm has\nrelinquished control\nover the transferred\nassets. Any related\ngain or loss on sale\nis recorded in Net\nrevenues. Transfers\nthat are not accounted\nfor as sales are\ntreated as\ncollateralized\nfinancings. Securities\nborrowed or purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nloaned or sold under\nagreements to\nrepurchase are treated\nas collateralized\nfinancings (see Note\n9).

Securities\nborrowed and\nsecurities loaned are\nrecorded at the amount\nof cash collateral\nadvanced or received.\nIn instances where the\nFirm is the lender in\nsecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions and is\npermitted to sell or\nrepledge these\nsecurities, the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral received is\nreported in Trading\nassets, and the\nrelated obligation to\nreturn the collateral\nis reported in Trading\nliabilities in the\nbalance sheet.\nSecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions where the\nFirm is the borrower\nare not included in\nthe balance sheet.\n\nIn order to manage\ncredit exposure\narising from these\ntransactions, in\nappropriate\ncircumstances, the\nFirm enters into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral agreements\nwith its\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide the\nFirm with the right,\nin the event of a\ndefault by the\ncounterparty, to net a\ncounterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under\nthe agreement and to\nliquidate and set off\ncollateral held by the\nFirm against the net\namount owed by the\ncounterparty. The\nFirm\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to take\npossession of\nsecurities purchased\nor borrowed in\nconnection with\nreverse repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions,\nrespectively, and to\nreceive cash and/or\nsecurities delivered\nunder repurchase\nagreements or\nsecurities loaned\ntransactions (with\nrights of\nrehypothecation). For\ninformation related to\noffsetting of certain\ncollateralized\ntransactions, see Note\n9.\nPremises, Equipment and Capitalized Software\nCosts\nPremises, equipment and capitalized software\ncosts consist of buildings, leasehold\nimprovements, furniture, fixtures, computer\nand communications equipment, power generation\nassets and capitalized software (externally\npurchased and developed for internal use).\nPremises, equipment and capitalized software\ncosts are stated at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization and are included\nin Other assets in the balance sheet.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided by\nthe straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nEstimated Useful Life of Assets\n                                              \n  in years                         Estimated  \n                                 Useful\u00a0Life  \n  Buildings                               39  \n  Leasehold      term of                      \n  improvemen\u2026    lease to25                   \n  Leasehold      term\u00a0of\u00a0                     \n  improvemen\u2026    lease\u00a0to15                   \n  Furniture                                   \n  and                                      7  \n  fixtures                                    \n  Computer                                    \n  and            3to9                         \n  communicat\u2026                                 \n  equipment                                   \n  Power                                       \n  generation     15to29                       \n  assets                                      \n  Capitalized                                 \n  software       2to10                        \n  costs                                       \n                                              \nPremises, equipment and capitalized software\ncosts are tested for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances suggest\nthat an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be\nfully recoverable.\nGoodwill and\nIntangible Assets The\nFirm tests goodwill\nand indefinite-lived\nintangible assets for\nimpairment on an\nannual basis and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\nThe Firm tests\ngoodwill for\nimpairment at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below the\nasset's business\nsegment. The Firm\ntests indefinite-lived\nintangible assets for\nimpairment at the\naggregate level of\nmanagement contracts.\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, the\nFirm has the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    84  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nmore likely than not that the fair value is\nless than its carrying amount, in which case\nthe quantitative test would be performed. When\nperforming a quantitative impairment test, the\nFirm compares the fair value with the carrying\namount. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying amount, the impairment loss is equal\nto the excess of the carrying value over the\nfair value, limited to the carrying amount.\nThe estimated fair values are derived based on\nvaluation techniques the Firm believes market\nparticipants would use. The estimated fair\nvalues are generally determined by utilizing a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology or\nmethodologies that incorporate price-to-book\nand price-to-earnings multiples of certain\ncomparable companies for goodwill impairment\ntesting. Intangible assets with a finite life\nare amortized over their estimated useful life\nand are reviewed for impairment on an interim\nbasis when impairment indicators are present.\nImpairment losses are recorded within Other\nexpenses in the income statement. Earnings per\nCommon Share Basic EPS is computed by dividing\nearnings available to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period.\nEarnings available to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders represents net income applicable\nto Morgan Stanley reduced by preferred stock\ndividends. Common shares outstanding include\ncommon stock and vested RSUs where recipients\nhave satisfied the relevant vesting terms.\nDiluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of\nall dilutive securities. Share-based awards\nthat pay dividend equivalents subject to\nvesting are included in diluted shares\noutstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury\nstock method. The Firm has granted PSUs that\nvest and convert to shares of common stock\nonly if predetermined performance and market\ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the PSUs are included in\ndiluted EPS based on the number of shares (if\nany) that would be issuable if the reporting\ndate was the end of the performance period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings\n(loss) per common share, see Note 18 to the\nfinancial statements. Deferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation The Firm measures\ncompensation expense for stock-based awards at\nfair value. The Firm determines the fair value\nof RSUs (including PSUs with non-market\nperformance conditions) based on the grant-\ndate fair value of its common stock, measured\nas the volume-weighted average price on the\ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs\nnot entitled to dividends until conversion is\nmeasured at VWAP reduced by the present value\nof dividends expected to be paid on the\nunderlying shares prior to scheduled\nconversion date. PSUs that contain market-\nbased conditions are valued using a Monte\nCarlo valuation model. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nCompensation expense for awards with\nperformance conditions is recognized based on\nthe probable outcome of the performance\ncondition at each reporting date. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market-based\nconditions is recognized irrespective of the\nprobability of the market condition being\nachieved and is not reversed if the market\ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards\ngenerally contain clawback and cancellation\nprovisions. Certain awards provide the Firm\ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a\nportion of the award under specified\ncircumstances. Compensation expense for those\nawards is adjusted for changes in the fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s common stock or the\nrelevant model valuation, as appropriate,\nuntil conversion, exercise or expiration.\nEmployee Stock Trusts In connection with\ncertain stock-based compensation plans, the\nFirm has established employee stock trusts to\nprovide, at its discretion, common stock\nvoting rights to certain RSU holders.\nFollowing the grant of an RSU award, when a\nstock trust is utilized, the Firm contributes\nshares to be held in the stock trust until the\nRSUs convert to common shares. The assets of\nthe employee stock trusts are consolidated\nwith those of the Firm and are generally\naccounted for in a manner similar to treasury\nstock, where the shares of common stock\noutstanding reported in Common stock issued to\nemployee stock trusts are offset by an equal\namount reported in Employee stock trusts in\nthe balance sheet. The Firm uses the grant-\ndate fair value of stock-based compensation as\nthe basis for recording the movement of the\nassets to or from the employee stock trusts.\nChanges in the fair value are not recognized\nas the Firm\u2019s stock-based compensation must be\nsettled by delivery of a fixed number of\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock. Deferred\nCash-Based Compensation Compensation expense\nfor deferred cash-based compensation awards is\ncalculated based on the notional value of the\naward granted, adjusted for changes in the\nfair value of the referenced investments that\nemployees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nThe Firm invests directly, as a principal, in\nfinancial instruments and other investments to\neconomically hedge certain of its obligations\nunder its deferred cash-based\n                                 \n  85    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ncompensation plans. Changes in the value of\nsuch investments are recorded in Trading\nrevenues and Investments revenues. Although\nchanges in compensation expense resulting from\nchanges in the fair value of the referenced\ninvestments will generally be offset by\nchanges in the fair value of investments made\nby the Firm, there is typically a timing\ndifference between the immediate recognition\nof gains and losses on the Firm\u2019s investments\nand the deferred recognition of the related\ncompensation expense over the vesting period.\nRetirement-Eligible Employee Compensation For\nyear-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-\nbased compensation awards anticipated to be\ngranted to retirement-eligible employees under\naward terms that do not contain a future\nservice requirement, the Firm accrues the\nestimated cost of the awards over the course\nof the calendar year preceding the grant date,\nwhich reflects the period over which the\ncompensation is earned. Carried Interest\nCompensation The Firm generally recognizes\ncompensation expense for any portion of\ncarried interest (both realized and\nunrealized) that is allocated to employees.\nFor information on performance-based fees in\nthe form of carried interest, which are\ndirectly related to carried interest\ncompensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014Carried\nInterest\u201d herein. Income Taxes Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based upon\nthe temporary differences between the\nfinancial statement and income tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using currently enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The\neffect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in\nincome tax expense (benefit) in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. Such effects\nare recorded in Provision for income taxes\nregardless of where deferred taxes were\noriginally recorded. The Firm recognizes net\ndeferred tax assets to the extent that it\nbelieves these assets are more likely than not\nto be realized. In making such a\ndetermination, the Firm considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence,\nincluding future reversals of existing taxable\ntemporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and\nresults of recent operations. When performing\nthe assessment, the Firm considers all types\nof deferred tax assets in combination with\neach other, regardless of the origin of the\nunderlying temporary difference. If a deferred\ntax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. If the\nFirm subsequently determines that it would be\nable to realize deferred tax assets in excess\nof their net recorded amount, it would make an\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes. The Firm recognizes tax\nexpense associated with Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income as it is incurred as part of the\ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period. Uncertain tax\npositions are recorded on the basis of a two-\nstep process, whereby (i) the Firm determines\nwhether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis\nof the technical merits of the position and\n(ii) for those tax positions that meet this\nthreshold, the Firm recognizes the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon ultimate settlement\nwith the related tax authority. Interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\nare recognized as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes. Foreign Currencies Assets\nand liabilities of operations with non-U.S.\ndollar functional currencies are translated at\nyear-end rates of exchange. Gains or losses\nresulting from translating foreign currency\nfinancial statements, net of hedge gains or\nlosses and related tax effects, are reflected\nin AOCI in the balance sheet. Gains or losses\nresulting from remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in net\nincome, and amounts recognized in the income\nstatement are translated at the rate of\nexchange on the respective date of recognition\nfor each amount. Accounting Updates Adopted in\n2020 Reference Rate Reform The Firm has\nadopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting\nupdate. There was no impact to the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements upon initial adoption.\nThis accounting update provides optional\naccounting relief to entities with contracts,\nhedge accounting relationships or other\ntransactions that reference LIBOR or other\ninterest rate benchmarks for which the\nreferenced rate is expected to be discontinued\nor replaced. The Firm is applying the\naccounting relief as relevant contract and\nhedge accounting relationship modifications\nare made during the course of the reference\nrate reform transition period. The optional\nrelief generally allows for contract\nmodifications solely related to the\nreplacement of the reference rate to be\naccounted for as a continuation of the\nexisting contract instead of as an\nextinguishment of the contract and would,\ntherefore, not trigger certain accounting\nimpacts that would otherwise be required. It\nalso allows entities to change certain\ncritical terms of existing hedge accounting\nrelationships that are affected by reference\nrate reform, and these changes would not\nrequire de-designating the hedge accounting\nrelationship. The optional relief currently\nends December 31, 2022. Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses The Firm has adopted\nthe Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\naccounting update.\n                                 \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    86  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nThis accounting update impacted the impairment\nmodel for certain financial assets measured at\namortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology\nto estimate expected credit losses over the\nentire life of the financial asset, recorded\nat inception or purchase. CECL replaced the\nincurred loss model previously applicable to\nloans held for investment, HTM securities and\nother receivables carried at amortized cost,\nsuch as employee loans. The update also\neliminated the concept of other-than-temporary\nimpairment for AFS securities and instead\nrequires impairments on AFS securities to be\nrecognized in earnings through an allowance\nwhen the fair value is less than amortized\ncost and a credit loss exists, and through a\npermanent reduction of the amortized cost\nbasis when the securities are expected to be\nsold before recovery of amortized cost. At\ntransition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of\nthis accounting standard resulted in an\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses of\n$ 131million with a corresponding reduction in\nRetained earnings of $ 100million, net of tax.\nThe adoption impact was primarily attributable\nto a $ 124million increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses on employee loans. 3.\nAcquisitions Acquisition of Eaton Vance On\nMarch 1, 2021, the Firm completed the\nacquisition of 100% of Eaton Vance Corp.\n(\u201cEaton Vance\u201d) in a stock and cash\ntransaction, which increased the scale and\nbreadth of the Investment Management business\nsegment. Total consideration for the\ntransaction was approximately $ 8.7billion,\nwhich consists of the $ 5.3billion fair value\nof 69million common shares issued from Common\nstock held in treasury and cash of\napproximately $ 3.4billion. Upon acquisition,\nthe assets and liabilities of Eaton Vance were\nadjusted to their respective fair values as of\nthe closing date of the transaction, including\nthe identifiable intangible assets acquired.\nIn addition, the excess of the purchase price\nover the fair value of the net assets acquired\nhas been recorded as goodwill. The fair value\nestimates used in valuing certain acquired\nassets and liabilities are based, in part, on\ninputs that are unobservable. For intangible\nassets, these include, but are not limited to,\nforecasted future cash flows, revenue growth\nrates, attrition rates and discount rates.\nEaton Vance Purchase\nPrice Allocation\n

The\nlevel of aggregation\nand breadth of\nproducts cause the\nrange of inputs to be\nwide and not evenly\ndistributed across the\ninventory of financial\ninstruments. Further,\nthe range of\nunobservable inputs\nmay differ across\nfirms in the financial\nservices industry\nbecause of diversity\nin the types of\nproducts included in\neach firm\u2019s inventory.\nGenerally, there are\nno predictable\nrelationships between\nmultiple significant\nunobservable inputs\nattributable to a\ngiven valuation\ntechnique. During\n2021, there were no\nsignificant revisions\nmade to the\ndescriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s significant\nunobservable inputs.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a higher (lower)\nfair value. \u2022\nComparable Bond or\nLoan Price. A pricing\ninput used when prices\nfor the identical\ninstrument are not\navailable. Significant\nsubjectivity may be\ninvolved when fair\nvalue is determined\nusing pricing data\navailable for\ncomparable\ninstruments. Valuation\nusing comparable\ninstruments can be\ndone by calculating an\nimplied yield (or\nspread over a liquid\nbenchmark) from the\nprice of a comparable\nbond or loan, then\nadjusting that yield\n(or spread) to derive\na value for the bond\nor loan. The\nadjustment to yield\n(or spread)\n\nshould account for\nrelevant differences\nin the bonds or loans\nsuch as maturity or\ncredit quality.\nAlternatively, a\nprice-to-price basis\ncan be assumed between\nthe comparable\ninstrument and the\nbond or loan being\nvalued in order to\nestablish the value of\nthe bond or loan. \u2022\nComparable Equity\nPrice. A price derived\nfrom equity raises,\nshare buybacks and\nexternal bid levels,\netc. A discount or\npremium may be\nincluded in the fair\nvalue estimate. \u2022\nContingency\nProbability.\nProbability associated\nwith the realization\nof an underlying event\nupon which the value\nof an asset is\ncontingent. \u2022 EBITDA\nMultiple/Exit\nMultiple. The ratio of\nEnterprise Value to\nEBITDA, where\nenterprise value is\nthe aggregate value of\nequity and debt minus\ncash and cash\nequivalents. The\nEBITDA multiple\nreflects the value of\nthe company in terms\nof its full-year\nEBITDA, whereas the\nexit multiple reflects\nthe value of the\ncompany in terms of\nits full-year expected\nEBITDA at exit. Either\nmultiple allows\ncomparison between\ncompanies from an\noperational\nperspective as the\neffect of capital\nstructure, taxation\nand depreciation/amort\nization is excluded.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a lower (higher)\nfair value. \u2022 Cash-\nSynthetic Basis. The\nmeasure of the price\ndifferential between\ncash financial\ninstruments and their\nsynthetic derivative-\nbased equivalents. The\nrange disclosed in the\nprevious table\nsignifies the number\nof points by which the\nsynthetic bond\nequivalent price is\nhigher than the quoted\nprice of the\nunderlying cash bonds.\n\u2022 Funding Spread. The\ncost of borrowing\ndefined as the\nincremental spread\nover the OIS rate for\na specific collateral\nrate (which refers to\nthe rate applicable to\na specific type of\nsecurity pledged as\ncollateral). \u2022 Loss\nGiven Default. Amount\nexpressed as a\npercentage of par that\nis the expected loss\nwhen a credit event\noccurs. \u2022 Margin Loan\nRate. The annualized\nrate that reflects the\npossibility of losses\nas a result of\nmovements in the price\nof the underlying\nmargin loan\ncollateral. The rate\nis calibrated from the\ndiscount rate, credit\nspreads and/or\nvolatility measures. \u2022\nWACC. WACC represents\nthe theoretical rate\nof return required to\ndebt and equity\ninvestors. The WACC is\nused in a discounted\ncash flow model that\ncalculates the value\nof the equity. The\nmodel assumes that the\ncash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections,\nare fully reflected in\nthe current equity\nvalue, while the debt\nto equity ratio is\nheld constant.\n                                 \n  97    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin an impact to the\nfair value, but the\nmagnitude and\ndirection of the\nimpact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is\nlong or short the\nexposure. \u2022\nCorrelation. A pricing\ninput where the payoff\nis driven by more than\none underlying risk.\nCorrelation is a\nmeasure of the\nrelationship between\nthe movement of two\nvariables ( i.e. , how\nthe change in one\nvariable influences a\nchange in the other\nvariable). \u2022 Credit\nSpread. The credit\nspread reflects the\nadditional net yield\nan investor can earn\nfrom a security with\nmore credit risk\nrelative to one with\nless credit risk. The\ncredit spread of a\nparticular security is\noften quoted in\nrelation to the yield\non a credit risk-free\nbenchmark security or\nreference rate. \u2022\nInterest Rate Curve.\nThe term structure of\ninterest rates\n(relationship between\ninterest rates and the\ntime to maturity) and\na market\u2019s measure of\nfuture interest rates\nat the time of\nobservation. An\ninterest rate curve is\nused to set interest\nrate and foreign\nexchange derivative\ncash flows and is a\npricing input used in\nthe discounting of any\nOTC derivative cash\nflow. \u2022 Volatility.\nThe measure of\nvariability in\npossible returns for\nan instrument given\nhow much that\ninstrument changes in\nvalue over time.\nVolatility is a\npricing input for\noptions, and,\ngenerally, the lower\nthe volatility, the\nless risky the option.\nThe level of\nvolatility used in the\nvaluation of a\nparticular option\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including the\nnature of the risk\nunderlying that\noption, the tenor and\nthe strike price of\nthe option. \u2022\nVolatility Skew.

The Firm\nmanages its exposure\nto these derivative\ncontracts through a\nvariety of risk\nmitigation strategies,\nwhich include managing\nthe credit and\ncorrelation risk\nacross single-name,\nnon-tranched indices\nand baskets, tranched\nindices and baskets,\nand cash positions.\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\nestablished for credit\nderivatives, and\nmarket risk measures\nare routinely\nmonitored against\nthese limits. The Firm\nmay also recover\namounts on the\nunderlying reference\nobligation delivered\nto the Firm under CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection was sold.\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS\nprotects the buyer\nagainst the loss of\nprincipal on a bond or\nloan in case of a\ndefault by the issuer.\nThe protection buyer\npays a periodic\npremium (generally\nquarterly) over the\nlife of the contract\nand is protected for\nthe period. The Firm,\nin turn, performs\nunder a CDS if a\ncredit event as\ndefined under the\ncontract occurs.\nTypical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay and\nrestructuring of the\nobligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.\nIndex and basket CDS\nare products where\ncredit protection is\nprovided on a\nportfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally,\nin the event of a\ndefault on one of the\nunderlying names, the\nFirm pays a pro rata\nportion of the total\nnotional amount of the\nCDS. The Firm also\nenters into tranched\nindex and basket CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection is provided\non a particular\nportion of the\nportfolio loss\ndistribution. The most\njunior tranches cover\ninitial defaults, and\nonce losses exceed the\nnotional of the\ntranche, they are\npassed on to the next\nmost senior tranche in\nthe capital structure.\nOther Credit\nContracts. The Firm\nhas invested in CLNs\nand CDOs, which are\nhybrid instruments\ncontaining embedded\nderivatives, in which\ncredit protection has\nbeen sold to the\nissuer of the note. If\nthere is a credit\nevent of a reference\nentity underlying the\ninstrument, the\nprincipal balance of\nthe note may not be\nrepaid in full to the\nFirm.\n\n8.

See Note\n15 for details of\ncurrent commitments to\nlend in the future.\nCredit Quality The CRM\nevaluates new obligors\nbefore credit\ntransactions are\ninitially approved and\nat least annually\nthereafter for\ncorporate and\ncommercial real estate\nloans. For Corporate,\nSecured lending\nfacilities and Other\nloans, credit\nevaluations typically\ninvolve the evaluation\nof financial\nstatements, assessment\nof leverage,\nliquidity, capital\nstrength, asset\ncomposition and\nquality, market\ncapitalization and\naccess to capital\nmarkets, cash flow\nprojections and debt\nservice requirements,\nand the adequacy of\ncollateral, if\napplicable. The CRM\nalso evaluates\nstrategy, market\nposition, industry\ndynamics, obligor\u2019s\nmanagement and other\nfactors that could\naffect an obligor\u2019s\nrisk profile. For\nCommercial real estate\nloans, the credit\nevaluation is focused\non property and\ntransaction metrics,\nincluding property\ntype, LTV ratio,\noccupancy levels, debt\nservice ratio,\nprevailing\ncapitalization rates\nand market dynamics.\nFor Residential real\nestate and Securities-\nbased loans, the\ninitial credit\nevaluation typically\nincludes, but is not\nlimited to, review of\nthe obligor\u2019s income,\nnet worth, liquidity,\ncollateral, LTV ratio\nand credit bureau\ninformation.\nSubsequent credit\nmonitoring for\nresidential real\nestate loans is\nperformed at the\nportfolio level.\nSecurities-based loan\ncollateral values are\nmonitored on an\nongoing basis.

Forward-\nStarting Secured\nFinancing Receivables.\nThis amount includes\nsecurities purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed that the Firm\nhas entered into prior\nto the balance sheet\ndate that will settle\nafter the balance\nsheet date. These\ntransactions are\nprimarily secured by\ncollateral from U.S.\ngovernment agency\nsecurities and other\nsovereign government\nobligations when they\nare funded. Central\nCounterparty. These\ncommitments relate to\nthe Firm\u2019s membership\nin certain\nclearinghouses and are\ncontingent upon the\ndefault of a\nclearinghouse member\nor other stress\nevents. Underwriting\nCommitments. The Firm\nprovides underwriting\ncommitments in\nconnection with its\ncapital raising\nsources to a diverse\ngroup of corporate and\nother institutional\nclients. Investment\nActivities. The Firm\nsponsors several non-\nconsolidated\ninvestment management\nfunds for third-party\ninvestors where it\ntypically acts as\ngeneral partner of,\nand investment advisor\nto, these funds and\ntypically commits to\ninvest a minority of\nthe capital of such\nfunds, with\nsubscribing third-\nparty investors\ncontributing the\nmajority.

The carrying amounts of derivative\ncontracts that meet the accounting definition\nof a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. For\nfurther information on derivative contracts,\nsee Note 7.\n2. These amounts include certain issued\nstandby letters of credit participated to\nthird parties, totaling $ 0.7billion of\nnotional and collateral/recourse, due to the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s obligations under these\narrangements. As of December 31, 2021, the\ncarrying amount of standby letters of credit\nand other financial guarantees issued includes\nan allowance for credit losses of $ 84million.\n3. Related to commercial and residential\nmortgage securitizations.\nTypes of Guarantees\nNon-Credit\nDerivatives. Certain\nderivative contracts\nmeet the accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee, including\ncertain written\noptions, contingent\nforward contracts and\nCDS (see Note 7\nregarding credit\nderivatives in which\nthe Firm has sold\ncredit protection to\nthe counterparty which\nare excluded from the\nprevious table). For\nnon-credit derivative\ncontracts that meet\nthe accounting\ndefinition of a\nguarantee the notional\namount is used as the\nmaximum potential\npayout for certain\nderivative contracts,\nsuch as written\ninterest rate caps and\nwritten foreign\ncurrency options. The\nFirm evaluates\ncollateral\nrequirements for all\nderivatives, including\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\naccounting definition\nof a guarantee. For\nthe effects of cash\ncollateral and\ncounterparty netting,\nsee Note 7. In certain\nsituations, collateral\nmay be held by the\nFirm for those\ncontracts that meet\nthe definition of a\nguarantee. Generally,\nthe Firm sets\ncollateral\nrequirements by\ncounterparty so that\nthe collateral covers\nvarious transactions\nand products and is\nnot allocated\nspecifically to\nindividual contracts.\nAlso, the Firm may\nrecover amounts\nrelated to the\nunderlying asset\ndelivered to the Firm\nunder the derivative\ncontract. Standby\nLetters of Credit and\nOther Financial\nGuarantees Issued. In\nconnection with its\ncorporate lending\nbusiness and other\ncorporate activities,\nthe Firm provides\nstandby letters of\ncredit and other\nfinancial guarantees\nto counterparties.\nSuch arrangements\nrepresent obligations\nto make payments to\nthird parties if the\ncounterparty fails to\nfulfill its obligation\nunder a borrowing\narrangement or other\ncontractual\nobligation. A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s standby\nletters of credit are\nprovided on behalf of\ncounterparties that\nare investment grade.\nIf the counterparty\nfails to fulfill its\ncontractual\nobligation, the Firm\nhas access to\ncollateral or recourse\nthat would approximate\nits obligation.\n                                  \n  115    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nMarket Value Guarantees. Market value\nguarantees are issued to guarantee timely\npayment of a specified return to investors in\ncertain affordable housing tax credit funds.\nThese guarantees are designed to return an\ninvestor\u2019s contribution to a fund and the\ninvestor\u2019s share of tax losses and tax credits\nexpected to be generated by a fund. Liquidity\nFacilities. The Firm has entered into\nliquidity facilities with SPEs and other\ncounterparties, whereby the Firm is required\nto make certain payments if losses or defaults\noccur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity\nprovider to municipal bond securitization SPEs\nand for standalone municipal bonds in which\nthe holders of beneficial interests issued by\nthese SPEs or the holders of the individual\nbonds, respectively, have the right to tender\ntheir interests for purchase by the Firm on\nspecified dates at a specified price. The Firm\noften may have recourse to the underlying\nassets held by the SPEs in the event payments\nare required under such liquidity facilities,\nas well as make-whole or recourse provisions\nwith the trust sponsors. The recourse amount\noften exceeds the maximum potential payout\namount of the guarantee. Substantially all of\nthe underlying assets in the SPEs are\ninvestment grade. Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond\ntrusts are classified as derivatives. Whole\nLoan Sales Guarantees. The Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain whole loan sales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the Firm may be required to\nrepurchase such assets or make other payments\nrelated to such assets if such representations\nand warranties are breached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential payout related to such\nrepresentations and warranties is equal to the\ncurrent UPB of such loans. Since the Firm no\nlonger services these loans, it has no\ninformation on the current UPB of those loans,\nand, accordingly, the amount included in the\nprevious table represents the UPB at the time\nof the whole loan sale or at the time when the\nFirm last serviced any of those loans. The\ncurrent UPB balances could be substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout amount\nincluded in the previous table. The related\nliability primarily relates to sales of loans\nto the federal mortgage agencies.\nSecuritization Representations and Warranties.\nAs part of the Firm\u2019s Institutional Securities\nbusiness segment\u2019s securitizations and related\nactivities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain assets transferred in securitization\ntransactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent\nand nature of the representations and\nwarranties, if any, vary among different\nsecuritizations. Under certain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be required to repurchase certain\nassets or make other payments related to such\nassets if such representations and warranties\nare breached. The maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments the Firm could be required to\nmake would be equal to the current outstanding\nbalances of, or losses associated with, the\nassets subject to breaches of such\nrepresentations and warranties. The amount\nincluded in the previous table for the maximum\npotential payout includes the current UPB or\nhistorical losses where known and the UPB at\nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not\nknown. General Partner Guarantees. As a\ngeneral partner in certain investment\nmanagement funds, the Firm receives certain\ndistributions from the partnerships when the\nreturn exceeds specified performance targets\naccording to the provisions of the partnership\nagreements. The Firm may be required to return\nall or a portion of such distributions to the\nlimited partners in the event the limited\npartners do not achieve a certain return as\nspecified in the various partnership\nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees. The Firm is a\nsponsoring member of the Government Securities\nDivision of the FICC's Sponsored Clearing\nModel. Clients of the Firm, as sponsored\nmembers, can transact in overnight and term\nsecurities repurchase and resale agreements,\nwhich are cleared through the FICC. As\nsponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the\nFICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its clients\u2019 obligations. In\n2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing model was\nupdated such that the Firm could be\nresponsible for liquidation of a sponsored\nmember\u2019s account and guarantees any resulting\nloss to the FICC in the event the sponsored\nmember fails to fully pay any net liquidation\namount due from the sponsored member to the\nFICC. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum\npotential payout amount reflects the total of\nthe estimated net liquidation amounts for\nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes\ncredit exposure under this guarantee by\nobtaining a security interest in its sponsored\nmember clients\u2019 collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member\ntransactions. Therefore, the Firm's exposure\nis estimated to be an amount substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout\namount. The collateral amount in which the\nFirm has a security interest is approximately\nequal to the maximum potential payout amount\nof the guarantee. Other Guarantees and\nIndemnities In the normal course of business,\nthe Firm provides guarantees and\nindemnifications in a variety of transactions.\nThese provisions generally are standard\ncontractual terms. Certain of these guarantees\nand indemnifications are described below: \u2022\nIndemnities . The Firm provides standard\nindemnities to counterparties for certain\ncontingent exposures and taxes, including U.S.\nand foreign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities\nand stock lending transactions, certain\nannuity products and other financial\narrangements. These indemnity payments could\nbe required based on a change in the tax laws,\na change in interpretation of applicable tax\nrulings or a change in factual circumstances.\nCertain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Firm could be\n                                  \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    116  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nrequired to make under\nthese indemnifications\ncannot be estimated. \u2022\nExchange/Clearinghouse\nMember Guarantees. The\nFirm is a member of\nvarious exchanges and\nclearinghouses that\ntrade and clear\nsecurities and/or\nderivative contracts.\nAssociated with its\nmembership, the Firm\nmay be required to pay\na certain amount as\ndetermined by the\nexchange or the\nclearinghouse in case\nof a default of any of\nits members or pay a\nproportionate share of\nthe financial\nobligations of another\nmember that may\ndefault on its\nobligations to the\nexchange or the\nclearinghouse. While\nthe rules governing\ndifferent exchange or\nclearinghouse\nmemberships and the\nforms of these\nguarantees may vary,\nin general the Firm\u2019s\nobligations under\nthese rules would\narise only if the\nexchange or\nclearinghouse had\npreviously exhausted\nits resources. In\naddition, some\nclearinghouse rules\nrequire members to\nassume a proportionate\nshare of losses\nresulting from the\nclearinghouse\u2019s\ninvestment of\nguarantee fund\ncontributions and\ninitial margin and of\nother losses unrelated\nto the default of a\nclearing member, if\nsuch losses exceed the\nspecified resources\nallocated for such\npurpose by the\nclearinghouse. The\nmaximum potential\npayout under these\nrules cannot be\nestimated. The Firm\nhas not recorded any\ncontingent liability\nin its financial\nstatements for these\nagreements and\nbelieves that any\npotential requirement\nto make payments under\nthese agreements is\nremote. \u2022 Merger and\nAcquisition\nGuarantees. The Firm\nmay, from time to\ntime, in its role as\ninvestment banking\nadvisor be required to\nprovide guarantees in\nconnection with\ncertain European\nmerger and acquisition\ntransactions. If\nrequired by the\nregulating\nauthorities, the Firm\nprovides a guarantee\nthat the acquirer in\nthe transaction has or\nwill have sufficient\nfunds to complete the\ntransaction and would\nthen be required to\nmake the acquisition\npayments in the event\nthe acquirer\u2019s funds\nare insufficient at\nthe completion date of\nthe transaction. These\narrangements generally\ncover the time frame\nfrom the transaction\noffer date to its\nclosing date and,\ntherefore, are\ngenerally short term\nin nature. The Firm\nbelieves the\nlikelihood of any\npayment by the Firm\nunder these\narrangements is remote\ngiven the level of its\ndue diligence in its\nrole as investment\nbanking advisor. In\naddition, in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, the Firm\nguarantees the debt\nand/or certain trading\nobligations (including\nobligations associated\nwith derivatives,\nforeign exchange\ncontracts and the\nsettlement of physical\ncommodities) of\ncertain subsidiaries.\nThese guarantees\ngenerally are entity\nor product specific\nand are required by\ninvestors or trading\ncounterparties. The\nactivities of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries\ncovered by these\nguarantees (including\nany related debt or\ntrading obligations)\nare included in the\nfinancial statements.\n\nContingencies Legal In\naddition to the\nmatters described in\nthe following\nparagraphs, in the\nnormal course of\nbusiness, the Firm has\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with its\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress. These\nactions have included,\nbut are not limited\nto, antitrust, false\nclaims act,\nresidential mortgage\nand credit crisis-\nrelated matters. While\nthe Firm has\nidentified below any\nindividual proceedings\nwhere the Firm\nbelieves a material\nloss to be reasonably\npossible and\nreasonably estimable,\nthere can be no\nassurance that\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nthose where potential\nlosses have not yet\nbeen determined to be\nprobable or possible\nand reasonably\nestimable. The Firm\ncontests liability\nand/or the amount of\ndamages as appropriate\nin each pending\nmatter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions        2021       2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Legal        $   157    $   336    $   221  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s legal\nexpenses can, and may\nin the future,\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm. In many\nproceedings and\ninvestigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss, or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss, can be\nreasonably estimated\nfor a proceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor\n                                  \n  117    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nunsettled legal questions relevant to the\nproceedings or investigations in question. For\ncertain other legal proceedings and\ninvestigations, the Firm can estimate\nreasonably possible losses, additional losses,\nranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued but does not\nbelieve, based on current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel, that such losses\ncould have a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s financial statements as a whole, other\nthan the matters referred to in the following\nparagraphs. On September 23, 2014, Financial\nGuaranty Insurance Company (\u201cFGIC\u201d) filed a\ncomplaint against the Firm in the Supreme\nCourt of the State of New York County\n(\u201cSupreme Court of NY\u201d) styled Financial\nGuaranty Insurance Company v. Morgan Stanley\nABS Capital I Inc. et al . relating to the\nMorgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust\n2007-NC4. The complaint asserts claims for\nbreach of contract and fraudulent inducement\nand alleges, among other things, that the\nloans in the trust breached various\nrepresentations and warranties and that\ndefendants made untrue statements and material\nomissions to induce FGIC to issue a financial\nguaranty policy on certain classes of\ncertificates that had an original balance of\napproximately $ 876million. The complaint\nseeks, among other relief, specific\nperformance of the loan breach remedy\nprocedures in the transaction documents,\ncompensatory, consequential and punitive\ndamages, attorneys\u2019 fees, interest and costs.\nOn January 23, 2017, the court denied the\nFirm\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. On\nSeptember 13, 2018, the Appellate Division,\nFirst Department (\u201cFirst Department\u201d) affirmed\nin part and reversed in part the lower court\u2019s\norder denying the Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. On December 20, 2018, the First\nDepartment denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave\nto appeal to the New York Court of Appeals\n(\u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d) or, in the alternative,\nfor re-argument. On July 30, 2021, the Firm\nfiled a motion for summary judgment. On\nFebruary 4, 2022, the parties entered into a\nconfidential settlement agreement, which is\nconditioned on consummation of the Firm\u2019s\nagreement to settle Deutsche Bank National\nTrust Company solely in its capacity as\nTrustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I\nInc. Trust 2007-NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage\nCapital Holdings LLC as Successor-by-Merger to\nMorgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc., and\nMorgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Based on\ncurrently available information, the Firm\nbelieves that it could incur a loss in this\naction of up to approximately $ 277million,\nthe total original unpaid balance of the\nmortgage loans for which the Firm received\nrepurchase demands from a certificate holder\nand FGIC that the Firm did not repurchase,\nplus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees\nand costs, as well as claim payments that FGIC\nhas made and will make in the future. In\naddition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the\nnumber of loans at issue and the possible\nrange of loss could increase. On January 23,\n2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in\nits capacity as trustee, filed a complaint\nagainst the Firm styled Deutsche Bank National\nTrust Company solely in its capacity as\nTrustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I\nInc. Trust 2007-NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage\nCapital Holdings LLC as Successor-by-Merger to\nMorgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc., and\nMorgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. , pending in\nthe Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts\nclaims for breach of contract and alleges,\namong other things, that the loans in the\ntrust, which had an original principal balance\nof approximately $ 1.05billion, breached\nvarious representations and warranties. The\ncomplaint seeks, among other relief, specific\nperformance of the loan breach remedy\nprocedures in the transaction documents,\ncompensatory, consequential, rescissory,\nequitable and punitive damages, attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs and other related expenses, and\ninterest. On December 11, 2015, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part the Firm\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the complaint. On October\n19, 2018, the court granted the Firm\u2019s motion\nfor leave to amend its answer and to stay the\ncase pending resolution of Deutsche Bank\nNational Trust Company\u2019s appeal to the Court\nof Appeals in another case, styled Deutsche\nBank National Trust Company v. Barclays Bank\nPLC , regarding the applicable statute of\nlimitations. On January 17, 2019, the First\nDepartment reversed the trial court\u2019s order to\nthe extent that it had granted in part the\nFirm\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. On\nJune 4, 2019, the First Department granted the\nFirm\u2019s motion for leave to appeal its January\n17, 2019 decision to the Court of Appeals. On\nMarch 19, 2020, the Firm filed a motion for\npartial summary judgment. On December 22,\n2020, the Court of Appeals reversed the First\nDepartment and reinstated the trial court's\norder to the extent it had granted in part the\nFirm's motion to dismiss the complaint. On\nFebruary 4, 2022, the parties entered into an\nagreement to settle the litigation, which is\nconditioned on approval by either\ncertificateholders in a consent solicitation\nor a court in a trust instructional\nproceeding. Based on currently available\ninformation, the Firm believes that it could\nincur a loss in this action of up to\napproximately $ 277million, the total original\nunpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which\nthe Firm received repurchase demands from a\ncertificate holder and a monoline insurer that\nthe Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and\npost-judgment interest, fees and costs, but\nplaintiff is seeking to expand the number of\nloans at issue and the possible range of loss\ncould increase. Tax In matters styled Case\nnumber 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the\nDutch Tax Authority (\u201cDutch Authority\u201d) is\nchallenging in the Dutch courts the prior set-\noff by the Firm of approximately \u20ac 124million\n(approximately $ 141million) plus accrued\ninterest of withholding tax credits against\nthe Firm\u2019s corporation tax liabilities for the\ntax years 2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority\nalleges that the Firm was not entitled to\nreceive the withholding tax credits on the\nbasis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did\nnot hold legal title to certain securities\nsubject to withholding tax on the relevant\ndates. The Dutch Authority has also alleged\nthat the Firm failed to provide certain\ninformation to the Dutch Authority and to keep\nadequate books and records. On April 26, 2018,\n                                  \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    118  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthe District Court in Amsterdam issued a\ndecision dismissing the Dutch Authority\u2019s\nclaims with respect to certain of the tax\nyears in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court\nof Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch\nAuthority\u2019s appeal in matters re-styled Case\nnumber 18/00318 and Case number 18/00319 . On\nJune 22, 2020, the Firm filed an appeal\nagainst the decision of the Court of Appeal in\nAmsterdam before the Dutch High Court. On\nJanuary 29, 2021, the Advocate General of the\nDutch High Court issued an advisory opinion on\nthe Firm\u2019s appeal, which rejected the Firm\u2019s\nprincipal grounds of appeal. On February 11,\n2021, the Firm and the Dutch Authority each\nresponded to this opinio n. On June 22, 2021,\nDutch criminal authorities sought various\ndocuments in connection with an investigation\nof the Firm related to the civil claims\nasserted by the Dutch Authority concerning the\naccuracy of the Firm subsidiary\u2019s tax returns\nand the maintenance of its books and records\nfor 2007 to 2012. 16. Variable Interest\nEntities and Securitization Activities\nOverview The Firm is involved with various\nSPEs in the normal course of business. In most\ncases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\nThe Firm\u2019s variable interests in VIEs include\ndebt and equity interests, commitments,\nguarantees, derivative instruments and certain\nfees. The Firm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises\nprimarily from: \u2022 Interests purchased in\nconnection with market-making activities,\nsecurities held in its Investment securities\nportfolio and retained interests held as a\nresult of securitization activities, including\nre-securitization transactions. \u2022 Guarantees\nissued and residual interests retained in\nconnection with municipal bond\nsecuritizations. \u2022 Loans made to and\ninvestments in VIEs that hold debt, equity,\nreal estate or other assets. \u2022 Derivatives\nentered into with VIEs. \u2022 Structuring of CLNs\nor other asset-repackaging notes designed to\nmeet the investment objectives of clients. \u2022\nOther structured transactions designed to\nprovide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or\nits clients. The Firm determines whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its\ninitial involvement with the VIE and\nreassesses whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it\nhas any continuing involvement with the VIE.\nThis determination is based upon an analysis\nof the design of the VIE, including the VIE\u2019s\nstructure and activities, the power to make\nsignificant economic decisions held by the\nFirm and by other parties, and the variable\ninterests owned by the Firm and other parties.\nThe power to make the most significant\neconomic decisions may take a number of\ndifferent forms in different types of\nVIEs. The Firm\nconsiders servicing or\ncollateral management\ndecisions as\nrepresenting the power\nto make the most\nsignificant economic\ndecisions in\ntransactions such as\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs. As a result, the\nFirm does not\nconsolidate\nsecuritizations or\nCDOs for which it does\nnot act as the\nservicer or collateral\nmanager unless it\nholds certain other\nrights to replace the\nservicer or collateral\nmanager or to require\nthe liquidation of the\nentity. If the Firm\nserves as servicer or\ncollateral manager, or\nhas certain other\nrights described in\nthe previous sentence,\nthe Firm analyzes the\ninterests in the VIE\nthat it holds and\nconsolidates only\nthose VIEs for which\nit holds a potentially\nsignificant interest\nin the VIE.\n\nFor many transactions,\nsuch as re-\nsecuritization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes,\nthere are no\nsignificant economic\ndecisions made on an\nongoing basis. In\nthese cases, the Firm\nfocuses its analysis\non decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing of the\ntransaction and at the\ntermination of the\ntransaction. The Firm\nconcluded in most of\nthese transactions\nthat decisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing were shared\nbetween the Firm and\nthe initial investors\nbased upon the nature\nof the assets,\nincluding whether the\nassets were issued in\na transaction\nsponsored by the Firm\nand the extent of the\ninformation available\nto the Firm and to\ninvestors, the number,\nnature and involvement\nof investors, other\nrights held by the\nFirm and investors,\nthe standardization of\nthe legal\ndocumentation and the\nlevel of continuing\ninvolvement by the\nFirm, including the\namount and type of\ninterests owned by the\nFirm and by other\ninvestors. The Firm\nfocused its control\ndecision on any right\nheld by the Firm or\ninvestors related to\nthe termination of the\nVIE. Most re-\nsecuritization\ntransactions, CLNs and\nother asset-\nrepackaging notes have\nno such termination\nrights.\nConsolidated VIE\nAssets and Liabilities\nby Type of Activity 1\n                                              \n            At                  At            \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  $        VIE       VIE       VIE       VIE  \n  in       As\u2026       Li\u2026       As\u2026       Li\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                          \n  M\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  409    $  590    $   17  \n  I\u2026       717       294       776       355  \n  v\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       508        39       504        39  \n  e\u2026                                          \n  O\u2026       510       286       248         3  \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  414  \n                                              \n1.

The purchase of the\ntransferred assets by the SPE is financed\nthrough the sale of these interests. In many\nsecuritization transactions involving\ncommercial mortgage loans, the Firm transfers\na portion of the assets to the SPE with\nunrelated parties transferring the remaining\nassets. In addition, mainly in securitization\ntransactions involving residential mortgage\nloans, the Firm may also enter into derivative\ntransactions, primarily interest rate swaps or\ninterest rate caps, with the SPE. Although not\nobligated, the Firm generally makes a market\nin the securities issued by SPEs in\nsecuritization transactions. As a market\nmaker, the Firm offers to buy these securities\nfrom, and sell these securities to, investors.\nSecurities purchased through these market-\nmaking activities are not considered to be\nretained interests; these beneficial interests\ngenerally are included in Trading\nassets\u2014Corporate and other debt and are\nmeasured at fair value. The Firm enters into\nderivatives, generally interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate caps, with a senior payment\npriority in many securitization transactions.\nThe risks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas similar derivatives with non-SPE\ncounterparties and are managed as part of the\nFirm\u2019s overall exposure. See Note 7 for\nfurther information on derivative instruments\nand hedging activities. Investment Securities\nThe Firm holds securities issued by VIEs\nwithin the Investment securities portfolio.\nThese securities are composed of those related\nto transactions sponsored by the federal\nmortgage agencies and predominantly the most\nsenior securities issued by VIEs backed by\nstudent loans and commercial mortgage loans.\nTransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies include an explicit or implicit\nguarantee provided by the U.S. government.\nAdditionally, the Firm holds certain\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities issued\nby VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's\nsecuritization activities. See Note 8 for\nfurther information on the Investment\nsecurities portfolio. Municipal Tender Option\nBond Trusts In a municipal tender option bond\ntrust transaction, the client transfers a\nmunicipal bond to a trust. The trust issues\nshort-term securities that the Firm, as the\nremarketing agent, sells to investors. The\nclient generally retains a residual interest.\nThe short-term securities are supported by a\nliquidity facility pursuant to which the\ninvestors may put their short-term interests.\nIn most programs, a third-party provider will\nprovide such liquidity facility; in some\nprograms, the Firm provides this liquidity\nfacility. The Firm may, in lieu of purchasing\nshort-term securities for remarketing, decide\nto extend a temporary loan to the trust. The\nclient can generally terminate the transaction\nat any time. The liquidity provider can\ngenerally terminate the transaction upon the\noccurrence of certain events. When the\ntransaction is terminated, the municipal bond\nis generally sold or returned to the client.\nAny losses suffered by the liquidity provider\nupon the sale of the bond are the\nresponsibility of the client. This obligation\nis generally collateralized. Liquidity\nfacilities provided to municipal tender option\nbond trusts are classified as derivatives. The\nFirm consolidates any municipal tender option\nbond trusts in which it holds the residual\ninterest. Credit Protection Purchased through\nCredit-Linked Notes CLN transactions are\ndesigned to provide investors with exposure to\ncertain credit risk on referenced assets. In\nthese transactions, the Firm transfers assets\n(generally high-quality securities or money\nmarket investments) to an SPE, enters into a\nderivative transaction in which the SPE sells\nprotection on an unrelated referenced asset or\ngroup of assets, through a credit derivative,\nand sells the securities issued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may\nalso enter into interest rate or currency\nswaps with the SPE. Depending on the\nstructure, the assets and liabilities of the\nSPE may be consolidated and recognized in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or accounted for as a\nsale of assets. Upon the occurrence of a\ncredit event related to the referenced asset,\nthe SPE will deliver securities collateral as\npayment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to\nchanges in the collateral\u2019s value. Derivative\npayments by the SPE are collateralized. The\nrisks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas those with non-SPE counterparties and are\nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall\nexposure. Other Structured Financings The Firm\ninvests in interests issued by entities that\ndevelop and own low-income communities\n(including low-income housing projects) and\nentities that construct and own facilities\nthat will generate energy from renewable\nresources. The interests entitle the Firm to a\nshare of tax credits and tax losses generated\nby these projects. In addition, the Firm has\nissued guarantees to investors in certain low-\nincome housing funds. The guarantees are\ndesigned to return an investor\u2019s contribution\nto a fund and the investor\u2019s share of tax\nlosses and tax credits expected to be\ngenerated by the fund. The Firm is also\ninvolved with entities designed to provide\ntax-efficient yields to the Firm or its\nclients. Collateralized Loan and Debt\nObligations CLOs and CDOs are SPEs that\npurchase a pool of assets consisting of\ncorporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or\n                                  \n  121    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nsynthetic exposures on\nsimilar assets through\nderivatives and issue\nmultiple tranches of\ndebt and equity\nsecurities to\ninvestors. The Firm\nunderwrites the\nsecurities issued in\ncertain CLO\ntransactions on behalf\nof unaffiliated\nsponsors and provides\nadvisory services to\nthese unaffiliated\nsponsors. The Firm\nsells corporate loans\nto many of these SPEs,\nin some cases\nrepresenting a\nsignificant portion of\nthe total assets\npurchased. Although\nnot obligated, the\nFirm generally makes a\nmarket in the\nsecurities issued by\nSPEs in these\ntransactions and may\nretain unsold\nsecurities. These\nbeneficial interests\nare included in\nTrading assets and are\nmeasured at fair\nvalue. Equity-Linked\nNotes ELN transactions\nare designed to\nprovide investors with\nexposure to certain\nrisks related to the\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index. In an\nELN transaction, the\nFirm typically\ntransfers to an SPE\neither a note issued\nby the Firm, the\npayments on which are\nlinked to the\nperformance of a\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index, or\ndebt securities issued\nby other companies and\na derivative contract,\nthe terms of which\nwill relate to the\nperformance of a\nspecific equity\nsecurity, equity index\nor other index. These\nELN transactions with\nSPEs were not\nconsolidated at\nDecember 31, 2021 or\nDecember 31, 2020.\nTransferred Assets with Continuing Involvement\n                                              \n

Regulatory\nRequirements\nRegulatory Capital\nFramework The Firm is\nan FHC under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of\n1956, as amended, and\nis subject to the\nregulation and\noversight of the Board\nof Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d).\nThe Federal Reserve\nestablishes capital\nrequirements for the\nFirm, including \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d\nstandards, and\nevaluates the Firm\u2019s\ncompliance with such\ncapital requirements.\nThe OCC establishes\nsimilar capital\nrequirements and\nstandards for the\nFirm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries,\nincluding, among\nothers, MSBNA and\nMSPBNA. The regulatory\ncapital requirements\nare largely based on\nthe Basel III capital\nstandards established\nby the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct. In addition, many\nof the Firm\u2019s\nregulated subsidiaries\nare subject to\nregulatory capital\nrequirements,\nincluding regulated\nsubsidiaries\nprovisionally\nregistered as swap\ndealers with the CFTC\nor conditionally\nregistered as\nsecurity-based swap\ndealers with the SEC\nor registered as\nbroker-dealers or\nfutures commission\nmerchants. Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\nThe Firm is required\nto maintain minimum\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nratios under\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. A\nsummary of the\ncalculations of\nregulatory capital and\nRWA follows. Risk-\nBased Regulatory\nCapital. Risk-based\ncapital ratio\nrequirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier 1\ncapital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital (which\nincludes Tier 2\ncapital), each as a\npercentage of RWA, and\nconsist of regulatory\nminimum required\nratios plus the Firm\u2019s\ncapital buffer\nrequirement. Capital\nrequirements require\ncertain adjustments\nto, and\ndeductions from,\ncapital for purposes\nof determining these\nratios.\n\nCECL Deferral.

The Firm early adopted the Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty Credit Risk (\u201cSA-\nCCR\u201d) on December 1, 2021. SA-CCR replaced the\ncurrent exposure method used to measure\nderivatives counterparty exposure within the\nStandardized Approach RWA and Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio exposure calculations. As a\nresult of the adoption, as of December 31,\n2021, the Firm's risk-weighted assets under\nthe Standardized Approach increased by $25\nbillion, and the Firm's Standardized Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital ratio decreased by 90\nbasis points.\n\n3. Adjusted average assets represents the\ndenominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and\nis composed of the average daily balance of\nconsolidated on-balance sheet assets for the\nquarters ending on the respective balance\nsheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill,\nintangible assets, investments in covered\nfunds, defined benefit pension plan assets,\nafter-tax gain on sale from assets sold into\nsecuritizations, investments in the Firm\u2019s own\ncapital instruments, certain defined tax\nassets and other capital deductions.\n\n4. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum\nof Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1\nleverage ratio and other adjustments,\nprimarily: (i) for derivatives, potential\nfuture exposure and the effective notional\nprincipal amount of sold credit protection,\noffset by qualifying purchased credit\nprotection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk\nfor repo-style transactions; and (iii) the\ncredit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet\nexposures.\n\n5. The Firm\u2019s SLR and Supplementary leverage\nexposure as of December 31, 2020 reflect the\nexclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve Banks based on a\nFederal Reserve interim final rule that was in\neffect until March 31, 2021.\nCertain U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries\u2019\nRegulatory Capital and\nCapital Ratios The OCC\nestablishes capital\nrequirements for the\nFirm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries, which as\nof December 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020\ninclude, among others,\nMorgan Stanley Bank,\nN.A.

The U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nassets represent 86%\nof the Firm\u2019s total\npension plan assets.\nThe U.S. Qualified\nPlan uses a\ncombination of active\nand risk-controlled\nfixed income\ninvestment strategies.\nThe fixed income asset\nallocation consists\nprimarily of fixed\nincome securities and\nrelated derivative\ninstruments designed\nto approximate the\nexpected cash flows of\nthe plan\u2019s liabilities\nin order to help\nreduce plan exposure\nto interest rate\nvariation and to\nbetter align assets\nwith the obligation.\nThe longer-duration\nfixed income\nallocation is expected\nto help protect the\nplan\u2019s funded status\nand maintain the\nstability of plan\ncontributions over the\nlong run. The\ninvestment portfolio\nperformance is\nassessed by comparing\nactual investment\nperformance with\nchanges in the\nestimated present\nvalue of the U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nbenefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments\nare permitted in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio\nonly to the extent\nthat they comply with\nall of the plan\u2019s\ninvestment policy\nguidelines and are\nconsistent with the\nplan\u2019s risk and return\nobjectives.

This includes\npercentage allocations\nand credit quality.\nDerivatives are used\nsolely for the purpose\nof enhancing\n                                  \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    132  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ninvestment returns in\nthe underlying assets\nand not to circumvent\nportfolio\nrestrictions. Plan\nassets are measured at\nfair value using\nvaluation techniques\nthat are consistent\nwith the valuation\ntechniques applied to\nthe Firm\u2019s major\ncategories of assets\nand liabilities as\ndescribed in Notes 2\nand 5. OTC derivative\ncontracts consist of\ninvestments in\ninterest rate swaps\nand total return\nswaps. Other\ninvestments consist of\ninsurance contracts\nheld by non-U.S.-based\nplans. The insurance\ncontracts are valued\nbased on the premium\nreserve of the insurer\nfor a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given\nto the employee\nbenefit plan that\napproximates fair\nvalue. The insurance\ncontracts are\ncategorized in Level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nprivately offered\nfunds regulated,\nsupervised and subject\nto periodic\nexamination by a U.S.\nfederal or state\nagency and available\nto institutional\nclients. The trust\nmust be maintained for\nthe collective\ninvestment or\nreinvestment of assets\ncontributed to it from\nU.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans\nmaintained by more\nthan one employer or\ncontrolled group of\ncorporations. The\nsponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds\nvalues the funds based\non the fair value of\nthe underlying\nsecurities. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nredeemable at NAV at\nthe measurement date\nor in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based\nplans hold foreign\nfunds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed\nincome funds, target\ncash flow funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed\nincome funds invest in\nindividual securities\nquoted on a recognized\nstock exchange or\ntraded in a regulated\nmarket. Certain fixed\nincome funds aim to\nproduce returns\nconsistent with\ncertain Financial\nTimes Stock Exchange\nindexes.

The\nParent Company has\nissued guarantees on\nbehalf of its\nsubsidiaries to\nvarious U.S. and\nnon-U.S. exchanges and\nclearinghouses that\ntrade and clear\nsecurities and/or\nfutures contracts.\nUnder these guarantee\narrangements, the\nParent Company may be\nrequired to pay the\nfinancial obligations\nof its subsidiaries\nrelated to business\ntransacted on or with\nthe exchanges and\nclearinghouses in the\nevent of a\nsubsidiary\u2019s default\non its obligations to\nthe exchange or the\nclearinghouse.

These\nindemnity payments\ncould be required, as\napplicable, based on a\nchange in the tax\nlaws, change in\ninterpretation of\napplicable tax rulings\nor claims arising from\ncontractual\nrelationships between\naffiliates.

Based\non this evaluation,\nthe Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief\nFinancial Officer\nconcluded that the\nFirm\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and\nprocedures were\neffective as of the\nend of the period\ncovered by this annual\nreport.\n\nManagement\u2019s Report on\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nThe Firm\u2019s management\nis responsible for\nestablishing and\nmaintaining adequate\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nThe Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting is designed\nto provide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nthe reliability of\nfinancial reporting\nand the preparation of\nfinancial statements\nfor external purposes\nin accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles\nin the United States\nof America (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d).\n\nThe internal control\nover financial\nreporting includes\nthose policies and\nprocedures that:\n\n\u2022 Pertain to the\nmaintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the\nassets of the Firm;\n\n\u2022 Provide reasonable\nassurance that\ntransactions are\nrecorded as necessary\nto permit preparation\nof financial\nstatements in\naccordance with U.S.\nGAAP and that receipts\nand expenditures are\nbeing made only in\naccordance with\nauthorizations of the\nFirm\u2019s management and\ndirectors; and\n\n\u2022 Provide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nprevention or timely\ndetection of\nunauthorized\nacquisition, use or\ndisposition of Firm\nassets that could have\na material effect on\nthe Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements.\n\nBecause of its\ninherent limitations,\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nmay not prevent or\ndetect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of\nany evaluation of\neffectiveness to\nfuture periods are\nsubject to the risk\nthat controls may\nbecome inadequate\nbecause of changes in\nconditions or that the\ndegree of compliance\nwith the policies or\nprocedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed\nthe effectiveness of\nthe Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021. In\nmaking this\nassessment, management\nused the criteria set\nforth by the Committee\nof Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated\nFramework (2013).\nBased on management\u2019s\nassessment and those\ncriteria, management\nbelieves that the Firm\nmaintained effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as\nof December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s independent\nregistered public\naccounting firm has\naudited and issued a\nreport on the Firm\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\nwhich appears below.\n                                  \n  143    December 2021 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n   Report of Independent Registered Public    \n               Accounting Firm                \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Morgan Stanley:\n                                              \n   Opinion on Internal Control over           \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nWe have audited the\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting of\nMorgan Stanley and\nsubsidiaries (the\n\u201cFirm\u201d) as of December\n31, 2021, based on\ncriteria established\nin Internal Control \u2014\nIntegrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the\nCommittee of\nSponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(COSO). In our\nopinion, the Firm\nmaintained, in all\nmaterial respects,\neffective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021,\nbased on criteria\nestablished in\nInternal Control \u2014\nIntegrated Framework\n(2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited,\nin accordance with the\nstandards of the\nPublic Company\nAccounting Oversight\nBoard (United States)\n(PCAOB), the financial\nstatements of the Firm\nas of and for the year\nended December 31,\n2021 and our report\ndated February 24,\n2022 expressed an\nunqualified opinion on\nthose financial\nstatements.\n                                              \n  Basis for Opinion                           \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s management\nis responsible for\nmaintaining effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nand for its assessment\nof the effectiveness\nof internal control\nover financial\nreporting, included in\nthe accompanying\nManagement\u2019s Report on\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is\nto express an opinion\non the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting based on our\naudit.

Those standards\nrequire that we plan\nand perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable\nassurance about\nwhether effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nwas maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our\naudit included\nobtaining an\nunderstanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\n\nassessing the risk\nthat a material\nweakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating\nthe design and\noperating\neffectiveness of\ninternal control based\non the assessed risk,\nand performing such\nother procedures as we\nconsidered necessary\nin the circumstances.\nWe believe that our\naudit provides a\nreasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\nDefinition and\nLimitations of\nInternal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting is a process\ndesigned to provide\nreasonable assurance\nregarding the\nreliability of\nfinancial reporting\nand the preparation of\nfinancial statements\nfor external purposes\nin accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles.\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes\nthose policies and\nprocedures that (1)\npertain to the\nmaintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the\nassets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable\nassurance that\ntransactions are\nrecorded as necessary\nto permit preparation\nof financial\nstatements in\naccordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles,\nand that receipts and\nexpenditures of the\ncompany are being made\nonly in accordance\nwith authorizations of\nmanagement and\ndirectors of the\ncompany; and (3)\nprovide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nprevention or timely\ndetection of\nunauthorized\nacquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material\neffect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its\ninherent limitations,\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nmay not prevent or\ndetect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of\nany evaluation of\neffectiveness to\nfuture periods are\nsubject to the risk\nthat controls may\nbecome inadequate\nbecause of changes in\nconditions, or that\nthe degree of\ncompliance with the\npolicies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nLLP\nNew York, New York\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n                                  \n  December 2021 Form 10-K    144  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                                              \n   Changes in Internal Control Over           \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nNo change in the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting (as such\nterm is defined in\nExchange Act Rule\n13a-15(f)) occurred\nduring the quarter\nended December 31,\n2021 that materially\naffected, or is\nreasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting.\n                                              \n  Other Information                           \n                                              \nNone.\n\nDisclosure Regarding\nForeign Jurisdictions\nthat Prevent\nInspections\nNot applicable.\n                                              \n  Unresolved Staff Comments                   \n                                              \nThe Firm, like other\nwell-known seasoned\nissuers, from time to\ntime receives written\ncomments from the\nstaff of the SEC\nregarding its periodic\nor current reports\nunder the Exchange\nAct.

In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress.\n\nThe Firm is also\ninvolved, from time to\ntime, in other\nreviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding the\nFirm\u2019s business, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales and\ntrading activities,\nfinancial products or\nofferings\n\nsponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, and\naccounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions\nor other relief.\n\nThe Firm contests\nliability and/or the\namount of damages as\nappropriate in each\npending matter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\nThe Firm\u2019s future\nlegal expenses may\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. The Firm\ncannot predict with\ncertainty if, how or\nwhen such proceedings\nor investigations will\nbe resolved or what\nthe eventual\nsettlement, fine,\npenalty or other\nrelief, if any, may\nbe, particularly for\nproceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and\nconsideration of novel\nor unsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. Subject to\nthe foregoing, the\nFirm believes, based\non current knowledge\nand after consultation\nwith counsel, that the\noutcome of such\nproceedings and\ninvestigations will\nnot have a material\nadverse effect on the\nfinancial condition of\nthe Firm, although the\noutcome of such\nproceedings or\ninvestigations could\nbe material to the\nFirm\u2019s operating\nresults and cash flows\nfor a particular\nperiod depending on,\namong other things,\nthe level of the\nFirm\u2019s revenues or\nincome for such\nperiod.\n\nWhile the Firm has\nidentified below\ncertain proceedings\nthat the Firm believes\nto be material,\nindividually or\ncollectively, there\ncan be no assurance\nthat additional\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nare not yet determined\nto be material.\n                                              \n  Residential Mortgage Related Matters        \n                                              \nOn May 17, 2013, the\nplaintiff in IKB\nInternational S.A. in\nLiquidation, et al. v.\nMorgan Stanley, et al\n. filed a complaint\nagainst the Firm and\ncertain affiliates in\nthe Supreme Court of\nthe State of New York\nCounty (\u201cSupreme Court\nof NY\u201d).
