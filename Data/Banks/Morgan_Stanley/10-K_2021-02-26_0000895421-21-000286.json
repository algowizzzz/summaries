The\nFederal Reserve has\nauthority to examine,\nprescribe regulations\nand take action with\nrespect to all of our\nsubsidiaries. In\nparticular, we are\nsubject to (among\nother\n\nthings): significantly\nrevised and expanded\nregulation and\nsupervision; intensive\nscrutiny of our\nbusinesses and plans\nfor expansion of those\nbusinesses;\nlimitations on\nactivities; a systemic\nrisk regime that\nimposes heightened\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements;\nrestrictions on\nactivities and\ninvestments imposed by\na section of the BHC\nAct added by the Dodd-\nFrank Act referred to\nas the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d;\nand comprehensive\nderivatives\nregulation.

The BHC\nAct limits the\nactivities of BHCs and\nFHCs and grants the\nFederal Reserve\nauthority to limit our\nability to conduct\nactivities. We must\nobtain the Federal\nReserve\u2019s approval\nbefore engaging in\ncertain banking and\nother financial\nactivities both in the\nU.S. and\ninternationally.\n\nThe BHC Act\ngrandfathers\n\u201cactivities related to\nthe trading, sale or\ninvestment in\ncommodities and\nunderlying physical\nproperties,\u201d provided\nthat we were engaged\nin \u201cany of such\nactivities as of\nSeptember 30, 1997 in\nthe U.S.\u201d and provided\nthat certain other\nconditions that are\nwithin our reasonable\ncontrol are satisfied.\nWe currently engage in\nour commodities\nactivities pursuant to\nthe BHC Act\ngrandfather exemption\nas well as other\nauthorities under the\nBHC Act.\n\nActivities\nRestrictions under the\nVolcker Rule. The\nVolcker Rule prohibits\nbanking entities,\nincluding us and our\naffiliates, from\nengaging in certain\nproprietary trading\nactivities, as defined\nin the Volcker Rule,\nsubject to exemptions\nfor underwriting,\nmarket-making-related\nactivities, risk-\nmitigating hedging and\ncertain other\nactivities. The\nVolcker Rule also\nprohibits certain\ninvestments and\nrelationships by\nbanking entities with\ncovered funds, as\ndefined in the Volcker\nRule, with a number of\nexemptions and\nexclusions. The\nVolcker Rule also\nrequires that\ndeductions be made\nfrom a BHC\u2019s Tier 1\ncapital for\npermissible\ninvestments in certain\ncovered funds. In\naddition, the Volcker\nRule requires banking\nentities to have\ncomprehensive\ncompliance programs\nreasonably designed to\nensure and monitor\ncompliance with the\nVolcker Rule. We have\nbrought all of our\nactivities and\ninvestments into\nconformance, subject\nto a June 2017\napproval by the\nFederal Reserve for a\nfive-year extension of\nthe transition period\nto conform investments\nin certain legacy\ncovered funds that are\nalso illiquid funds.\nThe approval covers\nessentially all of our\nnon-conforming\ninvestments in, and\nrelationships with,\nlegacy covered funds\nsubject to the Volcker\nRule.\n\nSince the initial\nadoption of the\nVolcker Rule\u2019s\nimplementing\nregulations, revisions\nto both the\nproprietary trading\nand covered fund\nprovisions have been\nmade, which have\ngenerally simplified\nthe application of the\nVolcker Rule.

The\nFederal Reserve\nestablishes capital\nrequirements,\nincluding well-\ncapitalized standards,\nfor large BHCs and\nevaluates our\ncompliance with such\nrequirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar\ncapital requirements\nand standards for\nMorgan Stanley Bank,\nN.A.

We\nare subject to various\nrisk-based capital\nrequirements with\nvarious transition\nprovisions, measured\nagainst our Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and\nTotal capital bases,\nleverage-based capital\nrequirements,\nincluding the SLR, and\nadditional capital\nbuffers above\ngenerally applicable\nminimum standards for\nBHCs.\n\nThe Basel Committee\nhas published a\ncomprehensive set of\nrevisions to its Basel\nIII Framework. The\nrevised requirements\nare expected to take\neffect starting\nJanuary 2023, subject\nto U.S. banking\nagencies issuing\nimplementation\nproposals. The impact\non us of any revisions\nto the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s capital\nstandards is uncertain\nand depends on future\nrulemakings by the\nU.S. banking agencies.\n\nRegulated\nSubsidiaries: In\naddition, many of our\nregulated subsidiaries\nare, or are expected\nto be in the future,\nsubject to regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding regulated\nsubsidiaries\nregistered as swap\ndealers with the CFTC\nor security-based swap\ndealers with the SEC\n(collectively, \u201cSwaps\nEntities\u201d) or\nregistered as broker-\ndealers or futures\ncommission merchants.\nSpecific regulatory\ncapital requirements\nvary by regulated\nsubsidiary, and in\nmany cases these\nstandards are still in\nproposed form, not yet\neffective or are\nsubject to ongoing\nrulemakings that could\nsubstantially modify\nrequirements.\n\nFor more information\nabout the specific\ncapital requirements\napplicable to us and\nour U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries, see\n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements.\u201d\n\nCapital Planning,\nStress Tests and\nCapital Distributions:\nPursuant to the Dodd-\nFrank Act, the Federal\nReserve has adopted\ncapital planning and\nstress test\nrequirements for large\nBHCs, including Morgan\nStanley.

Our preferred\nresolution strategy,\nwhich is set out in\nour 2019 resolution\nplan, is an SPOE\nstrategy, which\ngenerally contemplates\nthe provision of\nadequate capital and\nliquidity by the\nParent Company to\ncertain of its\nsubsidiaries so that\nsuch subsidiaries have\nthe resources\nnecessary to implement\nthe resolution\nstrategy after the\nParent Company has\nfiled for bankruptcy.\n\nUnder a final rule\nissued by the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC,\nwe are now required to\nfile resolution plans\nonce every two years,\nwith interim updates\nrequired in certain\nlimited circumstances,\nincluding material\nmergers or\nacquisitions or\nfundamental changes to\nour resolution\nstrategy. The rule\nalso allows us to\nalternate between\nsubmitting a full,\ndetailed resolution\nplan and a\nstreamlined, targeted\nresolution plan. The\nrule also clarifies\nthe information\nrequired to be\nincluded in our\nresolution plan. Our\nnext resolution plan,\ndue July 1, 2021, will\nbe a targeted\nresolution plan and\nwill reflect our\nacquisition of\nE*TRADE.\n\nFurther, we submit an\nannual recovery plan\nto the Federal Reserve\nthat outlines the\nsteps that management\ncould take\n\nover time to generate\nor conserve financial\nresources in times of\nprolonged financial\nstress.\n\nCertain of our\ndomestic and foreign\nsubsidiaries are also\nsubject to resolution\nand recovery planning\nrequirements in the\njurisdictions in which\nthey operate. For\nexample the FDIC\nrequires certain\ninsured depository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDI\u201d),\nincluding MSBNA and\nMSPBNA, to submit an\nannual resolution plan\nthat describes the\nIDI\u2019s strategy for a\nrapid and orderly\nresolution in the\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure of the IDI.\n\nIn addition, certain\nfinancial companies,\nincluding BHCs such as\nthe Firm and certain\nof its subsidiaries,\ncan be subjected to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority\nin Title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act with\nthe FDIC being\nappointed as receiver,\nprovided that certain\nprocedures are met,\nincluding certain\nextraordinary\nfinancial distress and\nsystemic risk\ndeterminations by the\nU.S. Treasury\nSecretary in\nconsultation with the\nU.S. President.\nRegulators have\nadopted certain\norderly liquidation\nauthority implementing\nregulations and may\nexpand or clarify\nthese regulations in\nthe future. If we were\nsubject to the orderly\nliquidation authority,\nthe FDIC would have\nconsiderable powers,\nincluding: the power\nto remove directors\nand officers\nresponsible for our\nfailure and to appoint\nnew directors and\nofficers; the power to\nassign our assets and\nliabilities to a third\nparty or bridge\nfinancial company\nwithout the need for\ncreditor consent or\nprior court review;\nthe ability to\ndifferentiate among\nour creditors,\nincluding by treating\ncertain creditors\nwithin the same class\nbetter than others,\nsubject to a minimum\nrecovery right on the\npart of disfavored\ncreditors to receive\nat least what they\nwould have received in\nbankruptcy\nliquidation; and broad\npowers to administer\nthe claims process to\ndetermine\ndistributions from the\nassets of the\nreceivership. The FDIC\nhas been developing an\nSPOE strategy that\ncould be used to\nimplement the orderly\nliquidation authority.\n\nRegulators have also\ntaken and proposed\nvarious actions to\nfacilitate an SPOE\nstrategy under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nor other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nand the OCC have\nestablished rules that\nimpose contractual\nrequirements on\ncertain qualified\nfinancial contracts\n(\u201ccovered QFCs\u201d) to\nwhich U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding us, and\ntheir subsidiaries\nincluding our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries, are\nparties (together, the\n\u201ccovered entities\u201d).\nUnder these rules,\ncovered QFCs must\nexpressly provide that\ntransfer restrictions\nand default rights\nagainst covered\nentities are limited\nto the same extent as\nthey would be under\nthe Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act and\nTitle II of the Dodd-\nFrank Act and their\nimplementing\nregulations, and they\nmay not, among other\nthings, permit the\nexercise of any cross-\ndefault right against\ncovered entities based\non an affiliate\u2019s\nentry into insolvency,\nresolution or similar\nproceedings, subject\nto certain creditor\nprotections.\n\nFor more information\nabout our resolution\nplan-related\nsubmissions and\nassociated regulatory\nactions, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk,\"\n                                \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    4  \n                                \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n\u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Total\nLoss-Absorbing\nCapacity, Long-Term\nDebt and Clean Holding\nCompany Requirements\u201d\nand \u201cManagement\u2019s\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Liquidity\nand Capital\nResources\u2014Regulatory R\nequirements\u2014Resolution\nand Recovery\nPlanning.\u201d\n\nCyber and Information\nSecurity Risk\nManagement and\nProtection of Client\nInformation\n\nThe financial services\nindustry faces\nincreased global\nregulatory focus\nregarding cyber and\ninformation security\nrisk management\npractices.

The Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation\nImprovement Act of\n1991 provides a\nframework for\nregulation of\ndepository\ninstitutions and their\naffiliates, including\nparent holding\ncompanies, by their\nfederal banking\nregulators. Among\nother things, it\nrequires the relevant\nfederal banking\nregulator to take\nprompt corrective\naction with respect to\na depository\ninstitution if that\ninstitution does not\nmeet certain capital\nadequacy standards.\nThese regulations\ngenerally apply only\nto insured banks and\nthrifts such as the\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries\nand not to their\nparent holding\ncompanies. The Federal\nReserve is, however,\nseparately authorized\nto take appropriate\naction at the holding\ncompany level, subject\nto certain\nlimitations. Under the\nsystemic risk regime,\nas described above, we\nalso would become\nsubject to an early\nremediation protocol\nin the event of\nfinancial distress. In\naddition, BHCs, such\nas Morgan Stanley, are\nrequired to serve as a\nsource of strength to\ntheir U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries and\ncommit resources to\nsupport these\nsubsidiaries in the\nevent such\nsubsidiaries are in\nfinancial distress.\n\nTransactions with\nAffiliates. Our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries are\nsubject to Sections\n23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act,\nwhich impose\nrestrictions on\ncovered transactions,\nas defined in the\nFederal Reserve Act,\nwith any affiliates.\nCovered transactions\ninclude any extension\nof credit to, purchase\nof assets from, and\ncertain other\ntransactions by\ninsured depository\ninstitutions with an\naffiliate. These\nrestrictions limit the\ntotal amount of credit\nexposure that our U.S.\nBank Subsidiaries may\nhave to any one\naffiliate and to all\naffiliates, and\nrequire collateral for\nthose exposures.\nSection 23B requires\naffiliate transactions\nto be on market terms.\nDerivative, securities\nborrowing and\nsecurities lending\ntransactions between\nour U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates are subject\nto these restrictions.\n                                \n  5    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nIn addition, the\nVolcker Rule generally\nprohibits covered\ntransactions between\n(i) us or any of our\naffiliates and (ii)\ncovered funds for\nwhich we or any of our\naffiliates serve as\nthe investment\nmanager, investment\nadviser, commodity\ntrading advisor or\nsponsor, or other\ncovered funds\norganized and offered\nby us or any of our\naffiliates pursuant to\nspecific exemptions.\nSee also \u201cFinancial\nHolding\nCompany\u2014Activities\nRestriction under the\nVolcker Rule\u201d above.\n\nFDIC Regulation. An\nFDIC-insured\ndepository institution\nis generally liable\nfor any loss incurred\nor expected to be\nincurred by the FDIC\nin connection with the\nfailure of an insured\ndepository institution\nunder common control\nby the same BHC. As\ncommonly controlled\nFDIC-insured\ndepository\ninstitutions, each of\nthe U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries could be\nresponsible for any\nloss to the FDIC from\nthe failure of another\nU.S. Bank Subsidiary.\nIn addition, the four\ninstitutions are\nexposed to changes in\nthe cost of FDIC\ninsurance.\n                                              \n   Institutional Securities and Wealth        \n   Management                                 \n                                              \nBroker-Dealer and\nInvestment Adviser\nRegulation.

Broker-\ndealers are subject to\nlaws and regulations\ncovering all aspects\nof the securities\nbusiness, including\nsales and trading\npractices, securities\nofferings, publication\nof research reports,\nuse of customers\u2019\nfunds and securities,\ncapital structure,\nrisk management\ncontrols in connection\nwith market access,\nrecordkeeping and\nretention, and the\nconduct of their\ndirectors, officers,\nrepresentatives and\nother associated\npersons. Broker-\ndealers are also\nregulated by\nsecurities\nadministrators in\nthose states where\nthey do business.\nViolations of the laws\nand regulations\ngoverning a broker-\ndealer\u2019s actions could\nresult in censures,\nfines, the issuance of\ncease-and-desist\norders, revocation of\nlicenses or\nregistrations, the\nsuspension or\nexpulsion from the\nsecurities industry of\nsuch broker-dealer or\nits officers or\nemployees, or other\nsimilar consequences\nby both federal and\nstate securities\nadministrators. Our\nbroker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also\nmembers of the\nSecurities Investor\nProtection\nCorporation, which\nprovides certain\nprotections for\ncustomers of broker-\ndealers against losses\nin the event of the\ninsolvency of a\nbroker-dealer.\n\nMSSB is also a\nregistered investment\nadviser with the SEC.\nMSSB\u2019s relationship\nwith its investment\nadvisory clients is\nsubject to the\nfiduciary and other\nobligations imposed on\ninvestment advisers\nunder the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940,\nand the rules and\nregulations\npromulgated thereunder\nas well as various\nstate securities laws.\nThese laws and\nregulations generally\ngrant the SEC and\nother supervisory\nbodies broad\nadministrative powers\nto address non-\n\ncompliance, including\nthe power to restrict\nor limit MSSB from\ncarrying on its\ninvestment advisory\nand other asset\nmanagement activities.\nOther sanctions that\nmay be imposed include\nthe suspension of\nindividual employees,\nlimitations on\nengaging in certain\nactivities for\nspecified periods of\ntime or for specified\ntypes of clients, the\nrevocation of\nregistrations, other\ncensures and\nsignificant fines.\n\nThe Firm is subject to\nvarious regulations\nthat affect broker-\ndealer sales practices\nand customer\nrelationships. For\nexample, the SEC's\n\u201cRegulation Best\nInterest,\u201d requires\nbroker-dealers to act\nin the \u201cbest interest\u201d\nof retail customers at\nthe time a\nrecommendation is made\nwithout placing the\nfinancial or other\ninterests of the\nbroker-dealer ahead of\nthe interest of the\nretail customer.\nCertain states have\nenacted laws or rules,\nor are considering\nlaws or rules,\nsubjecting broker-\ndealers to a fiduciary\nduty when dealing with\nretail customers under\na variety of\ncircumstances.\n\nMargin lending by\nbroker-dealers is\nregulated by the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s\nrestrictions on\nlending in connection\nwith customer and\nproprietary purchases\nand short sales of\nsecurities, as well as\nsecurities borrowing\nand lending\nactivities. Broker-\ndealers are also\nsubject to maintenance\nand other margin\nrequirements imposed\nunder FINRA and other\nself-regulatory\norganization rules. In\nmany cases, our\nbroker-dealer\nsubsidiaries\u2019 margin\npolicies are more\nstringent than these\nrules.\n\nAs registered U.S.\nbroker-dealers,\ncertain of our\nsubsidiaries are\nsubject to the SEC\u2019s\nnet capital rule and\nthe net capital\nrequirements of\nvarious exchanges,\nother regulatory\nauthorities and self-\nregulatory\norganizations. These\nrules are generally\ndesigned to measure\nthe broker-dealer\nsubsidiary\u2019s general\nfinancial integrity\nand/or liquidity and\nrequire that at least\na minimum amount of\nnet and/or liquid\nassets be maintained\nby the subsidiary.

MS&Co. and\nE*TRADE Futures LLC,\nas futures commission\nmerchants, and MSSB,\nas an introducing\nbroker, are subject to\nnet capital\nrequirements of, and\ncertain of their\nactivities are\nregulated by, the\nCFTC, the NFA, the\nJoint Audit Committee\n(including the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange &\nChicago Board of Trade\n(\u201cCME Group\u201d) in its\ncapacity as MS&Co.'s\ndesignated self-\nregulatory\n                                \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    6  \n                                \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \norganization), and\nvarious commodity\nfutures exchanges.\nMS&Co., E*TRADE\nFutures LLC and MSSB\nand certain of their\naffiliates are\nregistered with the\nCFTC and are members\nof the NFA in various\ncapacities. Rules and\nregulations of the\nCFTC, NFA, the Joint\nAudit Committee\n(including the CME\nGroup) and commodity\nfutures exchanges\naddress obligations\nrelated to, among\nother things, customer\nprotections, the\nsegregation of\ncustomer funds and the\nholding of secured\namounts, the use by\nfutures commission\nmerchants of customer\nfunds, the margining\nof customer accounts\nand documentation\nentered into by\nfutures commission\nmerchants with their\ncustomers,\nrecordkeeping and\nreporting obligations\nof futures commission\nmerchants and\nintroducing brokers,\nrisk disclosure, risk\nmanagement and\ndiscretionary trading.\n\nOur commodities\nactivities are subject\nto extensive and\nevolving energy,\ncommodities,\nenvironmental, health\nand safety, and other\ngovernmental laws and\nregulations in the\nU.S. and abroad.\nIntense scrutiny of\ncertain commodities\nmarkets by U.S.\nfederal, state and\nlocal authorities in\nthe U.S. and abroad\nand by the public has\nresulted in increased\nregulatory and legal\nenforcement and\nremedial proceedings\ninvolving companies\nconducting the\nactivities in which we\nare engaged.\n\nDerivatives\nRegulation. The\ncommodity futures,\ncommodity options and\nswaps industry in the\nU.S. is subject to\nregulation under the\nU.S. Commodity\nExchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d).\nThe CFTC is the U.S.\nfederal agency charged\nwith the\nadministration of the\nCEA. In addition, the\nSEC is the U.S.\nfederal agency charged\nwith the regulation of\nsecurity-based swaps.\nThe rules and\nregulations of various\nself-regulatory\norganizations also\ngovern derivatives.\n\nUnder the U.S.\nregulatory regime for\nswaps and security-\nbased swaps\n(collectively,\n\u201cSwaps\u201d) implemented\npursuant to the Dodd-\nFrank Act, we are\nsubject to\ncomprehensive\nregulation of our\nderivatives\nbusinesses, including\nregulations that\nimpose margin\nrequirements, public\nand regulatory\nreporting, central\nclearing and mandatory\ntrading on regulated\nexchanges or execution\nfacilities for certain\ntypes of Swaps.\n\nCFTC rules require\nregistration of swap\ndealers, mandatory\nclearing and execution\nof interest rate and\ncertain credit default\nswaps and real-time\npublic reporting and\nadherence to business\nconduct standards for\nall in-scope Swaps. We\nhave registered a\nnumber of U.S. and non\nU.S. CFTC swap\ndealers. In 2020, the\nCFTC finalized rules\nestablishing capital\nrequirements for CFTC-\nregistered swap\ndealers not subject to\nregulation by a\nprudential regulator.\nCompliance with these\nrules is required by\nOctober 6, 2021.\n\nSEC rules govern the\nregistration and\nregulation of\nsecurity- based swap\ndealers. The SEC's\nrules impose numerous\nobligations for\nentities that register\nas security-based swap\ndealers. Registration\nas a security-based\nswap dealer will be\nrequired starting in\nthe fourth quarter of\n2021, and compliance\nwith a number of these\nrules will also be\nrequired on a similar\n\ntimeline. We\nanticipate registering\nseveral entities as a\nsecurity-based swap\ndealer.\n\nThe specific\nparameters of some of\nthese requirements for\nSwaps have been and\ncontinue to be\ndeveloped through\nCFTC, SEC and bank\nregulator rulemakings.\nFor example, the rules\nfor variation margin\nare presently\neffective, and those\nfor initial margin\nwill continue to phase\nin based on activity\nlevels of the swap\ndealer and the\nrelevant counterparty\nwith the final phase\ncurrently expected to\nbegin in September\n2022. Margin rules\nwith the same or\nsimilar compliance\ndates have been\nadopted or are in the\nprocess of being\nfinalized by\nregulators outside the\nU.S., and certain of\nour subsidiaries may\nbe subject to such\nrules.\n\nAlthough a significant\nnumber of areas within\nthe global derivatives\nregulatory framework\nhave been finalized,\nadditional changes are\nexpected. As the\nderivatives regulatory\nframework continues to\nevolve, we expect to\ncontinue to face\nincreased costs and\nregulatory oversight.\nComplying with\nregistration and other\nregulatory\nrequirements has\nrequired, and is\nexpected to require in\nthe future, systems\nand other changes to\nour derivatives\nbusinesses. Compliance\nwith Swaps-related\nregulatory capital\nrequirements may also\nrequire us to devote\nmore capital to our\nbusinesses that engage\nin swaps. Our\nInstitutional\nSecurities and Wealth\nManagement business\nsegments activities\nare also regulated in\njurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. See \u201cNon-U.S.\nRegulation\u201d herein.\n                                              \n   Investment Management                      \n                                              \nMany of the\nsubsidiaries engaged\nin our investment\nmanagement activities\nare registered as\ninvestment advisers\nwith the SEC.

A slowdown\nof commercial activity\ncould cause overall\nsales and trading and\ninvestment banking\nrevenues to decline\nand a decline in\nassets under\nmanagement and client\nbalances could also\nreduce fee and\nfinancing revenues\nacross all of our\nbusiness segments.\n\nOperationally, we have\ninitiated a work\nremotely protocol and\nrestricted business\ntravel of our\nworkforce, with a\nreturn-to-workplace\nprogram, which is\nbased on role,\nlocation and employee\nwillingness and\nability to return.\nWhile we have not\n\nexperienced a decrease\nin productivity as a\nresult of the remote\nwork environment,\nthere can be no\nassurance that the\ntransition will not\nhave an adverse effect\nin the long term. If\nsignificant portions\nof our workforce,\nincluding key\npersonnel, are unable\nto work effectively\nbecause of illness,\ngovernment actions, or\nother restrictions in\nconnection with the\npandemic, the impact\nof the pandemic on our\nbusinesses could be\nexacerbated.\n\nThe extent to which\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\nand the related global\neconomic crisis,\naffects our\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition,\nas well as our\nregulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios and\nour ability to take\ncapital actions, will\ndepend on future\ndevelopments that are\nhighly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted,\nincluding the scope\nand duration of the\npandemic and any\nrecovery period, the\ndevelopment,\ndistribution, and\nacceptance of\neffective vaccines,\nfuture actions taken\nby governmental\nauthorities, central\nbanks and other third\nparties in response to\nthe pandemic, and the\neffects on our\ncustomers,\ncounterparties,\nemployees and third-\nparty service\nproviders.

These\nfluctuations impact\nresults by causing\nvariations in\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    12  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nbusiness flows and\nactivity and in the\nfair value of\nsecurities and other\nfinancial products.\nFluctuations also\noccur due to the level\nof global market\nactivity, which, among\nother things, affects\nthe size, number and\ntiming of investment\nbanking client\nassignments and\ntransactions and the\nrealization of returns\nfrom our principal\ninvestments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable\nmarket or economic\nconditions may have\nadverse impacts on the\nlevel of individual\ninvestor participation\nin the global markets\nand/or the level of\nclient assets, and, in\nvery low interest rate\nenvironments, the\nlevel of net interest\nincome, which would\nnegatively impact the\nresults of our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nSubstantial market\nfluctuations could\nalso cause variations\nin the value of our\ninvestments in our\nfunds, the flow of\ninvestment capital\ninto or from AUM, and\nthe way customers\nallocate capital among\nmoney market, equity,\nfixed income or other\ninvestment\nalternatives, which\ncould negatively\nimpact our Investment\nManagement business\nsegment.\n\nThe value of our\nfinancial instruments\nmay be materially\naffected by market\nfluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and\ndisruptions in the\ncredit markets may\nmake it extremely\ndifficult to value and\nmonetize certain of\nour financial\ninstruments,\nparticularly during\nperiods of market\ndisplacement.\nSubsequent valuations\nin future periods, in\nlight of factors then\nprevailing, may result\nin significant changes\nin the values of these\ninstruments and may\nadversely impact\nhistorical or\nprospective fees and\nperformance-based fees\n(also known as\nincentive fees, which\ninclude carried\ninterest) in respect\nof certain businesses.\nIn addition, at the\ntime of any sales and\nsettlements of these\nfinancial instruments,\nthe price we\nultimately realize\nwill depend on the\ndemand and liquidity\nin the market at that\ntime and may be\nmaterially lower than\ntheir current fair\nvalue. Any of these\nfactors could cause a\ndecline in the value\nof our financial\ninstruments, which may\nhave an adverse effect\non our results of\noperations in future\nperiods.\n\nIn addition, financial\nmarkets are\nsusceptible to severe\nevents evidenced by\nrapid depreciation in\nasset values\naccompanied by a\nreduction in asset\nliquidity. Under these\nextreme conditions,\nhedging and other risk\nmanagement strategies\nmay not be as\neffective at\nmitigating trading\nlosses as they would\nbe under more normal\nmarket conditions.\nMoreover, under these\nconditions, market\nparticipants are\nparticularly exposed\nto trading strategies\nemployed by many\nmarket participants\nsimultaneously and on\na large scale. Our\nrisk management and\nmonitoring processes\nseek to quantify and\nmitigate risk to more\nextreme market moves.\nHowever, severe market\nevents have\nhistorically been\ndifficult to predict,\nand we could realize\nsignificant losses if\nextreme market events\nwere to occur.\n\nHolding large and\nconcentrated positions\nmay expose us to\nlosses.\n\nConcentration of risk\nmay reduce revenues or\nresult in losses in\nour market-making,\ninvesting,\nunderwriting,\nincluding block\ntrading, and lending\nbusinesses in the\nevent of unfavorable\nmarket movements, or\nwhen market conditions\nare more favorable for\nour competitors. We\ncommit substantial\namounts of capital to\nthese businesses,\nwhich often results in\nour taking large\npositions in the\nsecurities of, or\nmaking large loans to,\na particular issuer or\nissuers in a\nparticular industry,\ncountry or region.

This risk may\narise from a variety\nof business\nactivities, including,\nbut not limited to:\nextending credit to\nclients through\nvarious lending\ncommitments; entering\ninto swap or other\nderivative contracts\nunder which\ncounterparties have\nobligations to make\npayments to us;\nproviding short- or\nlong-term funding that\nis secured by physical\nor financial\ncollateral whose value\nmay at times be\ninsufficient to fully\ncover the loan\nrepayment amount;\nposting margin and/or\ncollateral and other\ncommitments to\nclearing houses,\nclearing agencies,\nexchanges, banks,\nsecurities firms and\nother financial\ncounterparties; and\ninvesting and trading\nin securities and loan\npools, whereby the\nvalue of these assets\nmay fluctuate based on\nrealized or expected\ndefaults on the\nunderlying obligations\nor loans.\n\nWe also incur credit\nrisk in our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment lending to\nmainly individual\ninvestors, including,\nbut not limited to,\nmargin- and\nsecurities-based loans\ncollateralized by\nsecurities,\nresidential mortgage\nloans and HELOCs.\n\nOur valuations related\nto, and reserves for\nlosses on, credit\nexposures rely on\ncomplex models,\nestimates, and\nsubjective judgments\nabout the future.\nWhile we believe\ncurrent valuations and\nreserves adequately\naddress our perceived\nlevels of risk, future\neconomic conditions\nthat differ from or\nare more severe than\nforecast, inaccurate\nmodels or assumptions,\nor external factors\nsuch as natural\ndisasters or the\nongoing COVID-19\npandemic, could lead\nto inaccurate\nmeasurement of or\ndeterioration of\ncredit quality of our\n                                 \n  13    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nborrowers and\ncounterparties or the\nvalue of collateral\nand result in\nunexpected losses. We\nmay also incur higher\nthan anticipated\ncredit losses in\nperiods of market\nilliquidity or as a\nresult of disputes\nwith counterparties\nover the valuation of\ncollateral during\nperiods of economic\nstress. In addition,\nin the longer term,\nclimate change may\nalso have a negative\nimpact on the\nfinancial condition of\nour clients, which may\ndecrease revenues from\nthose clients and\nincrease the credit\nrisk associated with\nloans and other credit\nexposures to those\nclients.\n\nCertain of our credit\nexposures are\nconcentrated by\nproduct, industry or\ncountry. Although our\nmodels and estimates\naccount for\ncorrelations among\nrelated types of\nexposures, a change in\nthe market environment\nfor a concentrated\nproduct or an external\nfactor impacting a\nconcentrated industry\nor country may result\nin credit losses in\nexcess of amounts\nforecast.\nConcentrations of\ncredit risk are\nmanaged through the\nFirm\u2019s comprehensive\nand global Credit\nLimits Framework.\n\nIn addition, as a\nclearing member of\nseveral central\ncounterparties, we are\nresponsible for the\ndefaults or misconduct\nof our customers and\ncould incur financial\nlosses in the event of\ndefault by other\nclearing members.\nAlthough we regularly\nreview our credit\nexposures, default\nrisk may arise from\nevents or\ncircumstances that are\ndifficult to detect or\nforesee.\n\nA default by a large\nfinancial institution\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial markets.\n\nThe commercial\nsoundness of many\nfinancial institutions\nmay be closely\ninterrelated as a\nresult of credit,\ntrading, clearing or\nother relationships\namong the\ninstitutions.\nIncreased\ncentralization of\ntrading activities\nthrough particular\nclearing houses,\ncentral agents or\nexchanges as required\nby provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act may\nincrease our\nconcentration of risk\nwith respect to these\nentities. As a result,\nconcerns about, or a\ndefault or threatened\ndefault by, one\ninstitution could lead\nto significant market-\nwide liquidity and\ncredit problems,\nlosses or defaults by\nother institutions.\nThis is sometimes\nreferred to as\nsystemic risk and may\nadversely affect\nfinancial\nintermediaries, such\nas clearing houses,\nclearing agencies,\nexchanges, banks and\nsecurities firms, with\nwhich we interact on a\ndaily basis and,\ntherefore, could\nadversely affect us.\nSee also \u201cSystemic\nRisk Regime\u201d under\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand\nRegulation\u2014Financial\nHolding Company.\u201d\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nOperational risk\nrefers to the risk of\nloss, or of damage to\nour reputation,\nresulting from\ninadequate or failed\nprocesses or systems,\nfrom human factors or\nfrom external events (\ne.g. , fraud, theft,\nlegal and compliance\nrisks, cyber attacks,\ndamage to physical\nassets or the ongoing\nCOVID-19 pandemic).

In\naddition to the\ngrowing sophistication\nof certain parties,\nthe commoditization of\ncyber tools which are\nable to be weaponized\nby less sophisticated\nactors has led to an\nincrease in the\nexploitation of\ntechnological\nvulnerabilities.\nGlobal events and\ngeopolitical\ninstability may lead\nto increased nation\nstate targeting of\nfinancial institutions\nin the U.S. and\nabroad. Foreign state\nactors have become\nmore sophisticated\nover time, increasing\nthe risk of such an\nattack. Any of these\nparties may also\nattempt to\nfraudulently induce\nemployees, customers,\nclients, vendors or\nother third parties or\nusers of our systems\nto disclose sensitive\ninformation in order\nto gain access to our\ndata or that of our\nemployees or clients.\n\nCybersecurity risks\nmay also derive from\nhuman error, fraud or\nmalice on the part of\nour employees or third\nparties, including\nthird party providers,\nor may result from\naccidental\ntechnological failure.\nThese risks may be\nheightened by several\nfactors including, for\nexample, the COVID-19\npandemic, which has\ncaused the majority of\nour employees to work\nremotely and access\nour secure networks\nthrough their home\nnetworks, or as a\nresult of the\nintegration of\nacquisitions and other\nstrategic initiatives\nthat may subject us to\nnew\n                                 \n  15    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \ntechnology, customers\nor third party\nproviders.

There\nis no guarantee that\nthe measures we take\nwill provide absolute\nsecurity or\nrecoverability given\nthe techniques used in\ncyber attacks are\ncomplex and frequently\nchange, and may not be\nable to be\nanticipated.\n\nLike other financial\nservices firms, the\nFirm, its third party\nproviders, and its\nclients continue to be\nthe subject of\nunauthorized access\nattacks, mishandling\nor misuse of\ninformation, computer\nviruses or malware,\ncyber attacks designed\nto obtain confidential\ninformation, destroy\ndata, disrupt or\ndegrade service,\nsabotage systems or\ncause other damage,\ndenial of service\nattacks, data\nbreaches, social\nengineering attacks\nand other events.\nThere can be no\nassurance that such\nunauthorized access,\nmishandling or misuse\nof information, or\ncyber incidents will\nnot occur in the\nfuture, and they could\noccur more frequently\nand on a more\nsignificant scale.\n\nA cyber attack,\ninformation or\nsecurity breach or a\ntechnology failure of\nours or of a third\nparty could jeopardize\nour or our clients\u2019,\nemployees\u2019, partners\u2019,\nvendors\u2019 or\ncounterparties\u2019\npersonal,\nconfidential,\nproprietary or other\ninformation processed\nand stored in, and\ntransmitted through,\nour and our third\nparties\u2019 computer\nsystems.

Our\nliquidity could be\nnegatively affected by\nour inability to raise\nfunding in the long-\nterm or short-term\ndebt capital markets,\nour inability to\naccess the secured\nlending markets, or\nunanticipated outflows\nof cash or collateral\nby customers or\nclients. Factors that\nwe cannot control,\nsuch as disruption of\nthe financial markets\nor negative views\nabout the financial\nservices industry\ngenerally, including\nconcerns regarding\nfiscal matters in the\nU.S. and other\ngeographic areas,\ncould impair our\nability to raise\nfunding.\n\nIn addition, our\nability to raise\nfunding could be\nimpaired if investors\nor lenders develop a\nnegative perception of\nour long-term or\nshort-term financial\nprospects due to\nfactors such as an\nincurrence of large\ntrading losses, a\ndowngrade by the\nrating agencies, a\ndecline in the level\nof our business\nactivity, if\nregulatory authorities\ntake significant\naction against us or\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    16  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nour industry, or we\ndiscover significant\nemployee misconduct or\nillegal activity.\n\nIf we are unable to\nraise funding using\nthe methods described\nabove, we would likely\nneed to finance or\nliquidate unencumbered\nassets, such as our\ninvestment portfolios\nor trading assets, to\nmeet maturing\nliabilities or other\nobligations. We may be\nunable to sell some of\nour assets or we may\nhave to sell assets at\na discount to market\nvalue, either of which\ncould adversely affect\nour results of\noperations, cash flows\nand financial\ncondition.\n\nOur borrowing costs\nand access to the debt\ncapital markets depend\non our credit ratings.\n\nThe cost and\navailability of\nunsecured financing\ngenerally are impacted\nby our long-term and\nshort-term credit\nratings. The rating\nagencies continue to\nmonitor certain\ncompany-specific and\nindustry-wide factors\nthat are important to\nthe determination of\nour credit ratings.\nThese include\ngovernance, the level\nand quality of\nearnings, capital\nadequacy, liquidity\nand funding, risk\nappetite and\nmanagement, asset\nquality, strategic\ndirection, business\nmix, regulatory or\nlegislative changes,\nmacro-economic\nenvironment, and\nperceived levels of\nsupport, and it is\npossible that they\ncould downgrade our\nratings and those of\nsimilar institutions.\n\nOur credit ratings\nalso can have an\nadverse impact on\ncertain trading\nrevenues, particularly\nin those businesses\nwhere longer term\ncounterparty\nperformance is a key\nconsideration, such as\nOTC and other\nderivative\ntransactions,\nincluding credit\nderivatives and\ninterest rate swaps.\nIn connection with\ncertain OTC trading\nagreements and certain\nother agreements\nassociated with our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, we may be\nrequired to provide\nadditional collateral\nto, or immediately\nsettle any outstanding\nliability balance\nwith, certain\ncounterparties in the\nevent of a credit\nratings downgrade.\n\nTermination of our\ntrading and other\nagreements could cause\nus to sustain losses\nand impair our\nliquidity by requiring\nus to find other\nsources of financing\nor to make significant\ncash payments or\nsecurities movements.\nThe additional\ncollateral or\ntermination payments\nwhich may occur in the\nevent of a future\ncredit rating\ndowngrade vary by\ncontract and can be\nbased on ratings by\neither or both of\nMoody\u2019s Investors\nService, Inc. and S&P\nGlobal Ratings.

Ongoing\nimplementation of, or\nchanges in, including\nchanges in\ninterpretation or\nenforcement of, laws\nand regulations could\nmaterially impact the\nprofitability of our\nbusinesses and the\nvalue of assets we\nhold, expose us to\nadditional costs,\nrequire changes to\nbusiness practices or\nforce us to\ndiscontinue\nbusinesses, adversely\naffect our ability to\npay dividends and\nrepurchase our stock\nor require us to raise\ncapital, including in\nways that may\nadversely impact our\nshareholders or\ncreditors.\n\nIn addition,\nregulatory\nrequirements that are\nbeing imposed by\nforeign policymakers\nand regulators may be\ninconsistent or\nconflict with\nregulations that we\nare subject to in the\nU.S. and may adversely\naffect us. Legal and\nregulatory\nrequirements continue\nto be subject to\nongoing change, which\nmay result in\nsignificant new costs\nto comply with new or\nrevised requirements\nas well as to monitor\nfor compliance on an\nongoing basis.\n\nThe application of\nregulatory\nrequirements and\nstrategies in the U.S.\nor other jurisdictions\nto facilitate the\norderly resolution of\nlarge financial\ninstitutions may pose\na greater risk of loss\nfor our security\nholders, and subject\nus to other\nrestrictions.\n\nPursuant to the Dodd-\nFrank Act, we are\nrequired to\nperiodically submit to\nthe Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC a\nresolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy\nfor a rapid and\norderly resolution\nunder the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the\n\nevent of material\nfinancial distress or\nfailure. If the\nFederal Reserve and\nthe FDIC were to\njointly determine that\nour resolution plan\nsubmission was not\ncredible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly\nresolution, and if we\nwere unable to address\nany deficiencies\nidentified by the\nregulators, we or any\nof our subsidiaries\nmay be subject to more\nstringent capital,\nleverage, or liquidity\nrequirements or\nrestrictions on our\ngrowth, activities, or\noperations, or after a\ntwo-year period, we\nmay be required to\ndivest assets or\noperations.\n\nIn addition, provided\nthat certain\nprocedures are met, we\ncan be subject to a\nresolution proceeding\nunder the orderly\nliquidation authority\nunder Title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act with\nthe FDIC being\nappointed as receiver.\nThe FDIC\u2019s power under\nthe orderly\nliquidation authority\nto disregard the\npriority of creditor\nclaims and treat\nsimilarly situated\ncreditors differently\nin certain\ncircumstances, subject\nto certain\nlimitations, could\nadversely impact\nholders of our\nunsecured debt.

The\nParent Company has\ntransferred, and has\nagreed to transfer on\nan ongoing basis,\ncertain assets to the\nFunding IHC. In the\nevent of a resolution\nscenario, the Parent\nCompany would be\nobligated to\ncontribute all of its\nmaterial assets that\ncan be contributed\nunder the terms of the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement\n(other than shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\nParent Company and\ncertain other assets)\n(\u201cContributable\nAssets\u201d), to the\nFunding IHC. The\nFunding IHC would be\nobligated to provide\ncapital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our\nmaterial entities.\n\nThe obligations of the\nParent Company and the\nFunding IHC under the\namended and restated\nsupport agreement are\nin most cases secured\non a senior basis by\nthe assets of the\nParent Company (other\nthan shares in\nsubsidiaries of the\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    18  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nParent Company and\ncertain other assets),\nand the assets of the\nFunding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our\nmaterial entities,\nincluding the Funding\nIHC, against the\nassets of the Parent\nCompany with respect\nto such secured assets\nare effectively senior\nto unsecured\nobligations of the\nParent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE\nstrategy, whether\napplied pursuant to\nour resolution plan or\nin a resolution\nproceeding under the\norderly liquidation\nauthority, is intended\nto result in better\noutcomes for creditors\noverall, there is no\nguarantee that the\napplication of an SPOE\nstrategy, including\nthe provision of\nsupport to the Parent\nCompany\u2019s material\nentities pursuant to\nthe secured amended\nand restated support\nagreement, will not\nresult in greater\nlosses for holders of\nour securities\ncompared to a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy for us.\n\nRegulators have taken\nand proposed various\nactions to facilitate\nan SPOE strategy under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, the orderly\nliquidation authority\nand other resolution\nregimes. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequires top-tier BHCs\nof U.S. G-SIBs,\nincluding the Firm, to\nmaintain minimum\namounts of equity and\neligible long-term\ndebt TLAC in order to\nensure that such\ninstitutions have\nenough loss-absorbing\nresources at the point\nof failure to be\nrecapitalized through\nthe conversion of debt\nto equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on\neligible TLAC where\nthe SPOE strategy is\nused. The combined\nimplication of the\nSPOE resolution\nstrategy and the TLAC\nrequirement is that\nour losses will be\nimposed on the holders\nof eligible long-term\ndebt and other forms\nof eligible TLAC\nissued by the Parent\nCompany before any\nlosses are imposed on\nthe creditors of our\nmaterial entities or\nbefore putting U.S.\ntaxpayers at risk.\n\nIn addition, certain\njurisdictions,\nincluding the U.K. and\nother E.U.\njurisdictions, have\nimplemented, or are in\nthe process of\nimplementing, changes\nto resolution regimes\nto provide resolution\nauthorities with the\nability to\nrecapitalize a failing\nentity organized in\nsuch jurisdiction by\nwriting down certain\nunsecured liabilities\nor converting certain\nunsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such\n\u201cbail-in\u201d powers are\nintended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a\nfailing institution by\nallocating losses to\nits shareholders and\nunsecured creditors.\nNon-U.S. regulators\nare also considering\nrequirements that\ncertain subsidiaries\nof large financial\ninstitutions maintain\nminimum amounts of\nTLAC that would pass\nlosses up from the\nsubsidiaries to the\nParent Company and,\nultimately, to\nsecurity holders of\nthe Parent Company in\nthe event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented\nfrom paying dividends\nor taking other\ncapital actions\nbecause of regulatory\nconstraints or revised\nregulatory capital\nstandards.\n\nWe are subject to\ncomprehensive\nconsolidated\nsupervision,\nregulation and\nexamination by the\nFederal Reserve,\nincluding with respect\nto regulatory capital\nstandards, stress\ntesting and capital\nplanning. We submit,\non at least an annual\nbasis, a capital plan\nto the Federal Reserve\ndescribing proposed\ndividend payments to\nshareholders, proposed\nrepurchases of our\noutstanding securities\nand other proposed\ncapital actions\n\nthat we intend to\ntake. Our ability to\ntake capital actions\ndescribed in the\ncapital plan is\ndependent on, among\nother factors, the\nresults of supervisory\nstress tests conducted\nby the Federal Reserve\nand our compliance\nwith regulatory\ncapital standards\nimposed by the Federal\nReserve.\n\nIn addition, the\nFederal Reserve may\nchange regulatory\ncapital standards to\nimpose higher\nrequirements that\nrestrict our ability\nto take capital\nactions or may modify\nor impose other\nregulatory standards\nor restrictions that\nincrease our operating\nexpenses or constrain\nour ability to take\ncapital actions. For\nexample, on June 25,\n2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that\nit would bar share\nrepurchases and limit\ncommon stock dividend\npayments in the third\nquarter of 2020 for\nall large BHCs, and on\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nthe restrictions were\nextended through the\nfourth quarter of\n2020. On December 18,\n2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that\nit was extending\ncapital action\nsupervisory\nrestrictions\napplicable to all\nlarge BHCs into the\nfirst quarter of 2021\nwith modifications to\npermit resumptions of\nshare repurchases. The\nFederal Reserve may\nextend or further\nmodify these\nrestrictions in future\nperiods or impose new\nrestrictions.

In\naddition to the\nmonetary consequences,\nthese measures could,\nfor example, impact\nour ability to engage\nin, or impose\nlimitations on,\ncertain of our\nbusinesses.\n\nThese investigations\nand proceedings, as\nwell as the amount of\npenalties and fines\nsought, continue to\nimpact the financial\nservices industry and\ncertain U.S. and\ninternational\ngovernmental entities\nhave brought criminal\nactions against, or\nhave sought criminal\nconvictions, pleas or\ndeferred prosecution\nagreements from,\nfinancial\ninstitutions.\nSignificant regulatory\nor law enforcement\naction against us\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition or results\nof operations or cause\nus significant\nreputational harm,\nwhich could seriously\nharm our business.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nalso provides\ncompensation to\nwhistleblowers who\npresent the SEC or\nCFTC with information\nrelated to securities\nor commodities law\nviolations that leads\nto a successful\nenforcement action. As\na result of this\ncompensation, it is\npossible we could face\nan increased number of\ninvestigations by the\nSEC or CFTC.\n                                 \n  19    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nWe have been named,\nfrom time to time, as\na defendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, as well as\ninvestigations or\nproceedings brought by\nregulatory agencies,\narising in connection\nwith our activities as\na global diversified\nfinancial services\ninstitution.

In\nother cases, including\nantitrust litigation,\nwe may be subject to\nclaims for joint and\nseveral liability with\nother defendants for\ntreble damages or\nother relief related\nto alleged\nconspiracies involving\nother institutions.\nLike any large\ncorporation, we are\nalso subject to risk\nfrom potential\nemployee misconduct,\nincluding non-\ncompliance with\npolicies and improper\nuse or disclosure of\nconfidential\ninformation, or\nimproper sales\npractices or conduct.\n\nWe may be responsible\nfor representations\nand warranties\nassociated with\nresidential and\ncommercial real estate\nloans and may incur\nlosses in excess of\nour reserves.\n\nWe originate loans\nsecured by commercial\nand residential\nproperties. Further,\nwe securitize and\ntrade in a wide range\nof commercial and\nresidential real\nestate and real\nestate-related whole\nloans, mortgages and\nother real estate and\ncommercial assets and\nproducts, including\nresidential and CMBS.\nIn connection with\nthese activities, we\nhave provided, or\notherwise agreed to be\nresponsible for,\ncertain\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. Under\ncertain circumstances,\nwe may be required to\nrepurchase such assets\nor make other payments\nrelated to such assets\nif such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties were\nbreached. We have also\nmade representations\nand warranties in\nconnection with our\nrole as an originator\nof certain commercial\nmortgage loans that we\nsecuritized in CMBS.\nFor additional\ninformation, see also\nNote 15 to the\nfinancial statements.\n\nWe currently have\nseveral legal\nproceedings related to\nclaims for alleged\nbreaches of\nrepresentations and\nwarranties. If there\nare decisions adverse\nto us in those legal\nproceedings, we may\nincur losses\nsubstantially in\nexcess of our\nreserves. In addition,\nour reserves are\nbased, in part, on\ncertain factual and\nlegal assumptions. If\nthose assumptions are\nincorrect and need to\nbe revised, we may\nneed to adjust our\nreserves\nsubstantially.\n\nA failure to address\nconflicts of interest\nappropriately could\nadversely affect our\nbusinesses and\nreputation.\n\nAs a global financial\nservices firm that\nprovides products and\nservices to a large\nand diversified group\nof clients, including\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nindividuals, we face\npotential conflicts of\ninterest in the normal\ncourse of business.\nFor example, potential\nconflicts can occur\nwhen there is a\ndivergence of\ninterests between us\n\nand a client, among\nclients, between an\nemployee on the one\nhand and us or a\nclient on the other,\nor situations in which\nwe may be a creditor\nof a client. Moreover,\nwe also utilize\nmultiple brands and\nbusiness channels,\nincluding those\nresulting from our\nacquisitions, and\ncontinue to enhance\nthe collaboration\nacross business\nsegments, which may\nheighten the potential\nconflicts of interests\nor the risk of\nimproper sharing of\ninformation.\n\nWe have policies,\nprocedures and\ncontrols that are\ndesigned to identify\nand address potential\nconflicts of interest,\nand we utilize various\nmeasures, such as the\nuse of disclosure, to\nmanage these potential\nconflicts. However,\nidentifying and\nmitigating potential\nconflicts of interest\ncan be complex and\nchallenging and can\nbecome the focus of\nmedia and regulatory\nscrutiny. Indeed,\nactions that merely\nappear to create a\nconflict can put our\nreputation at risk\neven if the likelihood\nof an actual conflict\nhas been mitigated. It\nis possible that\npotential conflicts\ncould give rise to\nlitigation or\nenforcement actions,\nwhich may lead to our\nclients being less\nwilling to enter into\ntransactions in which\na conflict may occur\nand could adversely\naffect our businesses\nand reputation.\n\nOur regulators have\nthe ability to\nscrutinize our\nactivities for\npotential conflicts of\ninterest, including\nthrough detailed\nexaminations of\nspecific transactions.\nFor example, our\nstatus as a BHC\nsupervised by the\nFederal Reserve\nsubjects us to direct\nFederal Reserve\nscrutiny with respect\nto transactions\nbetween our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries and their\naffiliates. Further,\nthe Volcker Rule\nsubjects us to\nregulatory scrutiny\nregarding certain\ntransactions between\nus and our clients.\n                                              \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nOur risk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposures in all\nmarket environments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, which could\nresult in unexpected\nlosses.\n\nWe have devoted\nsignificant resources\nto develop our risk\nmanagement\ncapabilities and\nexpect to continue to\ndo so in the future.\nNonetheless, our risk\nmanagement strategies,\nmodels and processes,\nincluding our use of\nvarious risk models\nfor assessing market\nexposures and hedging\nstrategies, stress\ntesting and other\nanalysis, may not be\nfully effective in\nmitigating our risk\nexposure in all market\nenvironments or\nagainst all types of\nrisk, including risks\nthat are unidentified\nor unanticipated.\n\nAs our businesses\nchange and grow, and\nthe markets in which\nwe operate evolve, our\nrisk management\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses may not\nalways adapt with\nthose changes. Some of\nour methods of\nmanaging risk are\nbased upon our use of\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior and\nmanagement\u2019s judgment.\nAs a result, these\nmethods may not\npredict future risk\nexposures, which could\nbe significantly\ngreater than the\nhistorical measures\nindicate.\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    20  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nIn addition, many\nmodels we use are\nbased on assumptions\nor inputs regarding\ncorrelations among\nprices of various\nasset classes or other\nmarket indicators and\ntherefore cannot\nanticipate sudden,\nunanticipated or\nunidentified market or\neconomic movements,\nsuch as the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich could cause us\nto incur losses.\n\nManagement of market,\ncredit, liquidity,\noperational, model,\nlegal, regulatory and\ncompliance risks\nrequires, among other\nthings, policies and\nprocedures to record\nproperly and verify a\nlarge number of\ntransactions and\nevents, and these\npolicies and\nprocedures may not be\nfully effective. Our\ntrading risk\nmanagement strategies\nand techniques also\nseek to balance our\nability to profit from\ntrading positions with\nour exposure to\npotential losses.\n\nWhile we employ a\nbroad and diversified\nset of risk monitoring\nand risk mitigation\ntechniques, those\ntechniques and the\njudgments that\naccompany their\napplication cannot\nanticipate every\neconomic and financial\noutcome or the timing\nof such outcomes. For\nexample, to the extent\nthat our trading or\ninvesting activities\ninvolve less liquid\ntrading markets or are\notherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sales\nor hedging, we may not\nbe able to reduce our\npositions and\ntherefore reduce our\nrisk associated with\nsuch positions. We\nmay, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course\nof our trading or\ninvesting activities.\nFor more information\non how we monitor and\nmanage market and\ncertain other risks\nand related\nstrategies, models and\nprocesses, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Market Risk.\u201d\n\nPlanned replacement of\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate and\nreplacement or reform\nof other interest rate\nbenchmarks could\nadversely affect our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations.\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave commissioned\nworking groups of\nmarket participants\nand official sector\nrepresentatives to\nreplace LIBOR and\nreplace or reform\nother interest rate\nbenchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). A transition\naway from the\nwidespread use of such\nrates to alternative\nrates and other\npotential interest\nrate benchmark reforms\nhas begun and will\ncontinue over the\ncourse of the next few\nyears. There remains a\nlikelihood that most\nIBORs will not be\navailable beyond 2021,\nand regulators\nglobally have\ncontinued to emphasize\nthe need for the\nindustry to plan\naccordingly.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nBank of New York now\npublishes the Secured\nOvernight Financing\nRate based on\novernight U.S.\nTreasury repurchase\nagreement\ntransactions, which\nhas been recommended\nas the alternative to\nU.S. dollar LIBOR by\nthe Alternative\nReference Rates\nCommittee convened by\nthe Federal Reserve\nand the Federal\nReserve Bank of New\nYork. Further, the\nBank of England\npublishes a reformed\nSterling Overnight\nIndex Average,\ncomprised of a broader\nset of overnight\nSterling money market\ntransactions, which\nhas been selected by\nthe Working Group on\nSterling Risk-Free\nReference Rates as the\nalternative rate to\nSterling LIBOR.\n\nCentral bank-sponsored\ncommittees in other\njurisdictions,\nincluding Europe,\nJapan and Switzerland,\nhave selected\nalternative reference\nrates denominated in\nother currencies.\n\nThe market transition\naway from IBORs to\nalternative reference\nrates is complex and\ncould have a range of\nadverse impacts on our\nbusiness, financial\ncondition and results\nof operations. In\nparticular, such\ntransition or reform\ncould:\n\n\u2022 Adversely impact the\npricing, liquidity,\nvalue of, return on\nand trading for a\nbroad array of\nfinancial products,\nincluding any IBOR-\nlinked securities,\nloans and derivatives\nthat are included in\nour financial assets\nand liabilities;\n\n\u2022 Require extensive\nchanges to\ndocumentation that\ngoverns or references\nIBOR or IBOR-based\nproducts, including,\nfor example, pursuant\nto time-consuming\nrenegotiations of\nexisting documentation\nto modify the terms of\noutstanding securities\nand related hedging\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 Result in a\npopulation of products\nwith documentation\nthat governs or\nreferences IBOR or\nIBOR-based products\nbut that cannot be\namended due to an\ninability to obtain\nsufficient consent\nfrom counterparties or\nproduct owners;\n\n\u2022 Result in inquiries\nor other actions from\nregulators in respect\nof our (or the\nmarket\u2019s) preparation\nand readiness for the\nreplacement of an IBOR\nwith one or more\nalternative reference\nrates;\n\n\u2022 Result in disputes,\nlitigation or other\nactions with clients,\ncounterparties and\ninvestors, in various\nscenarios, such as\nregarding the\ninterpretation and\nenforceability of\nprovisions in IBOR-\nbased products such as\nfallback language or\nother related\nprovisions, including\nin the case of\nfallbacks to the\nalternative reference\nrates, any economic,\nlegal, operational or\nother impact resulting\nfrom the fundamental\ndifferences between\nthe IBORs and the\nvarious alternative\nreference rates;\n\n\u2022 Require the\ntransition and/or\ndevelopment of\nappropriate systems\nand analytics to\neffectively transition\nour risk management\nprocesses from IBORs\nto those based on one\nor more alternative\nreference rates in a\ntimely manner,\nincluding by\nquantifying value and\nrisk for various\nalternative reference\nrates, which may prove\nchallenging given the\nlimited history of the\nproposed alternative\nreference rates; and\n\n\u2022 Cause us to incur\nadditional costs in\nrelation to any of the\nabove factors.\n\nOther factors include\nthe pace of the\ntransition to the\nalternative reference\nrates, timing\nmismatches between\ncash and derivative\nmarkets, the specific\nterms and parameters\nfor and market\nacceptance of any\nalternative reference\nrate, market\nconventions for the\nuse of any alternative\nreference rate in\nconnection with a\nparticular product\n(including the timing\nand market adoption of\nany conventions\nproposed or\nrecommended by any\nindustry or other\ngroup), prices of and\nthe liquidity of\ntrading markets for\nproducts based on\nalternative reference\nrates, and our ability\nto transition and\ndevelop appropriate\nsystems and analytics\nfor one or more\nalternative reference\nrates.\n                                 \n  21    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nSee also \"Management's\nDiscussion and\nAnalysis of Financial\nCondition and Results\nof\nOperations\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\" herein.\n                                              \n  Competitive Environment                     \n                                              \nWe face strong\ncompetition from\nfinancial services\nfirms and others,\nwhich could lead to\npricing pressures that\ncould materially\nadversely affect our\nrevenue and\nprofitability.\n\nThe financial services\nindustry and all\naspects of our\nbusinesses are\nintensely competitive,\nand we expect them to\nremain so. We compete\nwith commercial banks,\nbrokerage firms,\ninsurance companies,\nexchanges, electronic\ntrading and clearing\nplatforms, financial\ndata repositories,\nsponsors of mutual\nfunds, hedge funds,\nfund managers, energy\ncompanies, financial\ntechnology firms and\nother companies\noffering financial or\nancillary services in\nthe U.S., globally and\ndigitally or through\nthe internet. We\ncompete on the basis\nof several factors,\nincluding transaction\nexecution, capital or\naccess to capital,\nproducts and services,\ninnovation,\ntechnology,\nreputation, risk\nappetite and price.\n\nOver time, certain\nsectors of the\nfinancial services\nindustry have become\nmore concentrated, as\ninstitutions involved\nin a broad range of\nfinancial services\nhave left businesses,\nbeen acquired by or\nmerged into other\nfirms, or have\ndeclared bankruptcy.\nSuch changes could\nresult in our\nremaining competitors\ngaining greater\ncapital and other\nresources, such as the\nability to offer a\nbroader range of\nproducts and services\nand geographic\ndiversity, or new\ncompetitors may\nemerge.\n\nWe have experienced\nand may continue to\nexperience pricing\npressures as a result\nof these factors and\nas some of our\ncompetitors seek to\nobtain market share by\nreducing prices,\neliminating\ncommissions or other\nfees, or providing\nmore favorable terms\nof business. In\naddition, certain of\nour competitors may be\nsubject to different,\nand, in some cases,\nless stringent, legal\nand regulatory\nregimes, than we are,\nthereby putting us at\na competitive\ndisadvantage. Some new\ncompetitors in the\nfinancial technology\nsector have sought to\ntarget existing\nsegments of our\nbusinesses that could\nbe susceptible to\ndisruption by\ninnovative or less\nregulated business\nmodels. For more\ninformation regarding\nthe competitive\nenvironment in which\nwe operate, see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Competition\u201d\nand\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation.\u201d\n\nAutomated trading\nmarkets and the\nintroduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies may\nadversely affect our\nbusiness and may\nincrease competition.\n\nWe have experienced\nintense price\ncompetition in some of\nour businesses in\nrecent years. In\nparticular, the\nability to execute\nsecurities,\nderivatives and other\nfinancial instrument\ntrades electronically\non exchanges, swap\nexecution facilities,\nother automated\ntrading platforms and\nthe introduction and\napplication of new\ntechnologies has\nincreased the pressure\non bid-offer spreads,\ncommissions, markups\nor comparable fees.\n\nThe trend toward\ndirect access to\nautomated, electronic\nmarkets will likely\ncontinue and will\nlikely increase as\nadditional markets\nmove to more automated\ntrading platforms. We\nhave experienced and\nit is likely that we\nwill continue to\nexperience competitive\npressures in these and\nother areas in the\nfuture as some of our\ncompetitors may seek\nto obtain market share\nby reducing or\neliminating bid-offer\nspreads, commissions,\nmarkups or fees.\n\nOur ability to retain\nand attract qualified\nemployees is critical\nto the success of our\nbusiness and the\nfailure to do so may\nmaterially adversely\naffect our\nperformance.\n\nOur people are our\nmost important asset\nand competition for\nqualified employees is\nintense.

Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of\ncosts related to the integration of E*TRADE,\nnet of tax as appropriate. Total integration-\nrelated expenses on a pre-tax basis include\n$151 million in Compensation expenses and $80\nmillion in Non-compensation expenses. For more\ninformation, see Note 3 to the financial\nstatements. 2. ROE and ROTCE represent\nearnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common\nshareholders as a percentage of average common\nequity and average tangible common equity,\nrespectively. When excluding integration-\nrelated costs, both the numerator and average\ndenominator are adjusted. 3. Average common\nequity and average tangible common equity for\neach business segment is determined using our\nRequired Capital framework (see \"Liquidity and\nCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Attribution of Average Common\nEquity According to the Required Capital\nFramework\u201d herein). 4. The sums of the\nsegments' Average common equity and Average\ntangible common equity do not equal the\nConsolidated measures due to Parent equity. 5.\nThe calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment\nuses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley\nby segment less preferred dividends allocated\nto each segment as a percentage of average\ncommon equity and average tangible common\nequity, respectively, allocated to each\nsegment. Return on Tangible Common Equity\nTarget In January 2021, we established a\n2-year ROTCE Target of 14% to 16%, excluding\nintegration-related expenses. Our ROTCE Target\nis a forward-looking statement that was based\non a normal market environment and may be\nmaterially affected by many factors,\nincluding, among other things: mergers and\nacquisitions; macroeconomic and market\nconditions; legislative, accounting, tax and\nregulatory developments; industry trading and\ninvestment banking volumes; equity market\nlevels; interest rate environment; outsized\nlegal expenses or penalties; the ability to\ncontrol expenses; and capital levels. See\n\u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d for additional information. Given the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it\nis uncertain if the ROTCE Target will be met\nwithin the originally stated time frame.

Certain revenues and expenses have\nbeen allocated to each business segment,\ngenerally in proportion to its respective net\nrevenues, non-interest expenses or other\nrelevant measures. See Note 23 to the\nfinancial statements for information on\nintersegment transactions. Net Revenues\nInvestment Banking Investment banking revenues\nare derived from client engagements in which\nwe act as an adviser, underwriter or\ndistributor of capital. Within the\nInstitutional Securities business segment,\nthese revenues are primarily composed of fees\nearned from underwriting equity and fixed\nincome securities, syndicating loans and\nadvisory services in relation to mergers and\nacquisitions, divestitures and corporate\nrestructurings.

Trading Trading revenues include\nthe realized gains and losses from\ntransactions in financial instruments,\nunrealized gains and losses from ongoing\nchanges in the fair value of our positions,\nand gains and losses from financial\ninstruments used to economically hedge\ncompensation expense related to certain\nemployee deferred compensation plans. Within\nthe Institutional Securities business segment,\nTrading revenues arise from transactions in\ncash instruments and derivatives in which we\nact as a market maker for our clients. In this\nrole, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise\ntransact with customers under a variety of\nmarket conditions and to provide firm or\nindicative prices in response to customer\nrequests. Our liquidity obligations can be\nexplicit in some cases, and in others,\ncustomers expect us to be willing to transact\nwith them. In order to most effectively\nfulfill our market-making function, we engage\nin activities across all of our trading\nbusinesses that include, but are not limited\nto: \u2022 taking positions in anticipation of, and\nin response to, customer demand to buy or sell\nand\u2014depending on the liquidity of the relevant\nmarket and the size of the position\u2014to hold\nthose positions for a period of time; \u2022\nbuilding, maintaining and rebalancing\ninventory held to facilitate client activity\nthrough trades with other market participants;\n\u2022 managing and assuming basis risk (risk\nassociated with imperfect hedging) between\nrisks incurred from the facilitation of client\ntransactions and the standardized products\navailable in the market to hedge those risks;\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    30  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n\u2022 trading in the\nmarket to remain\ncurrent on pricing and\ntrends; and\n\n\u2022 engaging in other\nactivities to provide\nefficiency and\nliquidity for markets.\n\nIn many markets, the\nrealized and\nunrealized gains and\nlosses from purchase\nand sale transactions\nwill include any\nspreads between bids\nand offers.

Equity Equity sales\nand trading net revenues of $9,801 million in\n2020 increased 22% compared with the prior\nyear, reflecting strong performance in both\nour execution services and financing\nbusinesses. \u2022 Financing revenues increased\noverall, primarily driven by client activity.\nIn addition, changes in market rates and\nfinancing mix contributed to higher Net\ninterest revenues and an offsetting reduction\nin Trading revenues. \u2022 Execution services\nrevenues increased, primarily reflecting\nhigher client activity and the impact of\nmarket conditions on inventory held to\nfacilitate client activity in derivatives and\ncash equities. Fixed Income Fixed income net\nrevenues of $8,824 million in 2020 increased\n59% compared with the prior year, reflecting\nstrong performance across all products. \u2022\nGlobal macro products revenues increased,\nprimarily due to higher client activity in\nboth rates and foreign exchange\n\nproducts and the impact of market conditions\non inventory held to facilitate client\nactivity. \u2022 Credit products revenues\nincreased, primarily due to higher client\nactivity in corporate credit and securitized\nproducts from higher volumes and wider bid-\noffer spreads, partially offset by the impact\nof market conditions on inventory held to\nfacilitate client activity. Lower funding\ncosts and higher average secured lending\nfacilities balances contributed to higher Net\ninterest revenues. \u2022 Commodities products and\nOther revenues increased, primarily reflecting\nthe impact of market conditions on inventory\nheld to facilitate client activity and higher\nclient activity in Commodities, partially\noffset by lower client structuring activity\nwithin derivative counterparty credit risk\nmanagement. Other \u2022 Other sales and trading\nrevenues of $167 million in 2020 increased 80%\ncompared with the prior year, primarily\nreflecting gains on hedges associated with\ncorporate lending activity compared with\nlosses in the prior year, partially offset by\nlower rates on liquidity investments.\nInvestments, Other Revenues, Non-interest\nExpenses and Income Tax Items Investments \u2022\nNet investment gains of $166 million in 2020\ndecreased 49% compared with the prior year\nprimarily due to the absence of a gain\nassociated with an investment\u2019s initial public\noffering. Other Revenues \u2022 Other net losses\nwere $214 million in 2020 compared with Other\nrevenues of $632 million in the prior year.\nThis change was primarily as a result of mark-\nto-market losses on loans and lending\ncommitments held for sale in the current year,\nas credit spreads widened, compared with gains\nin the prior year, as well as an increase in\nthe provision for credit losses on loans held\nfor investment in the current year. Non-\ninterest Expenses Non-interest expenses of\n$16,797 million in 2020 increased 13% compared\nwith the prior year, reflecting a 12% increase\nin Compensation and benefits expenses and a\n13% increase in Non-compensation expenses\ncompared with the prior year. \u2022 Compensation\nand benefits expenses increased, primarily due\nto increases in discretionary incentive\ncompensation, driven by higher revenues. \u2022\nNon-compensation expenses increased, primarily\nreflecting higher volume-related expenses and\nan increase in the provision for credit losses\nfor lending commitments.\n                                 \n  35    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n                                              \n  Income Tax Items                            \n                                              \nNet discrete tax\nbenefits of $68\nmillion and $400\nmillion were\nrecognized in\nProvision for income\ntaxes in 2020 and\n2019, respectively .\nThe provision for\nincome taxes in 2020\ncompared with the\nprior year was also\nimpacted by the higher\nlevel of earnings.

For the\n2020 performance year,\ndeferred cash-based\ncompensation was\nawarded to a reduced\ngroup of eligible\nemployees compared\nwith the prior year.\nAdditionally in 2020,\ncertain changes to our\ncompensation deferral\nformula resulted in\nless cash-based\ncompensation being\ndeferred. Employees\nare permitted to\nallocate the value of\ntheir deferred awards\namong a menu of\nnotional investments,\nwhereby the value of\ntheir awards will\ntrack the performance\nof the referenced\nnotional investments.\nThe menu of\ninvestments, which is\nselected by the Firm,\nincludes fixed income,\nequity, commodity and\nmoney market funds.\nCompensation expense\nfor deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nawards is calculated\nbased on the notional\nvalue of the award\ngranted, adjusted for\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of the\nreferenced investments\nthat employees select.\nCompensation expense\nis recognized over the\nvesting period\nrelevant to each\nseparately vesting\nportion of deferred\nawards. The Firm\ninvests directly, as a\nprincipal, in\nfinancial instruments\nand other investments\nto economically hedge\ncertain of its\nobligations under\nthese deferred cash-\nbased compensation\nplans. Changes in the\nvalue of such\ninvestments\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    42  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nare recorded in\nTrading and\nInvestments revenues.\nAlthough changes in\ncompensation expense\nresulting from changes\nin the fair value of\nthe referenced\ninvestments will\ngenerally be offset by\nchanges in the fair\nvalue of investments\nmade by the Firm,\nthere is typically a\ntiming difference\nbetween the immediate\nrecognition of gains\nand losses on the\nFirm\u2019s investments and\nthe deferred\nrecognition of the\nrelated compensation\nexpense over the\nvesting period. While\nthis timing difference\nis generally not\nmaterial to Income\nfrom continuing\noperations before\nincome taxes in any\nindividual period, it\nmay impact Firm\nreported ratios (\ne.g., the Expense\nefficiency ratio) in\ncertain periods. At\nDecember 31, 2020,\nsubstantially all\nemployee notional\ninvestments that\nsubjected the Firm to\nprice risk were\nhedged.

Critical\nAccounting Policies\nOur financial\nstatements are\nprepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, which\nrequires us to make\nestimates and\nassumptions (see Note\n1 to the financial\nstatements). We\nbelieve that of our\nsignificant accounting\npolicies (see Note 2\nto the financial\nstatements), the\nfollowing policies\ninvolve a higher\ndegree of judgment and\ncomplexity. Fair Value\nFinancial Instruments\nMeasured at Fair Value\nA significant number\nof our financial\ninstruments are\ncarried at fair value.\nWe make estimates\nregarding the\nvaluation of assets\nand liabilities\nmeasured at fair value\nin preparing the\nfinancial statements.\nThese assets and\nliabilities include,\nbut are not limited\nto: \u2022 Trading assets\nand Trading\nliabilities; \u2022\nInvestment\nSecurities\u2014AFS; \u2022\nCertain Securities\npurchased under\nagreements to resell;\n\u2022 Certain Deposits,\nprimarily certificates\nof deposit; \u2022 Certain\nSecurities sold under\nagreements to\nrepurchase;\n                                 \n  43    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n\u2022 Certain Other\nsecured financings;\nand\n\n\u2022 Certain Borrowings.\n\nFair value is defined\nas the price that\nwould be received to\nsell an asset or paid\nto transfer a\nliability ( i.e. , the\nexit price) in an\norderly transaction\nbetween market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date.\n\nIn determining fair\nvalue, we use various\nvaluation approaches.\nA hierarchy for inputs\nis used in measuring\nfair value that\nmaximizes the use of\nobservable prices and\ninputs and minimizes\nthe use of\nunobservable prices\nand inputs by\nrequiring that the\nrelevant observable\ninputs be used when\navailable. The\nhierarchy is broken\ndown into three\nlevels, wherein Level\n1 represents quoted\nprices in active\nmarkets, Level 2\nrepresents valuations\nbased on quoted prices\nin markets that are\nnot active or for\nwhich all significant\ninputs are observable,\nand Level 3 consists\nof valuation\ntechniques that\nincorporate\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nand, therefore,\nrequire the greatest\nuse of judgment.\n\nIn periods of market\ndisruption, the\nobservability of\nprices and inputs may\nbe reduced for many\ninstruments, which\ncould cause an\ninstrument to be\nrecategorized from\nLevel 1 to Level 2 or\nfrom Level 2 to Level\n3. In addition, a\ndownturn in market\nconditions could lead\nto declines in the\nvaluation of many\ninstruments. For\nfurther information on\nthe definition of fair\nvalue, Level 1, Level\n2, Level 3 and related\nvaluation techniques,\nand quantitative\ninformation about and\nsensitivity of\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nused in Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements,\nsee Notes 2 and 5 to\nthe financial\nstatements.\n\nWhere appropriate,\nvaluation adjustments\nare made to account\nfor various factors\nsuch as liquidity risk\n(bid-ask adjustments),\ncredit quality, model\nuncertainty,\nconcentration risk and\nfunding in order to\narrive at fair value.\nFor a further\ndiscussion of\nvaluation adjustments\nthat we apply, see\nNote 2 to the\nfinancial statements.\n                                              \n  Goodwill and Intangible Assets              \n                                              \n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe test goodwill for\nimpairment on an\nannual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an\ninterim basis when\ncertain events or\ncircumstances exist.\nEvaluating goodwill\nfor impairment\nrequires management to\nmake significant\njudgments. Goodwill\nimpairment tests are\nperformed at the\nreporting unit level,\nwhich is generally at\nthe level of or one\nlevel below our\nbusiness segments.\nGoodwill no longer\nretains its\nassociation with a\nparticular acquisition\nonce it has been\nassigned to a\nreporting unit. As\nsuch, all the\nactivities of a\nreporting unit,\nwhether acquired or\norganically developed,\nare available to\nsupport the value of\nthe goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual\nand interim tests, we\nhave the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is\n\nless than its carrying\namount, in which case\nthe quantitative test\nwould be performed.\n\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, we\ncompare the fair value\nof a reporting unit\nwith its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited by the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\n\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunits is derived based\non valuation\ntechniques we believe\nmarket participants\nwould use for each of\nthe reporting units.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue is generally\ndetermined by\nutilizing a discounted\ncash flow methodology\nor methodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncertain comparable\ncompanies. At each\nannual goodwill\nimpairment testing\ndate, each of our\nreporting units with\ngoodwill had a fair\nvalue that was\nsubstantially in\nexcess of its carrying\nvalue.\n                                              \n  Intangible Assets                           \n                                              \nAmortizable intangible\nassets are initially\nrecorded at cost, or\nin the situation where\nacquired as part of a\nbusiness combination,\nat the fair value\ndetermined as part of\nthe acquisition method\nof accounting.\nSubsequently, they are\ncarried in the balance\nsheets at amortized\ncost, where\namortization is\nrecognized over their\nestimated useful\nlives.\n\nWhen certain events or\ncircumstances exist,\namortizable intangible\nassets are reviewed\nfor impairment on an\ninterim basis. An\nimpairment exists when\nthe carrying amount of\nthe intangible asset\nexceeds its fair\nvalue. An impairment\nloss will be\nrecognized if the\ncarrying amount of the\nintangible asset is\nnot recoverable and\nexceeds its fair\nvalue. The carrying\namount of the\nintangible asset is\nnot recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the\nexpected undiscounted\ncash flows.\n\nThe initial valuation\nof an intangible asset\nas part of the\nacquisition method of\naccounting and the\nsubsequent valuation\nof intangible assets\nas part of impairment\nassessments are\nsubjective and based,\nin part, on inputs\nthat are unobservable.\nThese inputs include,\nbut are not limited\nto, forecasted cash\nflows, revenue growth\nrates, customer\nattrition rates and\ndiscount rates.\n\nFor both goodwill and\nintangible assets, to\nthe extent an\nimpairment loss is\nrecognized, the loss\nestablishes the new\ncost basis of the\nasset. Subsequent\nreversal of impairment\nlosses is not\npermitted. For\namortizable intangible\nassets, the new cost\nbasis is amortized\nover the remaining\nuseful life of that\nasset. Adverse market\nor economic events\ncould result in\nimpairment charges in\nfuture periods.\n\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 11\nto the financial\nstatements for\nadditional information\nabout goodwill and\nintangible assets.\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    44  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Contingencies          \n                                              \nIn the normal course\nof business, we have\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with our\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\n\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress.\n\nWe are also involved,\nfrom time to time, in\nother reviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding our\nbusiness and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales and\ntrading activities,\nwealth and investment\nmanagement services,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby us, and accounting\nand operational\nmatters, certain of\nwhich may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions\nor other relief.\n\nAccruals for\nlitigation and\nregulatory proceedings\nare generally\ndetermined on a case-\nby-case basis. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand we can reasonably\nestimate the amount of\nthat loss, we accrue\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and addressing\nnovel or unsettled\nlegal questions\nrelevant to the\nproceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion.\n\nSignificant judgment\nis required in\ndeciding when and if\nto make these\naccruals, and the\nactual cost of a legal\nclaim or regulatory\nfine/penalty may\nultimately be\nmaterially different\nfrom the recorded\naccruals.\n\nSee Note 15 to the\nfinancial statements\nfor additional\ninformation on legal\ncontingencies.\n                                              \n  Income Taxes                                \n                                              \nWe are subject to the\nincome and indirect\ntax laws of the U.S.,\nits states and\nmunicipalities and\nthose of the foreign\njurisdictions in which\nwe have significant\nbusiness operations.\nThese tax laws are\ncomplex and subject to\ndifferent\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the\nrelevant governmental\ntaxing authorities. We\nmust make judgments\nand interpretations\nabout the application\nof these inherently\ncomplex tax laws when\ndetermining the\nprovision for income\ntaxes and the expense\nfor indirect taxes and\nmust also make\nestimates about when\ncertain items affect\ntaxable income in the\nvarious tax\njurisdictions.\n\nDisputes over\ninterpretations of the\ntax laws may be\nsettled with the\ntaxing authority upon\nexamination or audit.\nWe periodically\nevaluate the\nlikelihood of\nassessments in each\ntaxing jurisdiction\nresulting from current\nand subsequent years\u2019\nexaminations, and\nunrecognized tax\nbenefits related to\npotential losses that\nmay arise from tax\naudits are established\nin accordance with the\nrelevant accounting\nguidance.

Deferred\nincome taxes reflect\nthe net tax effects of\ntemporary differences\nbetween the financial\nreporting and tax\nbases of assets and\nliabilities and are\nmeasured using the\napplicable enacted tax\nrates and laws that\nwill be in effect when\nsuch differences are\nexpected to reverse.\n\nOur deferred tax\nbalances may also\ninclude deferred\nassets related to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards, such as\nnet operating losses\nand tax credits that\nwill be realized\nthrough reduction of\nfuture tax liabilities\nand, in some cases,\nare subject to\nexpiration if not\nutilized within\ncertain periods. We\nperform regular\nreviews to ascertain\nwhether deferred tax\nassets are realizable.\nThese reviews include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions\nregarding future\ntaxable income and\nincorporate various\ntax planning\nstrategies, including\nstrategies that may be\navailable to tax\nattribute\ncarryforwards before\nthey expire.\n\nOnce the deferred tax\nasset balances have\nbeen determined, we\nmay record a valuation\nallowance against the\ndeferred tax asset\nbalances to reflect\nthe amount we estimate\nis more likely than\nnot to be realized at\na future date.

Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework The primary\ngoal of our Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework is to ensure\nthat we have access to\nadequate funding\nacross a wide range of\nmarket conditions and\ntime horizons. The\nframework is designed\nto enable us to\nfulfill our financial\nobligations and\nsupport the execution\nof our business\nstrategies. The\nfollowing principles\nguide our Liquidity\nRisk Management\nFramework: \u2022\nSufficient Liquidity\nResources should be\nmaintained to cover\nmaturing liabilities\nand other planned and\ncontingent outflows; \u2022\nMaturity profile of\nassets and liabilities\nshould be aligned,\nwith limited reliance\non short-term funding;\n\u2022 Source,\ncounterparty,\ncurrency, region and\nterm of funding should\nbe diversified; and\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    46  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \n\u2022 Liquidity Stress\nTests should\nanticipate, and\naccount for, periods\nof limited access to\nfunding. The core\ncomponents of our\nLiquidity Risk\nManagement Framework\nare the Required\nLiquidity Framework,\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nand Liquidity\nResources, which\nsupport our target\nliquidity profile.\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework Our Required\nLiquidity Framework\nestablishes the amount\nof liquidity we must\nhold in both normal\nand stressed\nenvironments to ensure\nthat our financial\ncondition and overall\nsoundness are not\nadversely affected by\nan inability (or\nperceived inability)\nto meet our financial\nobligations in a\ntimely manner. The\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework considers\nthe most constraining\nliquidity requirement\nto satisfy all\nregulatory and\ninternal limits at a\nconsolidated and legal\nentity level.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nWe use Liquidity\nStress Tests to model\nexternal and\nintercompany liquidity\nflows across multiple\nscenarios and a range\nof time horizons.\nThese scenarios\ncontain various\ncombinations of\nidiosyncratic and\nsystemic stress events\nof different severity\nand duration. The\nmethodology,\nimplementation,\nproduction and\nanalysis of our\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nare important\ncomponents of the\nRequired Liquidity\nFramework. The\nassumptions used by us\nin our various\nLiquidity Stress Test\nscenarios include, but\nare not limited to,\nthe following: \u2022 No\ngovernment support; \u2022\nNo access to equity\nand unsecured debt\nmarkets; \u2022 Repayment\nof all unsecured debt\nmaturing within the\nstress horizon; \u2022\nHigher haircuts for\nand significantly\nlower availability of\nsecured funding; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\nby trading\ncounterparties,\ncertain exchanges and\nclearing organizations\nrelated to credit\nrating downgrades; \u2022\nAdditional collateral\nthat would be required\ndue to collateral\nsubstitutions,\ncollateral disputes\nand uncalled\ncollateral; \u2022\nDiscretionary\nunsecured debt\nbuybacks; \u2022 Drawdowns\non lending commitments\nprovided to third\nparties; and \u2022 Client\ncash withdrawals and\nreduction in customer\nshort positions that\nfund long positions.\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nare produced and\nresults are reported\nat different levels,\nincluding major\noperating subsidiaries\nand major currencies,\nto capture specific\ncash requirements and\ncash availability\nacross the Firm,\nincluding a limited\nnumber of asset sales\nin a stressed\nenvironment. The\nLiquidity Stress Tests\nassume that\nsubsidiaries will use\ntheir own liquidity\nfirst to fund their\nobligations before\ndrawing liquidity from\nthe Parent Company and\nthat the Parent\nCompany will support\nits\n\nsubsidiaries and will\nnot have access to\nsubsidiaries\u2019\nliquidity reserves. In\naddition to the\nassumptions\nunderpinning the\nLiquidity Stress\nTests, we take into\nconsideration\nsettlement risk\nrelated to intraday\nsettlement and\nclearing of securities\nand financing\nactivities. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, we\nmaintained sufficient\nLiquidity Resources to\nmeet current and\ncontingent funding\nobligations as modeled\nin our Liquidity\nStress Tests.\nLiquidity Resources We\nmaintain sufficient\nliquidity resources,\nwhich consist of HQLA\nand cash deposits with\nbanks (\u201cLiquidity\nResources\u201d) to cover\ndaily funding needs\nand to meet strategic\nliquidity targets\nsized by the Required\nLiquidity Framework\nand Liquidity Stress\nTests. The total\namount of Liquidity\nResources is actively\nmanaged by us\nconsidering the\nfollowing components:\nunsecured debt\nmaturity profile;\nbalance sheet size and\ncomposition; funding\nneeds in a stressed\nenvironment, inclusive\nof contingent cash\noutflows; legal\nentity, regional and\nsegment liquidity\nrequirements;\nregulatory\nrequirements; and\ncollateral\nrequirements.

We\npursue a strategy of\ndiversification of\nsecured and unsecured\nfunding sources (by\nproduct, investor and\nregion) and attempt to\nensure that the tenor\nof our liabilities\nequals or exceeds the\nexpected holding\nperiod of the assets\nbeing financed. We\nfund our balance sheet\non a global basis\nthrough diverse\nsources. These sources\ninclude our equity\ncapital, borrowings,\nsecurities sold under\nagreements to\nrepurchase, securities\nlending, deposits,\nletters of credit and\nlines of credit. We\nhave active financing\nprograms for both\nstandard and\nstructured products\ntargeting global\ninvestors and\ncurrencies. Secured\nFinancing The liquid\nnature of the\nmarketable securities\nand short-term\nreceivables arising\nprincipally from sales\nand trading activities\nin the Institutional\nSecurities business\nsegment provides us\nwith flexibility in\nmanaging the\ncomposition and size\nof our balance sheet.\nOur goal is to achieve\nan optimal mix of\ndurable secured and\nunsecured financing.\nSecured financing\ninvestors principally\nfocus on the quality\nof the eligible\ncollateral posted.\nAccordingly, we\nactively manage our\nsecured financings\nbased on the quality\nof the assets being\nfunded.

Leverage-\nBased Regulatory\nCapital. Minimum\nleverage-based capital\nrequirements include a\nTier 1 leverage ratio\nand an SLR. We are\nrequired to maintain\nan SLR of 5%,\ninclusive of an\nenhanced SLR capital\nbuffer of at least 2%.\nAs of December 31,\n2020, our risk-based\nand leverage-based\ncapital amounts and\nratios, as well as\nRWA, adjusted average\nassets and\nsupplementary leverage\nexposure are\ncalculated excluding\nthe effect of the\nadoption of CECL based\non our election to\ndefer this effect over\na five-year transition\nperiod.

Amounts reflect assets not in\na defined category, non-material portfolios of\nexposures and unsettled transactions, as\napplicable. Credit risk RWA increased in 2020\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches, primarily from an increase in\nDerivatives exposures driven by market\nvolatility and an increase in Investment\nsecurities mainly as a result of the E*TRADE\nacquisition. The increase was also driven by\nLending commitments within the Wealth\nManagement and Institutional Securities\nbusiness segments and an increase in Equity\ninvestments due to higher exposure and market\nvalue gains. In addition, credit risk RWA\nunder the Advanced Approach increased for CVA,\nmainly due to increased exposure in\nDerivatives and higher credit spread\nvolatility. Market risk RWA increased in 2020\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced\nApproaches primarily due to an increase in\nRegulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher\nmarket volatility. The decrease in operational\nrisk RWA under the Advanced Approach in 2020\nreflects a decline in the frequency and\nseverity of litigation-related losses.\n\nG-SIB Capital Surcharge We and other U.S.\nG-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital\nsurcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB\ncapital surcharge under two methods and use\nthe higher of the two surcharges. The first\nmethod considers the G-SIB\u2019s size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, complexity and substitutability,\nwhich is generally consistent with the\nmethodology developed by the Basel Committee\n(\u201cMethod 1\u201d). The second method uses similar\ninputs but replaces substitutability with the\nuse of short-term wholesale funding (\u201cMethod\n2\u201d) and generally results in higher surcharges\nthan the first method. The G-SIB capital\nsurcharge must be satisfied using Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital and functions as an\nextension of the capital conservation buffer.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt\nand Clean Holding Company Requirements The\nFederal Reserve has established external TLAC,\nlong-term debt (\u201cLTD\u201d) and clean holding\ncompany requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S.\nG-SIBs (\u201ccovered BHCs\u201d), including the Parent\nCompany. These requirements are designed to\nensure that covered BHCs will have enough\nloss-absorbing resources at the point of\nfailure to be recapitalized through the\nconversion of eligible LTD to equity or\notherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD\nor other forms of TLAC where an SPOE\nresolution strategy is used (see\n\u201cBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Financial\nHolding Company\u2014Resolution and Recovery\nPlanning\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Legal, Regulatory\nand Compliance Risk\u201d). These TLAC and eligible\nLTD requirements include various restrictions,\nsuch as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued\nby the covered BHC and be unsecured; have a\nmaturity of one year or more from the date of\nissuance; and not contain certain embedded\nfeatures, such as a principal or redemption\namount subject to reduction based on the\nperformance of an asset, entity or index, or a\nsimilar feature.

Required ratios are inclusive of applicable\nbuffers. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer\nrequirements on top of both the risk-based and\nleverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum\nrequirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is\nequal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB\nsurcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a\npercentage of total RWA. The leverage\nexposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of\nour total leverage exposure. Failure to\nmaintain the buffers would result in\nrestrictions on our ability to make capital\ndistributions, including the payment of\ndividends and the repurchase of stock, and to\npay discretionary bonuses to executive\nofficers. 2. External TLAC consists of Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1\ncapital (each excluding any noncontrolling\nminority interests), as well as eligible LTD.\n3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by\n50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be\npaid in more than one year but less than two\nyears from each respective balance sheet date.\nFurthermore, under the clean holding company\nrequirements of the final rule, a covered BHC\nis prohibited from incurring any external debt\nwith an original maturity of less than one\nyear or certain other liabilities, regardless\nof whether the liabilities are fully secured\nor otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or\nentering into certain other prohibited\ntransactions. Certain other external\nliabilities, including those with certain\nembedded features noted above, are subject to\na cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC\u2019s\noutstanding external TLAC amount. We are in\ncompliance with all TLAC requirements as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Additionally, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have issued a final rule\nthat, among other things, modifies the\nregulatory capital framework for large U.S.\nbanking organizations, including us and our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries. Under the final rule,\nsuch organizations are required to make\ncertain deductions from regulatory capital for\ntheir investments in certain unsecured debt\ninstruments (including eligible LTD in the\nTLAC framework) issued by the Parent Company\nand other G-SIBs. These requirements become\neffective on April 1, 2021, and we expect to\nbe in compliance with the final rule by the\neffective date. Capital Plans, Stress Tests\nand the Stress Capital Buffer Pursuant to the\nDodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has\nadopted capital planning and stress test\nrequirements for large BHCs, which form part\nof the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR\nframework. We must submit, on at least an\nannual basis, a capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate annual stress tests designed by us\nand the Federal\n\nReserve, so that the Federal Reserve may\nassess our systems and processes that\nincorporate forward-looking projections of\nrevenues and losses to monitor and maintain\nour internal capital adequacy. As banks with\nless than $250 billion of total assets, our\nU.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to\ncompany-run stress test regulatory\nrequirements. The capital plan must include a\ndescription of all planned capital actions\nover a nine-quarter planning horizon,\nincluding any issuance or redemption of a debt\nor equity capital instrument, any capital\ndistribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or\nstock repurchases) and any similar action that\nthe Federal Reserve determines could impact\nour consolidated capital. The capital plan\nmust include a discussion of how we will\nmaintain capital above the minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios, and how we will serve as a\nsource of strength to our U.S. Bank\nSubsidiaries under supervisory stress\nscenarios. In addition, the Federal Reserve\nhas issued guidance setting out its heightened\nexpectations for capital planning practices at\ncertain large financial institutions,\nincluding us. In 2020, the Federal Reserve\nadopted a final rule to integrate its annual\ncapital planning and stress testing\nrequirements with existing applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. The final\nrule, which applies to certain BHCs, including\nus, introduced an SCB and related changes to\nthe capital planning and stress testing\nprocesses. The final rule does not change\nregulatory capital requirements under the\nAdvanced Approach, the Tier 1 leverage ratio\nor the SLR. However, failure to meet Advanced\nApproach or SLR regulatory capital\nrequirements, inclusive of applicable capital\nbuffers, would also result in automatic\ncapital distribution limitations. The SCB\napplies only with respect to Standardized\nApproach risk-based capital requirements and\nreplaces the existing Common Equity Tier 1\ncapital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The SCB\nis the greater of (i) the maximum decline in\nour Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under\nthe severely adverse scenario over the\nsupervisory stress test measurement period\nplus the sum of the four quarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends divided by the\nprojected RWAs from the quarter in which the\nFirm\u2019s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital\nratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory\nstress test and (ii) 2.5%. Under the SCB final\nrule, the supervisory stress test now assumes\nthat BHCs generally maintain a constant level\nof assets and RWAs throughout the projection\nperiod. In addition, it no longer assumes that\nBHCs make all planned capital distributions,\nalthough the SCB incorporates the amount of\nfour quarters of planned common stock\ndividends. Similarly, the final rule\neliminates the annual process in which the\nFederal Reserve provided its objection or non-\nobjection to a firm\u2019s capital plan, given the\nintegration of stress test results into\nautomatic distribution limitations resulting\nfrom failure to meet SCB requirements. Federal\nReserve approval for capital actions is still\nrequired in some specific circumstances.\n                                 \n  55    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nA firm\u2019s SCB is\nsubject to revision\neach year, with effect\nfrom October 1, to\nreflect the results of\nthe Federal Reserve's\nannual supervisory\nstress test.

On June\n25, 2020, the Federal\nReserve published\nsummary results of its\nsupervisory stress\ntests of each large\nBHC. On June 29, 2020,\nwe disclosed a summary\nof the results of our\ncompany-run stress\ntests on our Investor\nRelations website. On\nSeptember 4, 2020, we\nannounced we would be\nsubject to an SCB of\n5.7% beginning October\n1, 2020, which\nreflects the Federal\nReserve\u2019s 2020\nsupervisory stress\ntest results,\ninclusive of\ncorrections from the\noriginal results\nannounced in June\n2020. Together with\nother features of the\nregulatory capital\nframework, this\nrevised SCB results in\nan aggregate\nStandardized Approach\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nrequired ratio of\n13.2%.\n\nIn 2020, the Federal\nReserve required all\nlarge BHCs to update\nand resubmit their\ncapital plans in\nresponse to changes in\nfinancial markets or\nthe macroeconomic\noutlook associated\nwith the COVID-19\npandemic. On November\n2, 2020, we\nresubmitted our 2020\nCapital Plan and\ncompany-run stress\ntest results based on\nrevised scenarios\nreleased by the\nFederal Reserve on\nSeptember 17, 2020. On\nDecember 18, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve\npublished summary\nresults of the second\nround of supervisory\nstress tests for each\nlarge BHC, including\nus. While the Federal\nReserve did not\nrecalculate any BHC\u2019s\nSCB in connection with\nthe December 18, 2020\nannouncement, it\nextended the time\nperiod to notify firms\nwhether their SCB\nrequirements will be\nrecalculated until\nMarch 31, 2021, and\nalso extended capital\naction supervisory\nrestrictions\napplicable to large\nBHCs into the first\nquarter of 2021 with\nmodifications to\npermit resumptions of\nshare repurchases.\nConsistent with these\nmodifications, on\nDecember 18, 2020, our\nBoard of Directors\nauthorized the\nrepurchases of\noutstanding common\nstock of up to $10\nbillion in 2021,\nsubject to limitations\non distributions from\nthe Federal Reserve.\nSee \u201cLiquidity and\nCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory\nRequirements\u2014Capital\nAction Supervisory\nRestrictions\u201d herein\nfor additional\ninformation on capital\naction supervisory\nrestrictions.\n\nFor the 2021 capital\nplanning and stress\ntest cycle, we are\nrequired to submit our\ncapital plan and\ncompany-run stress\ntest results to the\nFederal Reserve by\nApril 5, 2021.

In\nparticular, a firm\nmay, provided that it\ndoes not increase the\namount of its common\nstock dividends to be\nlarger than the level\npaid in the second\nquarter of 2020, pay\ncommon stock dividends\nand make share\nrepurchases that, in\nthe aggregate, do not\nexceed an amount equal\nto the average of the\nfirm\u2019s net income for\nthe four preceding\ncalendar quarters;\nmake share repurchases\nthat equal the amount\nof share issuances\nrelated to expensed\nemployee compensation;\nand redeem and make\nscheduled payments on\nadditional Tier 1 and\nTier 2 capital\ninstruments.\n\nAttribution of Average\nCommon Equity\nAccording to the\nRequired Capital\nFramework\n\nOur required capital\n(\u201cRequired Capital\u201d)\nestimation is based on\nthe Required Capital\nframework, an internal\ncapital adequacy\nmeasure.

The attribution of average common equity to\nthe business segments is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. See \"Selected Non-GAAP Financial\nInformation\" herein. 2. Total average common\nequity and the allocation to the Wealth\nManagement business segment were revised in\nthe fourth quarter of 2020 to reflect the\nimpact of the E*TRADE acquisition on October\n2, 2020. Beginning in 2021, we have updated\nour Required Capital framework to take into\naccount changes to our risk-based capital\nrequirements resulting from the SCB. The\nstand-alone impact of the change to the\nRequired Capital framework was not material to\nthe business segments. As noted above, common\nequity attribution to the business segments is\nbased upon usage. We will continue to evaluate\nthe framework with respect to the impact of\nother future regulatory requirements as\nappropriate. Resolution and Recovery Planning\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are\nrequired to periodically submit to the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that\ndescribes our strategy for a rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in\nthe event of our material financial distress\nor failure.

As described in our most recent\nresolution plan, which was submitted on June\n28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy is\nan SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE\nstrategy, the Parent Company has transferred,\nand has agreed to transfer on an ongoing\nbasis, certain assets to its wholly owned,\ndirect subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC\n(the \u201cFunding IHC\u201d). In addition, the Parent\nCompany has entered into an amended and\nrestated support agreement with its material\nentities (including the Funding IHC) and\ncertain other subsidiaries. In the event of a\nresolution scenario, the Parent Company would\nbe obligated to contribute all of its\nContributable Assets to our material entities\nand/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would\nbe obligated to provide capital and liquidity,\nas applicable, to our material entities. The\ncombined implication of the SPOE resolution\nstrategy and the requirement to maintain\ncertain levels of TLAC is that losses in\nresolution would be imposed on the holders of\neligible long-term debt and other forms of\neligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company\nbefore any losses are imposed on creditors of\nour material entities or before putting U.S.\ntaxpayers at risk.\n\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and the\nFunding IHC under the amended and restated\nsupport agreement are in most cases secured on\na senior basis by the assets of the Parent\nCompany (other than shares in subsidiaries of\nthe Parent Company and certain other assets)\nand the assets of the Funding IHC. As a\nresult, claims of our material entities,\nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the\nsecured assets, are effectively senior to\nunsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\nIn December 2019, we received joint feedback\non our 2019 resolution plan from the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC. The feedback confirmed\nthat there are no deficiencies in our 2019\nresolution plan and that we had successfully\naddressed a prior shortcoming identified by\nthe agencies in the review of our 2017\nresolution plan. The agencies noted one\nshortcoming in our 2019 resolution plan\nrelated to certain mechanisms intended to\nfacilitate our SPOE strategy which must be\naddressed prior to our next resolution plan\nsubmission in 2021.

Through\nthese facilities and programs, the Federal\nReserve has taken steps to directly or\nindirectly purchase assets or debt instruments\nfrom, or make loans to, U.S. companies,\nfinancial institutions, municipalities and\nother market participants. In the current\nyear, we have participated as principal, as\nwell as on behalf of clients, in certain of\nthese facilities and programs, and we may\nparticipate in other of these facilities and\nprograms in the future. In addition, the\nFederal Reserve has taken a range of other\nactions to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses. For example, the\nFederal Reserve has set the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25% and has\nincreased its holdings of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, purchased agency commercial\nmortgage-backed securities, and established a\nfacility to purchase corporate debt securities\nand shares of exchange-\n                                 \n  57    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \ntraded funds holding\nsuch securities. The\nFederal Reserve has\nalso encouraged\ndepository\ninstitutions to borrow\nfrom the discount\nwindow and has lowered\nthe primary credit\nrate for such\nborrowings by 150\nbasis points to 0.25%\nwhile extending the\nterm of such loans up\nto 90 days. In\naddition, reserve\nrequirements have been\nreduced to zero.\n\nActing in concert with\nthe other U.S. banking\nagencies, the Federal\nReserve has also\nissued statements\nencouraging banking\norganizations to use\ntheir capital and\nliquidity buffers as\nthey lend to\nhouseholds and\nbusinesses affected by\nCOVID-19.\n\nFurther, the Federal\nReserve, along with\nthe other U.S. banking\nagencies, issued\nguidance stating that\ngranting certain\nconcessions to\nborrowers that are\ncurrent on existing\nloans, either\nindividually or as\npart of a program for\ncreditworthy borrowers\nwho are experiencing\nshort-term financial\nor operational\nproblems as a result\nof the COVID-19\npandemic, generally\nwould not be\nconsidered TDRs under\napplicable U.S. GAAP.\nThis guidance also\nclarifies that efforts\nto work with borrowers\nof one-to-four family\nresidential mortgages\nimpacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and\nmeeting certain\ncriteria will not\nresult in such loans\nbeing deemed\nrestructured or\nmodified for purposes\nof regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nand other U.S. banking\nagencies have also\nissued a series of\nrulemakings in\nresponse to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding to\nfacilitate banking\norganizations\u2019 use of\ntheir capital buffers:\n\n\u2022 Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio Interim\nFinal Rules. The\nFederal Reserve has\nadopted an interim\nfinal rule that\nexcludes, on a\ntemporary basis, U.S.\nTreasury securities\nand deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks\nfrom our supplementary\nleverage exposure from\nApril 1, 2020 to March\n31, 2021.\n\nA similar interim\nfinal rule issued by\nthe OCC along with the\nother U.S. banking\nagencies provides\nnational banks,\nincluding MSBNA and\nMSPBNA, an optional\nelection, which is\nconsidered on a case-\nby-case basis by the\nOCC if received after\nJune 30, 2020, to\napply similar relief.\nIf elected and\napproved, a national\nbank must receive\nprior approval from\nthe OCC before making\nany capital\ndistributions while\nthe exclusion is in\neffect. As of December\n31, 2020, neither\nMSBNA nor MSPBNA made\nthis optional\nelection.\n\n\u2022 Revisions to\nDefinition of Eligible\nRetained Income. The\nU.S. banking agencies\nhave adopted as final\nan interim final rule,\nwhich was effective\nMarch 20, 2020,\namending the\ndefinition of eligible\nretained income in\ntheir respective\ncapital rules. As\namended, eligible\nretained income is\ndefined by the U.S.\nbanking agencies as\nthe greater of (i) net\nincome for the four\npreceding calendar\nquarters, net of any\ndistributions and\nassociated tax effects\nnot already reflected\nin net income, and\n(ii) the average of\nnet income over the\npreceding four\nquarters. This\ndefinition applies\n\nwith respect to any\npayout restrictions\napplicable in the\nevent of a breach of\nany regulatory capital\nbuffers, including any\napplicable CCyB, G-SIB\ncapital surcharge,\ncapital conservation\nbuffer, the enhanced\nSLR and the SCB, which\nreplaced the capital\nconservation buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach.\n\nSeparately, the\nFederal Reserve has\nadopted as final an\ninterim final rule,\nwhich was effective\nMarch 26, 2020,\namending the\ndefinition of eligible\nretained income under\nits TLAC rule to be\nconsistent with the\nrevised definition of\neligible retained\nincome in the\nregulatory capital\nframework, as\nsummarized above.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory Capital\nand Stress Testing\nDevelopments Related\nto Implementation of\nCECL. The U.S. banking\nagencies have adopted\na final rule,\nconsistent with an\ninterim final rule\nthat was effective\nMarch 31, 2020,\naltering, for purposes\nof the regulatory\ncapital and TLAC\nrequirements, the\nrequired adoption time\nperiod for CECL. We\nhave elected to apply\na transition method\nprovided by the rule,\nunder which the\neffects of CECL on our\nregulatory capital and\nTLAC requirements are\ndeferred for two\nyears, followed by a\nthree-year phase-in of\nthe aggregate capital\neffects of the two-\nyear deferral.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (the\n\u201cCARES Act\u201d) and the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act,\n2021 (the\n\u201cConsolidated\nAppropriations Act\u201d)\n\nThe CARES Act was\nsigned into law on\nMarch 27, 2020.\nPursuant to the CARES\nAct, the U.S. Treasury\nhad the authority to\nprovide loans,\nguarantees and other\ninvestments in support\nof eligible\nbusinesses, states and\nmunicipalities\naffected by the\neconomic effects of\nCOVID-19. Some of\nthese funds may also\nhave been used to\nsupport the several\nFederal Reserve\nprograms and\nfacilities described\nin \u201cFederal Reserve\nActions\u201d previously or\nadditional programs or\nfacilities that are\nestablished by the\nFederal Reserve under\nits Section 13(3)\nauthority and meet\ncertain criteria.\nAmong other\nprovisions, the CARES\nAct also included\nfunding for the Small\nBusiness\nAdministration to\nexpand lending, relief\nfrom certain U.S. GAAP\nrequirements to allow\nCOVID-19-related loan\nmodifications not to\nbe categorized as TDRs\nand a range of\nincentives to\nencourage deferment,\nforbearance or\nmodification of\nconsumer credit and\nmortgage contracts.\n\nThe CARES Act also\nincluded several\nmeasures that\ntemporarily adjusted\nexisting laws or\nregulations. These\nincluded providing the\nFDIC with additional\nauthority to guarantee\nthe deposits of\nsolvent insured\ndepository\ninstitutions held in\nnon-interest-bearing\nbusiness transaction\naccounts to a maximum\namount specified by\nthe FDIC, reinstating\nthe FDIC\u2019s Temporary\nLiquidity Guarantee\nAuthority to guarantee\ndebt obligations of\nsolvent insured\ndepository\ninstitutions or\ndepository institution\nholding companies,\ntemporarily allowing\nthe U.S. Treasury to\nfully guarantee money\nmarket mutual funds\nand granting\nadditional\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    58  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nauthority to the OCC\nto provide certain\nexemptions to the\nlending limits imposed\non national banks.\n\nThe Consolidated\nAppropriations Act,\nwhich was signed into\nlaw on December 27,\n2020, extends certain\nrelief provided by the\nCARES Act while also\nmodifying or\nclarifying certain\nother provisions.\nAmong other amendments\nto the CARES Act, the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act\nextends the relief\nrelated to TDRs until\nJanuary 1, 2022. In\naddition, the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act\nrescinds certain funds\nthat were appropriated\nto the U.S. Treasury\nto provide loans, loan\nguarantees, and make\nother investments in\nprograms or facilities\nestablished by the\nFederal Reserve, and\nprohibits the Federal\nReserve, after\nDecember 31, 2020,\nfrom making any new\ninvestments, loans or\nloan guarantees, or\nextensions of credit\nthrough those of its\nprograms and\nfacilities that were\nestablished using\nCARES Act funding.\nFederal Reserve\nprograms and\nfacilities that were\nnot established using\nCARES Act funding are\nnot affected by the\nConsolidated\nAppropriations Act.\n\nNon-U.S. Central Bank\nActions\n\nIn addition to actions\ntaken by the Federal\nReserve, many non-U.S.\ncentral banks have\nannounced similar\nfacilities and\nprograms in response\nto the economic and\nmarket disruptions\nassociated with\nCOVID-19. Firm\nsubsidiaries operating\nin non-U.S. markets\nmay participate, or\nperform customer\nfacilitation roles, in\nsuch non-U.S.\nfacilities or\nprograms.\n                                              \n  Other Matters                               \n                                              \n                                              \n  U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U.               \n                                              \nOn January 31, 2020,\nthe U.K. withdrew from\nthe E.U. under the\nterms of a withdrawal\nagreement between the\nU.K. and the E.U. The\nwithdrawal agreement\nprovided for a\ntransition period to\nthe end of December\n2020, during which\ntime the U.K.\ncontinued to apply\nE.U. law as if it were\na member state, and\nU.K. firms\u2019 rights to\nprovide financial\nservices in E.U.\nmember states\ncontinued.\n\nOn December 24, 2020\nthe U.K. and the E.U.\nannounced they had\nreached agreement on\nthe terms of a trade\nand co-operation\nagreement to govern\nthe future\nrelationship between\nthe parties. The\nagreement consists of\nthree main pillars\nincluding trade,\ncitizens\u2019 security and\ngovernance, covering a\nrange of arrangements\nin several areas. The\nagreement is\nprovisionally\napplicable with effect\nfrom January 1, 2021\npending formal\nratification by the\nE.U. As anticipated,\nthe agreement did not\nmaterially address\nprovision of financial\nservices.\n\nWe had prepared the\nstructure of our\nEuropean operations\nfor a range of\npotential outcomes,\nincluding for the\npossibility that U.K.\nfinancial firms\u2019\naccess to E.U. markets\nafter the transition\nperiod would be\nlimited, and have been\nable to continue to\nserve our clients and\ncustomers from January\n1, 2021.\n\nFor more information\non the U.K.\u2019s\nwithdrawal from the\nE.U., our related\npreparations and the\npotential impact on\nour operations, see\n\u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014International\nRisk.\u201d For further\ninformation regarding\nour exposure to the\nU.K., see also\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Country and Other\nRisks\u201d herein.\n\nPlanned Replacement of\nLondon Interbank\nOffered Rate and\nReplacement or Reform\nof Other Interest\nRates\n\nCentral banks around\nthe world, including\nthe Federal Reserve,\nhave commissioned\ncommittees and working\ngroups of market\nparticipants and\nofficial sector\nrepresentatives to\nreplace LIBOR and\nreplace or reform\nother interest rate\nbenchmarks\n(collectively, the\n\u201cIBORs\u201d). There\nremains a likelihood\nthat most IBORs will\nnot be available\nbeyond 2021. In 2020,\nICE Benchmark\nAdministration, which\nadministers LIBOR\npublication, issued a\nconsultation\nrequesting feedback on\nits intention to cease\nthe publication of\nmost LIBOR rates as of\nthe end of December\n2021, except for the\npublication until June\n30, 2023 of the most\nwidely used U.S.\ndollar LIBOR tenors.\nAt the same time, the\nU.S. banking agencies\nand the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority also\nencouraged banks to\ncease entering into\nnew contracts\nreferencing LIBOR as\nsoon as practicable\nand no later than\nDecember 31, 2021, but\nhave also indicated\ntheir support for the\ncontinuation of\ncertain U.S. dollar\nLIBOR tenors through\nthe end of June 2023\nto allow for certain\nU.S. dollar LIBOR\nlegacy contracts to\nmature.\n\nAlso in 2020, there\nhave been several\nsteps taken by the\nindustry to encourage\nthe transition to\nalternative reference\nrates. Key central\nclearinghouses, such\nas London Clearing\nHouse (\u201cLCH\u201d) and\nChicago Mercantile\nExchange (\u201cCME\u201d), have\nswitched their price\naligned interest and\ndiscounting to the\nalternative reference\nrates. For example,\nthe LCH and CME\ntransitioned the\ndiscounting rate for\nU.S. dollar\ndenominated products\nto SOFR, the\nalternative rate to\nU.S. dollar LIBOR\nselected by the ARRC.\nThe International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (\u201cISDA\u201d)\nalso published its\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol which will\namend ISDA\u2019s interest\nrate definitions among\nProtocol adherents to\nincorporate robust\nfallbacks for legacy\nnon-cleared\nderivatives linked to\nLIBOR and certain\nother interest rates\nbenchmarks. The ISDA\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol became\neffective as of\nJanuary 25, 2021 and\napplies to Protocol\nadherents who do not\nelect to voluntarily\nconvert their\nderivatives contracts\nto reference\nalternative rates in\nadvance of the\napplicable cessation\ndate. Similarly,\nISDA\u2019s IBOR Fallbacks\nSupplement will also\namend ISDA\u2019s standard\ndefinitions to\nincorporate these new\nfallbacks in new\nderivatives entered\ninto on or after that\nsame effective date.\nIn addition, certain\ncentral bank-sponsored\ncommittees have issued\nrecommended best\npractices to assist\nmarket participants in\ntransitioning away\nfrom the IBORs in\nvarious jurisdictions,\nincluding the United\nStates. These\ndocuments include\nrecommended timelines\nand intermediate steps\nmarket participants\ncan take in order to\nachieve a successful\ntransition.\n                                 \n  59    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                        \n  Table of Contents                     \n  Management's Discussion and Analysis  \n                                        \nWe have established\nand are undertaking a\nFirm-wide IBOR\ntransition plan to\npromote the transition\nto alternative\nreference rates, which\nis overseen by a\nglobal steering\ncommittee, with senior\nmanagement oversight.\nOur transition plan is\ndesigned to identify,\nassess and monitor\nrisks associated with\nthe expected\ndiscontinuation or\nunavailability of one\nor more of the IBORs,\nand includes continued\nengagement with\ncentral bank and\nindustry working\ngroups and regulators\n(including\nparticipation and\nleadership on key\ncommittees), active\nclient engagement,\ninternal operational\nreadiness and risk\nmanagement, among\nother things. We are a\nparty to a significant\nnumber of LIBOR-linked\ncontracts, many of\nwhich extend beyond\n2021 and, in the case\nof U.S. dollar LIBOR,\nJune 30, 2023,\ncomposed of\nderivatives,\nsecuritizations,\nfloating rate notes,\nloans and mortgages.\nOur review of these\ncontracts includes\nassessing the impact\nof applicable\nfallbacks and any\namendments that may be\nwarranted or\nappropriate. We are\nalso taking steps to\nupdate operational\nprocesses (including\nto support alternative\nreference rates),\nmodels, and associated\ninfrastructure, as\nwell as conducting\ncertain client\noutreach to amend\nfallbacks, including\nby utilization of the\nISDA 2020 IBOR\nFallbacks Protocol or\nthrough bilaterally\nnegotiated voluntary\nconversions of\noutstanding LIBOR\nproducts where\npracticable. Key Firm\nentities have also\nadhered to the ISDA\n2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol.\n\nIn addition, as part\nof the transition to\nalternative reference\nrates, we are making\nmarkets in products\nlinked to such rates,\nincluding SOFR, and\nhave issued debt\nlinked to SOFR.\n\nFor a further\ndiscussion of the\nexpected replacement\nof the IBORs and/or\nreform of interest\nrate benchmarks, and\nthe related risks and\nour transition plan,\nsee \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Legal,\nRegulatory and\nCompliance Risk.\u201d\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    60  \n                                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about\nRisk\n                                              \n  Risk Management                             \n                                              \n                                              \n   Overview                                   \n                                              \nRisk is an inherent\npart of our businesses\nand activities.

The\nprincipal risks\ninvolved in our\nbusiness activities\ninclude market\n(including non-trading\nrisks), credit,\noperational, model,\ncompliance,\ncybersecurity,\nliquidity, strategic,\nreputational and\nconduct risk.\nStrategic risk is\nintegrated into our\nbusiness planning,\nembedded in the\nevaluation of all\nprincipal risks and\noverseen by the Board.\n\nThe cornerstone of our\nrisk management\nphilosophy is the\npursuit of risk-\nadjusted returns\nthrough prudent risk\ntaking that protects\nour capital base and\nfranchise. This\nphilosophy is\nimplemented through\nthe ERM framework.\nFive key principles\nunderlie this\nphilosophy: integrity,\ncomprehensiveness,\nindependence,\naccountability and\ntransparency. To help\nensure the efficacy of\nrisk management, which\nis an essential\ncomponent of our\nreputation, senior\n\nmanagement requires\nthorough and frequent\ncommunication and the\nappropriate escalation\nof risk matters. The\nfast-paced, complex\nand constantly\nevolving nature of\nglobal financial\nmarkets requires us to\nmaintain a risk\nmanagement culture\nthat is incisive,\nknowledgeable about\nspecialized products\nand markets, and\nsubject to ongoing\nreview and\nenhancement.\n\nOur risk appetite\ndefines the types of\nrisk that the Firm is\nwilling to accept in\npursuit of our\nstrategic objectives\nand business plan,\ntaking into account\nthe interests of\nclients and fiduciary\nduties to\nshareholders, as well\nas capital and other\nregulatory\nrequirements. This\nrisk appetite is\nembedded in our risk\nculture and linked to\nour short-term and\nlong-term strategic,\ncapital and financial\nplans, as well as\ncompensation programs.\nThis risk appetite and\nthe related Board-\nlevel risk limits and\nrisk tolerance\nstatements are\nreviewed and approved\nby the Risk Committee\nof the Board (\u201cBRC\u201d)\nand the Board on at\nleast an annual basis.\n                                              \n  Risk Governance Structure                   \n                                              \nRisk management at the\nFirm requires\nindependent Firm-level\noversight,\naccountability of our\nbusiness divisions,\nand effective\ncommunication of risk\nmatters across the\nFirm, to senior\nmanagement and\nultimately to the\nBoard.

We are\ncommitted to\nreinforcing and\nconfirming adherence\nto our core values\nthrough our governance\nframework, tone from\nthe top, management\noversight, risk\nmanagement and\ncontrols, and three\nlines of defense\nstructure (business,\ncontrol functions such\nas Risk Management and\nCompliance, and\nInternal Audit).\n\nThe Board is\nresponsible for\noverseeing the Firm\u2019s\npractices and\nprocedures relating to\nculture, values and\nconduct, as set forth\nin the Firm\u2019s\nCorporate Governance\nPolicies. Our Culture,\nValues and Conduct\nCommittee, along with\nthe Compliance and\nConduct Risk\nCommittee, are the\nsenior management\ncommittees that\noversee the Firmwide\nculture, values and\nconduct program and\nreport regularly to\nthe Board. A\nfundamental building\nblock of this program\nis the Firm\u2019s Code of\nConduct, which\nestablishes standards\nfor employee conduct\nthat further reinforce\nthe Firm\u2019s commitment\nto integrity and\nethical conduct. Every\nnew hire and every\nemployee annually is\nrequired to certify to\ntheir understanding of\nand adherence to the\nCode of Conduct. The\nFirm\u2019s Global Conduct\nRisk Management Policy\nalso sets out a\nconsistent global\nframework for managing\nConduct Risk ( i.e. ,\nthe risk arising from\nmisconduct by\nemployees or\ncontingent workers)\nand Conduct Risk\nincidents at the Firm.\n\nThe employee annual\nperformance review\nprocess includes\nevaluation of employee\nconduct related to\nrisk management\npractices and the\nFirm\u2019s expectations.\nWe also have several\nmutually reinforcing\nprocesses to identify\nemployee conduct that\nmay have an impact on\nemployment status,\ncurrent year\ncompensation and/or\nprior year\ncompensation. For\nexample, the Global\nIncentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy sets\nforth standards for\nmanagers when making\nannual compensation\ndecisions and\nspecifically provides\nthat managers must\nconsider whether their\nemployees effectively\nmanaged and/or\nsupervised risk\ncontrol practices\nduring the performance\nyear. Management\ncommittees from\ncontrol functions\nperiodically meet to\ndiscuss employees\nwhose conduct is not\nin line with our\nexpectations. These\nresults are\nincorporated into\nidentified employees\u2019\nperformance reviews\nand compensation and\npromotion decisions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s clawback\nand cancellation\nprovisions apply to\ndeferred incentive\ncompensation and cover\na broad scope of\nemployee conduct,\nincluding any act or\nomission (including\nwith respect to direct\nsupervisory\nresponsibilities) that\n                                 \n  63    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nconstitutes a breach\nof obligation to the\nFirm or causes a\nrestatement of the\nFirm\u2019s financial\nresults, constitutes a\nviolation of the\nFirm\u2019s global risk\nmanagement principles,\npolicies and\nstandards, or causes a\nloss of revenue\nassociated with a\nposition on which the\nemployee was paid and\nthe employee operated\noutside of internal\ncontrol policies.\n                                              \n  Risk Limits Framework                       \n                                              \nRisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nprovide the basis for\nmonitoring risk taking\nactivity and avoiding\noutsized risk taking.\nOur risk-taking\ncapacity is sized\nthrough the Firm\u2019s\ncapital planning\nprocess where losses\nare estimated under\nthe Firm\u2019s BHC\nSeverely Adverse\nstress testing\nscenario. We also\nmaintain a\ncomprehensive suite of\nrisk limits and\nquantitative metrics\nto support and\nimplement our risk\nappetite statement.\nOur risk limits\nsupport linkages\nbetween the overall\nrisk appetite, which\nis reviewed by the\nBoard, and more\ngranular risk-taking\ndecisions and\nactivities.\n\nRisk limits, once\nestablished, are\nreviewed and updated\non at least an annual\nbasis, with more\nfrequent updates as\nnecessary. Board-level\nrisk limits address\nthe most important\nFirmwide aggregations\nof risk, including,\nbut not limited to,\nstressed market,\ncredit and liquidity\nrisks. Additional risk\nlimits approved by the\nFRC address more\nspecific types of risk\nand are bound by the\nhigher-level Board\nrisk limits.\n                                              \n   Risk Management Process                    \n                                              \nIn subsequent\nsections, we discuss\nour risk management\npolicies and\nprocedures for our\nprimary risks. This\ndiscussion primarily\nfocuses on our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment's trading\nactivities and\ncorporate lending and\nrelated activities. We\nbelieve that these\nactivities generate a\nsubstantial portion of\nour primary risks.\nThese sections and the\nestimated amounts of\nour risk exposure\ngenerated by our\nstatistical analyses\nare forward-looking\nstatements. However,\nthe analyses used to\nassess such risks are\nnot predictions of\nfuture events, and\nactual results may\nvary significantly\nfrom such analyses due\nto events in the\nmarkets in which we\noperate and certain\nother factors\ndescribed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n                                              \n  Market Risk                                 \n                                              \nMarket risk refers to\nthe risk that a change\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, spreads,\nindices, volatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity,\nwill result in losses\nfor a position or\nportfolio. Generally,\nwe incur market risk\nas a result of\ntrading, investing and\nclient facilitation\nactivities,\nprincipally within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment where the\nsubstantial majority\nof our VaR for market\nrisk exposures is\ngenerated. In\naddition, we incur\nnon-trading market\nrisk, principally\nwithin the Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segments. The\nWealth Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\n(including interest\nrate risk) from\nlending and deposit-\ntaking activities. The\n\nInvestment Management\nbusiness segment\nprimarily incurs non-\ntrading market risk\nfrom capital\ninvestments in\nalternative and other\nfunds.\n\nMarket risk also\nincludes non-trading\ninterest rate risk.\nNon-trading interest\nrate risk in the\nbanking book (amounts\nclassified for\nregulatory capital\npurposes under the\nbanking book regime)\nrefers to the exposure\nthat a change in\ninterest rates will\nresult in prospective\nearnings changes for\nassets and liabilities\nin the banking book.\n\nSound market risk\nmanagement is an\nintegral part of our\nculture. The various\nbusiness units and\ntrading desks are\nresponsible for\nensuring that market\nrisk exposures are\nwell-managed and\nprudent. The control\ngroups help ensure\nthat these risks are\nmeasured and closely\nmonitored and are made\ntransparent to senior\nmanagement. The Market\nRisk Department is\nresponsible for\nensuring the\ntransparency of\nmaterial market risks,\nmonitoring compliance\nwith established\nlimits and escalating\nrisk concentrations to\nappropriate senior\nmanagement.\n\nTo execute these\nresponsibilities, the\nMarket Risk Department\nmonitors our risk\nagainst limits on\naggregate risk\nexposures, performs a\nvariety of risk\nanalyses, routinely\nreports risk\nsummaries, and\nmaintains our VaR and\nscenario analysis\nsystems. Market risk\nis also monitored\nthrough various\nmeasures: by use of\nstatistics (including\nVaR and related\nanalytical measures);\nby measures of\nposition sensitivity;\nand through routine\nstress testing, which\nmeasures the impact on\nthe value of existing\nportfolios of\nspecified changes in\nmarket factors and\nscenarios designed by\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment in\ncollaboration with the\nbusiness units. The\nmaterial risks\nidentified by these\nprocesses are\nsummarized in reports\nproduced by the Market\nRisk Department that\nare circulated to and\ndiscussed with senior\nmanagement, the FRC,\nthe BRC and the Board.\n                                              \n  Trading Risks                               \n                                              \n                                              \n   Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market   \n   Risk Management                            \n                                              \nDuring 2020, we had\nexposures to a wide\nrange of interest\nrates, equity prices,\nforeign exchange rates\nand commodity\nprices\u2014and the\nassociated implied\nvolatilities and\nspreads\u2014related to the\nglobal markets in\nwhich we conduct our\ntrading activities.\n\nWe are exposed to\ninterest rate and\ncredit spread risk as\na result of our\nmarket-making\nactivities and other\ntrading in interest\nrate-sensitive\nfinancial instruments\n(i.e., risk arising\nfrom changes in the\nlevel or implied\nvolatility of interest\nrates, the timing of\nmortgage prepayments,\nthe shape of the yield\ncurve and/or credit\nspreads).

Commodity\nexposures are subject\nto periods of high\nprice volatility as a\nresult of changes in\nsupply and demand.\nThese changes can be\ncaused by weather\nconditions; physical\nproduction and\ntransportation; or\ngeopolitical and other\nevents that affect the\navailable supply and\nlevel of demand for\nthese commodities.\n\nWe manage our trading\npositions by employing\na variety of risk\nmitigation strategies.\nThese strategies\ninclude\ndiversification of\nrisk exposures and\nhedging. Hedging\nactivities consist of\nthe purchase or sale\nof positions in\nrelated securities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions). Hedging\nactivities may not\nalways provide\neffective mitigation\nagainst trading losses\ndue to differences in\nthe terms, specific\ncharacteristics or\nother basis risks that\nmay exist between the\nhedge instrument and\nthe risk exposure that\nis being hedged.\n\nWe manage the market\nrisk associated with\nour trading activities\non a Firmwide basis,\non a worldwide trading\ndivision level and on\nan individual product\nbasis. We manage and\nmonitor our market\nrisk exposures in such\na way as to maintain a\nportfolio that we\nbelieve is well-\ndiversified in the\naggregate with respect\nto market risk factors\nand that reflects our\naggregate risk\ntolerance as\nestablished by our\nsenior management.\n\nAggregate market risk\nlimits have been\napproved for the Firm\nacross all divisions\nworldwide. Additional\nmarket risk limits are\nassigned to trading\ndesks and, as\nappropriate, products\nand regions. Trading\ndivision risk\nmanagers, desk risk\nmanagers, traders and\nthe Market Risk\nDepartment monitor\nmarket risk measures\nagainst limits in\naccordance with\npolicies set by our\nsenior management.\n                                              \n  Value-at-Risk                               \n                                              \nThe statistical\ntechnique known as VaR\nis one of the tools we\nuse to measure,\nmonitor and review the\nmarket risk exposures\nof our trading\nportfolios. The Market\nRisk Department\ncalculates and\ndistributes daily VaR-\nbased risk measures to\nvarious levels of\nmanagement.\n\nWe estimate VaR using\na model based on a\none-year equal\nweighted historical\nsimulation for general\nmarket risk factors\nand name-specific risk\nin corporate shares\nand related\nderivatives, and Monte\nCarlo simulation for\nname-specific risk in\nbonds, loans and\nrelated derivatives.\nThe model constructs a\ndistribution of\nhypothetical daily\nchanges in the value\nof trading portfolios\nbased on historical\nobservation of daily\nchanges in key market\nindices or other\nmarket risk factors,\nand information on the\nsensitivity of the\nportfolio values to\nthese market risk\nfactor changes.\n\nVaR for risk\nmanagement purposes\n(\u201cManagement VaR\u201d) is\ncomputed at a 95%\nlevel of confidence\nover a one-day time\nhorizon, which is a\nuseful indicator of\npossible trading\nlosses resulting from\nadverse daily market\nmoves. The 95%/one-day\nVaR corresponds to the\nunrealized loss in\nportfolio value that,\nbased on historically\nobserved market risk\nfactor movements,\nwould have been\nexceeded with a\nfrequency of 5%, or\nfive times in every\n100 trading days, if\nthe portfolio were\nheld constant for one\nday.\n\nOur VaR model\ngenerally takes into\naccount linear and\nnon-linear exposures\nto equity and\ncommodity price risk,\ninterest rate risk,\ncredit spread risk and\nforeign exchange\nrates. The model also\ntakes into account\nlinear exposures to\nimplied volatility\nrisks for all asset\nclasses and non-linear\nexposures to implied\nvolatility risks for\nequity, commodity and\nforeign exchange\nreferenced products.\nThe VaR model also\ncaptures certain\nimplied correlation\nrisks associated with\nportfolio credit\nderivatives, as well\nas certain basis risks\n(e.g., corporate debt\nand related credit\nderivatives).\n\nWe use VaR as one of a\nrange of risk\nmanagement tools.\nAmong their benefits,\nVaR models permit\nestimation of a\nportfolio\u2019s aggregate\nmarket risk exposure,\nincorporating a range\nof varied market risks\nand portfolio assets.\nOne key element of the\nVaR model is that it\nreflects risk\nreduction due to\nportfolio\ndiversification or\nhedging activities.\nHowever, VaR has\nvarious limitations,\nwhich include, but are\nnot limited to: use of\nhistorical changes in\nmarket risk factors,\nwhich may not be\naccurate predictors of\nfuture market\nconditions and may not\nfully incorporate the\nrisk of extreme market\nevents that are\noutsized relative to\nobserved historical\nmarket behavior or\nreflect the historical\ndistribution of\nresults beyond the 95%\nconfidence interval;\nand reporting of\nlosses in a single\nday, which does not\nreflect the risk of\npositions that cannot\nbe liquidated or\nhedged in one day. A\nsmall proportion of\nmarket risk generated\nby trading positions\nis not included in\nVaR.\n                                 \n  65    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nThe modeling of the\nrisk characteristics\nof some positions\nrelies on\napproximations that,\nunder certain\ncircumstances, could\nproduce significantly\ndifferent results from\nthose produced using\nmore precise measures.\nVaR is most\nappropriate as a risk\nmeasure for trading\npositions in liquid\nfinancial markets and\nwill understate the\nrisk associated with\nsevere events, such as\nperiods of extreme\nilliquidity. We are\naware of these and\nother limitations and,\ntherefore, use VaR as\nonly one component in\nour risk management\noversight process.\nThis process also\nincorporates stress\ntesting and scenario\nanalyses and extensive\nrisk monitoring,\nanalysis and control\nat the trading desk,\ndivision and Firm\nlevels. Our VaR model\nevolves over time in\nresponse to changes in\nthe composition of\ntrading portfolios and\nto improvements in\nmodeling techniques\nand systems\ncapabilities. We are\ncommitted to\ncontinuous review and\nenhancement of VaR\nmethodologies and\nassumptions in order\nto capture evolving\nrisks associated with\nchanges in market\nstructure and\ndynamics. As part of\nour regular process\nimprovements,\nadditional systematic\nand name-specific risk\nfactors may be added\nto improve the VaR\nmodel\u2019s ability to\nmore accurately\nestimate risks to\nspecific asset classes\nor industry sectors.\nSince the reported VaR\nstatistics are\nestimates based on\nhistorical data, VaR\nshould not be viewed\nas predictive of our\nfuture revenues or\nfinancial performance\nor of our ability to\nmonitor and manage\nrisk. There can be no\nassurance that our\nactual losses on a\nparticular day will\nnot exceed the VaR\namounts indicated in\nthe following tables\nor that such losses\nwill not occur more\nthan five times in 100\ntrading days for a\n95%/one-day VaR. VaR\ndoes not predict the\nmagnitude of losses\nthat, should they\noccur, may be\nsignificantly greater\nthan the VaR amount.\nVaR statistics are not\nreadily comparable\nacross firms because\nof differences in the\nfirms\u2019 portfolios,\nmodeling assumptions\nand methodologies.\nThese differences can\nresult in materially\ndifferent VaR\nestimates across firms\nfor similar\nportfolios. The impact\nof such differences\nvaries depending on\nthe factor history\nassumptions, the\nfrequency with which\nthe factor history is\nupdated and the\nconfidence level. As a\nresult, VaR statistics\nare more useful when\ninterpreted as\nindicators of trends\nin a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile rather than as\nan absolute measure of\nrisk to be compared\nacross firms. Our\nregulators have\napproved the same VaR\nmodel we use for risk\nmanagement purposes\nfor use in regulatory\ncalculations. The\nportfolio of positions\nused for Management\nVaR differs from that\nused for Regulatory\nVaR.

We\nactively hedge our\nlending and\nderivatives exposures.\nHedging activities\nconsist of the\npurchase or sale of\npositions in related\nsecurities and\nfinancial instruments,\nincluding a variety of\nderivative products (\ne.g. , futures,\nforwards, swaps and\noptions).\nAdditionally, we may\nsell, assign or\nsyndicate loans and\nlending commitments to\nother financial\ninstitutions in the\nprimary and secondary\nloan markets. In\nconnection with our\nderivatives trading\nactivities, we\ngenerally enter into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral\narrangements with\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide us\nwith the ability to\ndemand collateral, as\nwell as to liquidate\ncollateral and offset\nreceivables and\npayables covered under\nthe same master\nagreement in the event\nof a counterparty\ndefault.

Beginning\nlate in the first\nquarter of 2020 and\nfollowing in part from\nthe U.S. government\u2019s\nenactment of the CARES\nAct, we have received\nrequests from certain\nclients for\nmodifications of their\ncredit agreements with\nus, which in some\ncases include deferral\nof their loan\npayments. Initial\nborrower requests for\nloan payment deferrals\nrelated to Residential\nreal estate loans are\ngranted, while those\nrelated to Commercial\nreal estate loans\nrequire careful\nconsideration prior to\napproval. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the\noutstanding principal\nbalance of loans with\napproved deferrals of\nprincipal and interest\npayments currently in\nplace which are not\nclassified as troubled\ndebt restructurings\namounted to\napproximately $400\nmillion for our\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment, primarily\nCommercial real estate\nloans, and\napproximately $400\nmillion for our Wealth\nManagement business\nsegment, primarily\ncommercial real\nestate-related\ntailored loans within\nSecurities-based\nlending and Other, and\nResidential real\nestate loans.\nIncremental to this\npopulation, throughout\n2020, we have provided\ndeferrals of principal\nand interest on\napproximately $2.7\nbillion of loans which\nhave now exited such\nmodification\narrangements. The\nsubstantial majority\nof these loans are\ncurrent as of December\n31, 2020. In addition\nto these principal and\ninterest deferrals, we\nare working with\nclients regarding\nmodifications of\ncertain other terms\nunder their original\nloan agreements that\ndo not impact\ncontractual loan\npayments. We have\ngranted such relief to\ncertain borrowers,\nprimarily within\nSecured lending\nfacilities and\nCorporate loans. Such\nmodifications include\nagreements to modify\nmargin calls for\nSecured lending\nfacilities, typically\nin return for\nadditional payments\nthat improve LTV\nratios. In some cases,\nwe have agreed to\ntemporarily not\nenforce certain\ncovenants, for example\ndebt or interest\ncoverage ratios,\ntypically in return\nfor other structural\nenhancements. Granting\nloan deferral or\nmodification requests\ndoes not necessarily\nmean that we will\nincur credit losses,\nand we do not believe\nmodifications have had\na material impact on\nthe risk profile of\nour loan portfolio.\nModifications are\nconsidered in our\nevaluation of overall\ncredit risk.\nGenerally, loans with\npayment deferrals\nremain on accrual\nstatus, and loans with\nother modifications\nremain on current\nstatus. Requests for\ndeferrals and other\nmodifications could\ncontinue in future\nperiods given the\nongoing uncertain\nglobal economic and\nmarket conditions.

In 2020, the\nprovision for loan\nlosses was $559\nmillion, and the\nprovision for losses\non lending commitments\nwas $203 million.\nCredit exposure\narising from our loans\nand lending\ncommitments is\nmeasured in accordance\nwith our internal risk\nmanagement standards.\nRisk factors\nconsidered in\ndetermining the\naggregate allowance\nfor loan and\ncommitment losses\ninclude the borrower\u2019s\nfinancial strength,\nindustry, facility\nstructure, LTV ratio,\ndebt service ratio,\ncollateral and\ncovenants. Qualitative\nand environmental\nfactors such as\neconomic and business\nconditions, nature and\nvolume of the\nportfolio and lending\nterms, and volume and\nseverity of past due\nloans may also be\nconsidered. The\naggregate allowance\nfor loans and lending\ncommitment losses\nincreased in 2020,\nreflecting the\nprovision for credit\nlosses within the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment principally\nresulting from the\ncontinued economic\nimpact of COVID-19,\npartially offset by\ncharge-offs. The\nprovision was\nprimarily the result\nof actual and\nforecasted changes in\nasset quality trends,\nas well as risks\nrelated to uncertainty\nin the outlook for the\nsectors in focus due\nto COVID-19. Charge-\noffs in 2020 were\nprimarily related to\ncertain Commercial\nreal estate and\nCorporate loans in the\nInstitutional\nSecurities business\nsegment.

These\ncredit lines are\nprimarily uncommitted\nloan facilities, as we\nreserve the right to\nnot make any advances\nor may terminate these\ncredit lines at any\ntime.

Counterparty credit\nratings are determined\ninternally by CRM. We\nare exposed to credit\nrisk as a dealer in\nOTC derivatives.\nCredit risk with\nrespect to derivative\ninstruments arises\nfrom the possibility\nthat a counterparty\nmay fail to perform\naccording to the terms\nof the contract. For a\ndescription of our\nrisk mitigation\nstrategies, see\n\u201cCredit Risk\u2014Risk\nMitigation\u201d herein. In\n2020, our exposure to\ncredit risk arising\nfrom OTC derivatives\nhas increased,\nprimarily as a\nfunction of the effect\nof market factors and\nvolatility on the\nvaluation of our\npositions, although\nexposure has declined\nsince peaking in March\n2020. Credit\nDerivatives A credit\nderivative is a\ncontract between a\nseller and buyer of\nprotection against the\nrisk of a credit event\noccurring on one or\nmore debt obligations\nissued by a specified\nreference entity. The\nbuyer typically pays a\nperiodic premium over\nthe life of the\ncontract and is\nprotected for the\nperiod. If a credit\nevent occurs, the\nseller is required to\nmake payment to the\nbeneficiary based on\nthe terms of the\ncredit derivative\ncontract. Credit\nevents, as defined in\nthe contract, may be\none or more of the\nfollowing defined\nevents: bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay,\nobligation\nacceleration,\nrepudiation, payment\nmoratorium and\nrestructuring. We\ntrade in a variety of\ncredit derivatives and\nmay either purchase or\nwrite protection on a\nsingle name or\nportfolio of\nreferenced entities.\nIn transactions\nreferencing a\nportfolio of entities\nor securities,\nprotection may be\nlimited to a tranche\nof exposure or a\nsingle name within the\nportfolio. We are an\nactive market maker in\nthe credit derivatives\nmarkets. As a market\nmaker, we work to earn\na bid-offer spread on\nclient flow business\nand manage any\nresidual credit or\ncorrelation risk on a\nportfolio basis.\nFurther, we use credit\nderivatives to manage\nour exposure to\nresidential and\ncommercial mortgage\nloans and corporate\nlending exposures.

As with all\nderivative contracts,\nwe consider\ncounterparty credit\nrisk in the valuation\nof our positions and\nrecognize CVAs as\nappropriate within\nTrading revenues in\nthe income statements.\nFor additional credit\nexposure information\non our credit\nderivative portfolio,\nsee Note 7 to the\nfinancial statements.\nCountry Risk Country\nrisk exposure is the\nrisk that events in,\nor that affect, a\nforeign country (any\ncountry other than the\nU.S.) might adversely\naffect us. We actively\nmanage country risk\nexposure through a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement framework\nthat combines credit\nand market\nfundamentals and\nallows us to\neffectively identify,\nmonitor and limit\ncountry risk. Our\nobligor credit\nevaluation process may\nalso identify indirect\nexposures, whereby an\nobligor has\nvulnerability or\nexposure to another\ncountry or\njurisdiction. Examples\nof indirect exposures\ninclude mutual funds\nthat invest in a\nsingle country,\noffshore companies\nwhose assets reside in\nanother country to\nthat of the offshore\njurisdiction and\nfinance company\nsubsidiaries of\ncorporations. Indirect\nexposures identified\nthrough the credit\nevaluation process may\nresult in a\nreclassification of\ncountry risk. We\nconduct periodic\nstress testing that\nseeks to measure the\nimpact on our credit\nand market exposures\nof shocks stemming\nfrom negative economic\nor political\nscenarios. When deemed\nappropriate by our\nrisk managers, the\nstress test scenarios\ninclude possible\ncontagion effects and\nsecond order risks.\nThis analysis, and\nresults of the stress\ntests, may result in\nthe amendment of\nlimits or exposure\nmitigation. Our\nsovereign exposures\nconsist of financial\ncontracts and\nobligations entered\ninto with sovereign\nand local governments.\nOur non-sovereign\nexposures consist of\nfinancial contracts\nand obligations\nentered into primarily\nwith corporations and\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Index\ncredit derivatives are\nincluded in the\nfollowing country risk\nexposure table. Each\nreference entity\nwithin an index is\nallocated to that\nreference entity\u2019s\ncountry of risk. Index\nexposures are\nallocated to the\nunderlying reference\nentities in proportion\nto the notional\nweighting of each\nreference entity in\nthe index, adjusted\nfor any fair value\nreceivable or payable\n\nfor that reference\nentity. Where credit\nrisk crosses multiple\njurisdictions, for\nexample, a CDS\npurchased from an\nissuer in a specific\ncountry that\nreferences bonds\nissued by an entity in\na different country,\nthe fair value of the\nCDS is reflected in\nthe Net Counterparty\nExposure row based on\nthe country of the CDS\nissuer. Further, the\nnotional amount of the\nCDS adjusted for the\nfair value of the\nreceivable or payable\nis reflected in the\nNet Inventory row\nbased on the country\nof the underlying\nreference entity.

We may incur\noperational risk\nacross the full scope\nof our business\nactivities, including\nrevenue-generating\nactivities ( e.g. ,\nsales and trading) and\nsupport and control\ngroups ( e.g. ,\ninformation technology\nand trade processing).\nWe have established an\noperational risk\nframework to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and\ncontrol risk across\nthe Firm. Effective\noperational risk\nmanagement is\nessential to reducing\nthe impact of\noperational risk\nincidents and\nmitigating legal,\nregulatory and\nreputational risks.\nThe framework is\ncontinually evolving\nto account for changes\nin the Firm and to\nrespond to the\nchanging regulatory\nand business\nenvironment. We have\nimplemented\noperational risk data\nand assessment systems\nto monitor and analyze\ninternal and external\noperational risk\nevents, to assess\nbusiness environment\nand internal control\nfactors, and to\nperform scenario\nanalysis. The\ncollected data\nelements are\nincorporated in the\noperational risk\ncapital model. The\nmodel encompasses both\nquantitative and\nqualitative elements.\nInternal loss data and\nscenario analysis\nresults are direct\ninputs to the capital\nmodel, while\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    76  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of ContentsRisk Disclosures           \n                                              \nexternal operational\nincidents, business\nenvironment and\ninternal control\nfactors are evaluated\nas part of the\nscenario analysis\nprocess.\n\nIn addition, we employ\na variety of risk\nprocesses and\nmitigants to manage\nour operational risk\nexposures. These\ninclude a governance\nframework, a\ncomprehensive risk\nmanagement program and\ninsurance. Operational\nrisks and associated\nrisk exposures are\nassessed relative to\nthe risk tolerance\nreviewed and confirmed\nby the Board and are\nprioritized\naccordingly.\n\nThe breadth and range\nof operational risk\nare such that the\ntypes of mitigating\nactivities are wide-\nranging. Examples of\nactivities include:\ncontinuous enhancement\nof defenses against\ncyber attacks; use of\nlegal agreements and\ncontracts to transfer\nand/or limit\noperational risk\nexposures; due\ndiligence;\nimplementation of\nenhanced policies and\nprocedures; technology\nchange management\ncontrols; exception\nmanagement processing\ncontrols; and\nsegregation of duties.\n\nPrimary responsibility\nfor the management of\noperational risk is\nwith the business\nsegments, the control\ngroups and the\nbusiness managers\ntherein. The business\nmanagers maintain\nprocesses and controls\ndesigned to identify,\nassess, manage,\nmitigate and report\noperational risk. Each\nof the business\nsegments has a\ndesignated operational\nrisk coordinator. The\noperational risk\ncoordinator regularly\nreviews operational\nrisk issues and\nreports to our senior\nmanagement within each\nbusiness. Each control\ngroup also has a\ndesignated operational\nrisk coordinator and a\nforum for discussing\noperational risk\nmatters with our\nsenior management.\nOversight of\noperational risk is\nprovided by the\nOperational Risk\nOversight Committee,\nlegal entity risk\ncommittees, regional\nrisk committees and\nsenior management.

Of the\nidentified intangible\nassets acquired, the\nmost significant were\nthe customer\nrelationship\nintangible assets of\n$2.8 billion.\nManagement, with the\nassistance of a\nvaluation specialist,\nestimated the fair\nvalue of customer\nrelationship\nintangible assets\nusing the income\napproach, which\ndetermines the fair\nvalue as the present\nvalue of forecasted\n\nfuture cash flows. The\ndetermination of fair\nvalue of the assets\ninvolves significant\nestimates and\nassumptions related to\nforecasted future cash\nflows and the\nselection of the\nrespective discount\nrate.\n\nWe identified the\nvaluation of customer\nrelationship\nintangible assets as a\ncritical audit matter\nbecause the fair value\ndetermination requires\nmanagement to make\nsignificant estimates\nand assumptions in\ndetermining the\nforecasted future cash\nflows including\nrevenue growth rates\nand attrition rates as\nwell as the selection\nof the discount rate.\nPerforming audit\nprocedures to evaluate\nthe reasonableness of\nthese estimates and\nassumptions required a\nhigh degree of auditor\njudgment and an\nincreased extent of\neffort, including the\ninvolvement of our\nvaluation specialists.\n\nHow the Critical Audit\nMatter Was Addressed\nin the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures\nrelated to the\nvaluation of customer\nrelationship\nintangible assets\nacquired as part of\nthe E*TRADE\nacquisition included\nthe following, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 We tested the\noperating\neffectiveness of\ninternal controls over\nthe valuation\nmethodology used, the\ndetermination of\nforecasted future cash\nflows, and the\nselection of the\ndiscount rate.\n\n\u2022 We assessed the\nknowledge, skill,\nability and\nobjectivity of\nmanagement\u2019s valuation\nspecialist and\nevaluated the work\nperformed.\n\n\u2022 We evaluated the\nappropriateness of the\nvaluation methodology\nused and the\nreasonableness of the\nforecasted future cash\nflows for each\nselected customer\nrelationship\nintangible asset,\nspecifically the\nassumptions relating\nto revenue growth and\nattrition rates, as\nwell as whether the\nassumptions used were\nreasonable considering\nexternal market and\nindustry data as well\nas the past\nperformance of\nE*TRADE. We also\nperformed sensitivity\nanalyses to evaluate\nthe impact of changes\nin assumptions to the\nvaluation of the\ncustomer relationship\nintangible assets.\n\n\u2022 We tested the

Introduction and Basis of Presentation   \n                                              \nThe Firm Morgan\nStanley is a global\nfinancial services\nfirm that maintains\nsignificant market\npositions in each of\nits business\nsegments\u2014Institutional\nSecurities, Wealth\nManagement and\nInvestment Management.\nMorgan Stanley,\nthrough its\nsubsidiaries and\naffiliates, provides a\nwide variety of\nproducts and services\nto a large and\ndiversified group of\nclients and customers,\nincluding\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and\nindividuals. Unless\nthe context otherwise\nrequires, the terms\n\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d or\nthe \u201cFirm\u201d mean Morgan\nStanley (the \u201cParent\nCompany\u201d) together\nwith its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. See the\n\u201cGlossary of Common\nTerms and Acronyms\u201d\nfor the definition of\ncertain terms and\nacronyms used\nthroughout this Form\n10-K. A description of\nthe clients and\nprincipal products and\nservices of each of\nthe Firm\u2019s business\nsegments is as\nfollows: Institutional\nSecurities provides\ninvestment banking,\nsales and trading,\nlending and other\nservices to\ncorporations,\ngovernments, financial\ninstitutions and high\nto ultra-high net\nworth clients.\nInvestment banking\nservices consist of\ncapital raising and\nfinancial advisory\nservices, including\nservices relating to\nthe underwriting of\ndebt, equity and other\nsecurities, as well as\nadvice on mergers and\nacquisitions,\nrestructurings, real\nestate and project\nfinance. Sales and\ntrading services\ninclude sales,\nfinancing, prime\nbrokerage and market-\nmaking activities in\nthe equity and fixed\nincome businesses.\nLending activities\ninclude originating\ncorporate loans and\ncommercial real estate\nloans, providing\nsecured lending\nfacilities, and\nextending financing to\nsales and trading\ncustomers. Other\nactivities include\nAsia wealth management\nservices, investments\nand research. Wealth\nManagement provides a\ncomprehensive array of\nfinancial services and\nsolutions to\nindividual investors\nand small to medium-\nsized businesses and\ninstitutions covering:\nfinancial advisor-led\nbrokerage and\ninvestment advisory\nservices; self-\ndirected brokerage\nservices, including\nthrough the E*TRADE\nplatform; financial\nand wealth planning\nservices; workplace\nservices including\nstock plan\nadministration;\nannuity and insurance\nproducts; securities-\nbased lending,\nresidential real\nestate loans and other\nlending products;\nbanking; and\nretirement plan\nservices. Investment\nManagement provides a\nbroad range of\ninvestment strategies\nand products that span\ngeographies, asset\nclasses, and public\nand private markets to\na diverse group of\nclients across\ninstitutional and\nintermediary channels.\nStrategies and\nproducts, which are\noffered through a\nvariety of investment\nvehicles, include\nequity, fixed income,\nliquidity and\nalternative/other\nproducts.\nInstitutional clients\ninclude defined\nbenefit/defined\ncontribution plans,\nfoundations,\nendowments, government\n\nentities, sovereign\nwealth funds,\ninsurance companies,\nthird-party fund\nsponsors and\ncorporations.\nIndividual clients are\ngenerally served\nthrough\nintermediaries,\nincluding affiliated\nand non-affiliated\ndistributors. Basis of\nFinancial Information\nThe financial\nstatements are\nprepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, which\nrequires the Firm to\nmake estimates and\nassumptions regarding\nthe valuations of\ncertain financial\ninstruments, the\nvaluations of goodwill\nand intangible assets,\nthe outcome of legal\nand tax matters,\ndeferred tax assets,\nACL, and other matters\nthat affect its\nfinancial statements\nand related\ndisclosures. The Firm\nbelieves that the\nestimates utilized in\nthe preparation of its\nfinancial statements\nare prudent and\nreasonable. Actual\nresults could differ\nmaterially from these\nestimates. Certain\nreclassifications have\nbeen made to prior\nperiods to conform to\nthe current\npresentation. The\nNotes are an integral\npart of the Firm's\nfinancial statements.\nThe Firm has evaluated\nsubsequent events for\nadjustment to or\ndisclosure in these\nfinancial statements\nthrough the date of\nthis report and has\nnot identified any\nrecordable or\ndisclosable events not\notherwise reported in\nthese financial\nstatements or the\nnotes thereto.\nConsolidation The\nfinancial statements\ninclude the accounts\nof the Firm, its\nwholly owned\nsubsidiaries and other\nentities in which the\nFirm has a controlling\nfinancial interest,\nincluding certain VIEs\n(see Note 16).\nIntercompany balances\nand transactions have\nbeen eliminated. For\nconsolidated\nsubsidiaries that are\nnot wholly owned, the\nthird-party holdings\nof equity interests\nare referred to as\nNoncontrolling\ninterests. The net\nincome attributable to\nNoncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as Net\nincome applicable to\nnoncontrolling\ninterests in the\nincome statements. The\nportion of\nshareholders\u2019 equity\nthat is attributable\nto noncontrolling\ninterests for such\nsubsidiaries is\npresented as\nnoncontrolling\ninterests, a component\nof Total equity, in\nthe balance sheets.\nFor entities where the\ntotal equity\ninvestment at risk is\nsufficient to enable\nthe entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional\nsubordinated financial\nsupport and the equity\nholders bear the\nresidual economic\nrisks and returns of\nthe entity and have\nthe power to direct\nthe activities of the\nentity that most\nsignificantly affect\nits economic\nperformance, the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities it controls\neither through a\nmajority voting\ninterest or otherwise.\nFor VIEs ( i.e. ,\nentities that do not\nmeet the\naforementioned\ncriteria), the Firm\nconsolidates those\nentities where it has\nthe power to make the\ndecisions that most\nsignificantly affect\nthe economic\nperformance of the VIE\nand has the obligation\nto absorb losses or\nthe right to receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be\nsignificant to the\nVIE.\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    86  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nFor investments in\nentities in which the\nFirm does not have a\ncontrolling financial\ninterest but has\nsignificant influence\nover operating and\nfinancial decisions,\nit applies the equity\nmethod of accounting\nwith net gains and\nlosses recorded within\nOther revenues (see\nNote 12) unless the\nFirm has elected to\nmeasure the investment\nat fair value, in\nwhich case net gains\nand losses are\nrecorded within\nInvestments revenues\n(see Note 5). Equity\nand partnership\ninterests held by\nentities qualifying\nfor accounting\npurposes as investment\ncompanies are carried\nat fair value. The\nFirm\u2019s significant\nregulated U.S. and\ninternational\nsubsidiaries include:\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley & Co.\nLLC (\u201cMS&Co.\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Smith\nBarney LLC (\u201cMSSB\u201d), \u2022\nMorgan Stanley Europe\nSE (\u201cMSESE\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley & Co.\nInternational plc\n(\u201cMSIP\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cMSBNA\u201d), \u2022 Morgan\nStanley Private Bank,\nNational Association\n(\u201cMSPBNA\u201d), \u2022 E*TRADE\nBank (\u201cETB\u201d), \u2022\nE*TRADE Savings Bank\n(\u201cETSB\u201d) and \u2022 E*TRADE\nSecurities LLC\n                                              \n  2.

Advisory\nfees are recognized as\nadvice is provided to\nthe client, based on\nthe estimated progress\nof work and when\nrevenues are not\nprobable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nAdvisory costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems, including those\nreimbursed.\nCommissions and Fees\nCommission and fee\nrevenues generally\nresult from\ntransaction-based\narrangements in which\nthe client is charged\na fee for the\nexecution of\ntransactions. Such\nrevenues\n\nprimarily arise from\ntransactions in equity\nsecurities; services\nrelated to sales and\ntrading activities;\nand sales of mutual\nfunds, alternative\nfunds, futures,\ninsurance products and\noptions, as well as\nrevenues from order\nflow payments for\ndirecting customer\norders to broker-\ndealers, exchanges,\nand market centers for\nexecution. Commission\nand fee revenues are\nrecognized on trade\ndate when the\nperformance obligation\nis satisfied. Asset\nManagement Revenues\nAsset management,\ndistribution and\nadministration fees\nare generally based on\nrelated asset levels\nbeing managed, such as\nthe AUM of a\ncustomer\u2019s account or\nthe net asset value of\na fund. These fees are\ngenerally recognized\nwhen services are\nperformed and the fees\nbecome known.\nManagement fees are\nreduced by estimated\nfee waivers and\nexpense caps, if any,\nprovided to the\ncustomer. Performance-\nbased fees not in the\nform of carried\ninterest are recorded\nwhen the annual\nperformance target is\nmet and the revenues\nare not probable of a\nsignificant reversal.\nSales commissions paid\nby the Firm in\nconnection with the\nsale of certain\nclasses of shares of\nits open-end mutual\nfund products are\naccounted for as\ndeferred commission\nassets and amortized\nto expense over the\nexpected life of the\ncontract. The Firm\nperiodically tests\ndeferred commission\nassets for\nrecoverability based\non cash flows expected\nto be received in\nfuture periods. Other\nasset management and\ndistribution costs are\nrecognized as incurred\nin the relevant non-\ninterest expenses line\nitems. Carried\nInterest The Firm is\nentitled to receive\nperformance-based fees\nin the form of carried\ninterest when the\nreturn in certain\nfunds exceeds\nspecified performance\ntargets. When the Firm\nearns carried interest\nfrom funds as\nspecified performance\nthresholds are met,\nthat carried interest\nand any related\ngeneral or limited\npartner interest is\naccounted for under\nthe equity method of\naccounting and\nmeasured based on the\nFirm\u2019s claim on the\nNAV of the fund at the\nreporting date, taking\ninto account the\ndistribution terms\napplicable to the\ninterest held. See\nNote 23 for\ninformation regarding\nthe net cumulative\nunrealized amount of\nperformance-based fee\nrevenues at risk of\nreversal. See Note 15\nfor information\nregarding general\npartner guarantees,\nwhich include\npotential obligations\nto return performance\nfee distributions\npreviously received.\nOther Items Revenues\nfrom certain\ncommodities-related\ncontracts are\nrecognized as the\npromised goods or\nservices are delivered\nto the customer.\nReceivables from\ncontracts with\ncustomers are\nrecognized in Customer\nand other receivables\nin the balance sheets\nwhen\n                                 \n  87    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthe underlying performance obligations have\nbeen satisfied and the Firm has the right per\nthe contract to bill the customer. Contract\nassets are recognized in Other assets when the\nFirm has satisfied its performance obligations\nbut customer payment is conditional. Contract\nliabilities are recognized in Other\nliabilities when the Firm has collected\npayment from a customer based on the terms of\nthe contract, but the underlying performance\nobligations are not yet satisfied. For\ncontracts with a term of less than one year,\nincremental costs to obtain the contract are\nexpensed as incurred. Revenues are not\ndiscounted when payment is expected within one\nyear. The Firm generally presents, net within\nrevenues, taxes assessed by a governmental\nauthority that are both imposed on and\nconcurrent with a specific revenue-producing\ntransaction and collected by the Firm from a\ncustomer. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nInstruments within Trading assets and Trading\nliabilities are measured at fair value, either\nas required or allowed by accounting guidance.\nThese financial instruments primarily\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s trading and investment\npositions and include both cash and derivative\nproducts. In addition, securities classified\nas AFS are measured at fair value. Gains and\nlosses on instruments carried at fair value\nare reflected in Trading revenues, Investments\nrevenues or Investment banking revenues in the\nincome statements, except for AFS securities\n(see \u201cAvailable-for-Sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) Investment\nSecurities\u201d section herein and Note 8) and\nderivatives accounted for as hedges (see\n\u201cHedge Accounting\u201d herein and Note 7).\nInterest income and interest expense are\nrecorded within the income statements\ndepending on the nature of the instrument and\nrelated market conventions. When interest is\nincluded as a component of the instruments\u2019\nfair value, interest is recorded within\nTrading revenues or Investments revenues.\nOtherwise, it is recorded within Interest\nincome or Interest expense. Dividend income is\nrecorded in Trading revenues or Investments\nrevenues depending on the business activity.\nThe fair value of OTC financial instruments,\nincluding derivative contracts related to\nfinancial instruments and commodities, is\npresented in the accompanying balance sheets\non a net-by-counterparty basis, when\nappropriate. Additionally, the Firm nets the\nfair value of cash collateral paid or received\nagainst the fair value amounts recognized for\nnet derivative positions executed with the\nsame counterparty under the same master\nnetting agreement. Fair Value Option The Firm\nhas elected to measure certain eligible\ninstruments at fair value, including\nSecurities purchased under agreements to\nresell, Loans and lending commitments, equity\nmethod investments and certain other assets,\nDeposits, Securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, Other secured financings and\nBorrowings. Fair Value Measurement\u2014Definition\nand Hierarchy Fair value is defined as the\nprice that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability ( i.e., the\n\u201cexit price\u201d) in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement\ndate. Fair value is a market-based measure\nconsidered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific\nmeasure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available,\nassumptions are set to reflect those that the\nFirm believes market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability at the\nmeasurement date. Where the Firm manages a\ngroup of financial assets, financial\nliabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted\nfor as derivatives on the basis of its net\nexposure to either market risks or credit\nrisk, the Firm measures the fair value of that\ngroup of financial instruments consistently\nwith how market participants would price the\nnet risk exposure at the measurement date. In\ndetermining fair value, the Firm uses various\nvaluation approaches and establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue that requires the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are\ninputs that market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability that were\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from\nsources independent of the Firm. Unobservable\ninputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the\nFirm believes other market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability that are\ndeveloped based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value\nhierarchy is broken down into three levels\nbased on the observability of inputs as\nfollows, with Level 1 being the highest and\nLevel 3 being the lowest level: Level 1.\nValuations based on quoted prices in active\nmarkets that the Firm has the ability to\naccess for identical assets or liabilities.\nValuation adjustments, block discounts and\ndiscounts for entity-specific restrictions\nthat would not transfer to market participants\nare not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since\nvaluations are based on quoted prices that are\nreadily and regularly available in an active\nmarket, valuation of these products does not\nentail a significant degree of judgment. Level\n2. Valuations based on one or more quoted\nprices in markets that are not active or for\nwhich all significant inputs are observable,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 3.\nValuations based on inputs that are\nunobservable and significant to the overall\nfair value measurement. The availability of\nobservable inputs can vary from product to\nproduct and is affected by a wide variety of\nfactors, including\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    88  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthe type of product, whether the product is\nnew and not yet established in the\nmarketplace, the liquidity of markets and\nother characteristics particular to the\nproduct. To the extent that valuation is based\non models or inputs that are less observable\nor unobservable in the market, the\ndetermination of fair value requires more\njudgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment\nexercised by the Firm in determining fair\nvalue is greatest for instruments categorized\nin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The\nFirm considers prices and inputs that are\ncurrent as of the measurement date, including\nduring periods of market dislocation. In\nperiods of market dislocation, the\nobservability of prices and inputs may be\nreduced for many instruments. This condition\ncould cause an instrument to be reclassified\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair\nvalue may fall into different levels of the\nfair value hierarchy. In such cases, the total\nfair value amount is disclosed in the level\nappropriate for the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the total fair value of the\nasset or liability. Valuation Techniques Many\ncash instruments and OTC derivative contracts\nhave bid and ask prices that can be observed\nin the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the\nhighest price that a party is willing to pay\nfor an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest\nprice that a party is willing to accept for an\nasset. The Firm carries positions at the point\nwithin the bid-ask range that meets its best\nestimate of fair value. For offsetting\npositions in the same financial instrument,\nthe same price within the bid-ask spread is\nused to measure both the long and short\npositions. Fair value for many cash\ninstruments and OTC derivative contracts is\nderived using pricing models. Pricing models\ntake into account the contract terms, as well\nas multiple inputs, including, where\napplicable, commodity prices, equity prices,\ninterest rate yield curves, credit curves,\ncorrelation, creditworthiness of the\ncounterparty, creditworthiness of the Firm,\noption volatility and currency rates. Where\nappropriate, valuation adjustments are made to\naccount for various factors such as liquidity\nrisk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality,\nmodel uncertainty and concentration risk and\nfunding. Adjustments for liquidity risk adjust\nmodel-derived mid-market amounts of Level 2\nand Level 3 financial instruments for the bid-\nmid or mid-ask spread required to properly\nreflect the exit price of a risk position.\nBid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to\nlevels observed in trade activity, broker\nquotes or other external third-party data.\nWhere these spreads are unobservable for the\nparticular position in question, spreads are\nderived from observable levels of similar\npositions. The Firm applies credit-related\nvaluation adjustments to its Borrowings for\nwhich the fair value option was elected and to\nOTC derivatives. The Firm considers the impact\nof changes in its own credit spreads based\nupon observations of the secondary bond market\nspreads when measuring the fair value for\nBorrowings. For OTC derivatives, the impact of\nchanges in both the Firm\u2019s and the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating is considered\nwhen measuring fair value. In determining the\nexpected exposure, the Firm simulates the\ndistribution of the future exposure to a\ncounterparty, then applies market-based\ndefault probabilities to the future exposure,\nleveraging external third-party CDS spread\ndata. Where CDS spread data are unavailable\nfor a specific counterparty, bond market\nspreads, CDS spread data based on the\ncounterparty\u2019s credit rating or CDS spread\ndata that reference a comparable counterparty\nmay be utilized. The Firm also considers\ncollateral held and legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements that mitigate its exposure\nto each counterparty. Adjustments for model\nuncertainty are taken for positions whose\nunderlying models are reliant on significant\ninputs that are neither directly nor\nindirectly observable, hence requiring\nreliance on established theoretical concepts\nin their derivation. These adjustments are\nderived by making assessments of the possible\ndegree of variability using statistical\napproaches and market-based information where\npossible. The Firm may apply concentration\nadjustments to certain of its OTC derivative\nportfolios to reflect the additional cost of\nclosing out a particularly large risk\nexposure. Where possible, these adjustments\nare based on observable market information,\nbut in many instances, significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the costs of closing out\nconcentrated risk exposures due to the lack of\nliquidity in the marketplace. The Firm applies\nan FVA in the fair value measurements of OTC\nuncollateralized or partially collateralized\nderivatives and in collateralized derivatives\nwhere the terms of the agreement do not permit\nthe reuse of the collateral received. In\ngeneral, FVA reflects a market funding risk\npremium inherent in the noted derivative\ninstruments. The methodology for measuring FVA\nleverages the Firm\u2019s existing credit-related\nvaluation adjustment calculation\nmethodologies, which apply to both assets and\nliabilities. See Note 5 for a description of\nvaluation techniques applied to the major\ncategories of financial instruments measured\nat fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured\nat Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Certain\nof the Firm\u2019s assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis. The Firm incurs losses or gains for any\nadjustments of these assets or liabilities to\nfair value. For assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis, fair value is determined by using\nvarious\n                                 \n  89    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for\ninputs as described above, which requires that\nobservable inputs be used when available, is\nused in measuring fair value for these items.\nFor further information on financial assets\nand liabilities that are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring and non-recurring basis,\nsee Note 5. Offsetting of Derivative\nInstruments In connection with its derivative\nactivities, the Firm generally enters into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with its counterparties. These\nagreements provide the Firm with the right, in\nthe event of a default by the counterparty, to\nnet a counterparty\u2019s rights and obligations\nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set\noff cash collateral against any net amount\nowed by the counterparty. Derivatives with\nenforceable master netting agreements are\nreported net of cash collateral received and\nposted. However, in certain circumstances, the\nFirm may not have such an agreement in place;\nthe relevant insolvency regime may not support\nthe enforceability of the master netting\nagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm\nmay not have sought legal advice to support\nthe enforceability of the agreement. In cases\nwhere the Firm has not determined an agreement\nto be enforceable, the related amounts are not\noffset (see Note 7). The Firm\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to receive cash and/or securities\nposted as collateral (with rights of\nrehypothecation), irrespective of the\nenforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In\ncertain cases, the Firm may agree for such\ncollateral to be posted to a third-party\ncustodian under a control agreement that\nenables it to take control of such collateral\nin the event of a counterparty default. The\nenforceability of the master netting agreement\nis taken into account in the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement practices and application of\ncounterparty credit limits. For information\nrelated to offsetting of derivatives, see Note\n7. Hedge Accounting The Firm applies hedge\naccounting using various derivative financial\ninstruments for the following types of hedges:\nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets\nand liabilities due to the risk being hedged\n(fair value hedges); and hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations whose\nfunctional currency is different from the\nreporting currency of the Parent Company (net\ninvestment hedges). These financial\ninstruments are included within Trading\nassets\u2014Derivative and other contracts or\nTrading liabilities\u2014Derivative and other\ncontracts in the balance sheets. For hedges\nwhere hedge accounting is being applied, the\nFirm performs effectiveness testing and other\nprocedures. Fair Value Hedges\u2014Interest Rate\nRisk The Firm\u2019s designated fair value hedges\nconsist of interest rate swaps designated as\nhedges of changes in the benchmark interest\nrate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and\nsenior borrowings. In the fourth quarter of\n2019, the Firm also began designating interest\nrate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in\nthe benchmark interest rate of certain fixed\nrate deposits. The Firm is permitted to hedge\nthe full, or part of the, contractual term of\nthe hedged instrument. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to perform an ongoing\nprospective and retrospective assessment of\nthe effectiveness of these hedging\nrelationships. A hedging relationship is\ndeemed effective if the change in fair value\nof the hedging instrument (derivative) and the\nchange in fair value of the hedged item (AFS\nsecurity, deposit liability or borrowing), due\nto changes in the benchmark interest rate,\noffset within a range of 80% to 125%. The Firm\nconsiders the impact of valuation adjustments\nrelated to counterparty credit spreads and its\nown credit spreads to determine whether they\nwould cause the hedging relationship to be\nineffective. For qualifying fair value hedges\nof benchmark interest rates, the change in the\nfair value of the derivative, offset by the\nchange in the fair value attributable to the\nchange in the benchmark interest rate risk of\nthe hedged asset (liability), is recognized in\nearnings each period as a component of\nInterest income (expense). For AFS securities,\nthe change in fair value of the hedged item\ndue to changes other than the risk being\nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI.\nWhen a derivative is de-designated as a hedge,\nany basis adjustment remaining on the hedged\nasset (liability) is amortized to Interest\nincome (expense) over the remaining life of\nthe asset (liability) using the effective\ninterest method. Net Investment Hedges The\nFirm uses forward foreign exchange contracts\nto manage a portion of the currency exposure\nrelating to its net investments in foreign\noperations. To the extent that the notional\namounts of the hedging instruments equal the\nportion of the investments being hedged and\nthe underlying exchange rate of the derivative\nhedging instrument is the same as the exchange\nrate between the functional currency of the\ninvestee and the intermediate parent entity\u2019s\nfunctional currency, it is considered to be\nperfectly effective, with no income statement\nrecognition. The gain or loss from revaluing\nhedges of net investments in foreign\noperations at the spot rate is reported within\nAOCI. The forward points on the hedging\ninstruments are excluded from hedge\neffectiveness testing and changes in the fair\nvalue of this excluded component are recorded\ncurrently in Interest income. For further\ninformation on derivative instruments and\nhedging activities, see Note 7. AFS Investment\nSecurities AFS securities are reported at fair\nvalue in the balance sheets. Interest income,\nincluding amortization of premiums and\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    90  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \naccretion of discounts, is included in\nInterest income in the Income statements.\nUnrealized gains are recorded in OCI and\nunrealized losses are recorded either in OCI\nor in Other revenues as described below.\n\nAFS securities in an unrealized loss position\nare first evaluated to determine whether there\nis an intent to sell or it is more likely than\nnot the Firm will be required to sell before\nrecovery of the amortized cost basis. If so,\nthe amortized cost basis is written down to\nthe fair value of the security such that the\nentire unrealized loss is recognized in Other\nrevenues and any previously established ACL is\nwritten off.\n\nFor all other AFS securities in an unrealized\nloss position, any portion of unrealized\nlosses representing a credit loss is\nrecognized in Other revenues and as an\nincrease to the ACL for AFS securities, with\nthe remainder of unrealized losses recognized\nin OCI. A credit loss exists if the Firm does\nnot expect to recover the amortized cost basis\nof the security. When considering whether a\ncredit loss exists, the Firm considers\nrelevant information, including:\n\n\u2022 guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the\nU.S. Government;\n\n\u2022 the extent to which the fair value has been\nless than the amortized cost basis;\n\n\u2022 adverse conditions specifically related to\nthe security, its industry or geographic area;\n\n\u2022 changes in the financial condition of the\nissuer of the security, or, in the case of an\nasset-backed debt security, changes in the\nfinancial condition of the underlying loan\nobligors;\n\n\u2022 the payment structure of the debt security\nand the likelihood of the issuer being able to\nmake payments that increase in the future;\n\n\u2022 failure of the issuer of the security to\nmake scheduled interest or principal payments;\n\n\u2022 the current rating and any changes to the\nrating of the security by a rating agency.\n\nIf a credit loss exists, the Firm measures the\ncredit loss as the difference between the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected (discounted at the implicit interest\nrate at acquisition of the security or\ndiscounted at the effective yield for\nsecurities that incorporate changes in\nprepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost\nbasis of the security. Changes in prepayment\nassumptions alone are not considered to result\nin a credit loss. When estimating the present\nvalue of expected cash flows, information\nutilized includes the remaining payment terms\nof the security, prepayment speeds, financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and\nthe value of any underlying collateral.\n\nPresentation of ACL and Provision for Credit\nLosses\n                                              \n                                Provision     \n                 ACL            for           \n                                Credit        \n                                Losses        \n  AFS            Contra         Other         \n  securities     Investment     revenue       \n                 securities                   \n                                              \nNonaccrual & ACL\nCharge-offs on AFS\nSecurities AFS\nsecurities follow the\nsame nonaccrual and\nwrite-off guidance as\ndiscussed in\n\u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein, except\nas set forth in\n\u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein.

Loans The\nFirm accounts for\nloans based on the\nfollowing categories:\nloans held for\ninvestment; loans held\nfor sale; and loans at\nfair value. Nonaccrual\nAll loan categories\ndescribed below follow\nthe same nonaccrual\nand write-off guidance\nas discussed in\n\u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein. Loans\nHeld for Investment\nLoans held for\ninvestment are\nreported at\noutstanding principal\nadjusted for any\ncharge-offs, the\nallowance for loan\nlosses, any\nunamortized deferred\nfees or costs for\noriginated loans, and\nany unamortized\npremiums or discounts\nfor purchased loans.\nInterest Income.\nInterest income on\nperforming loans held\nfor investment is\naccrued and recognized\nas interest income at\nthe contractual rate\nof interest. Purchase\nprice discounts or\npremiums, as well as\nnet deferred loan fees\nor costs, are\namortized into\ninterest income over\nthe life of the loan\nto produce a level\nrate of return.\nLending Commitments.\nThe Firm records the\nliability and related\nexpense for the credit\nexposure related to\ncommitments to fund\nloans. For more\ninformation regarding\nloan commitments,\nstandby letters of\ncredit and financial\nguarantees, see Note\n15. For more\ninformation regarding\nallowance for credit\nlosses, refer to\n\u201cAllowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d herein. Loans\nHeld for Sale Loans\nheld for sale are\nmeasured at the lower\nof cost or fair value,\nwith valuation changes\nrecorded in Other\nrevenues. The Firm\ndetermines the\nvaluation allowance on\nan individual loan\nbasis, except for\nresidential mortgage\nloans for which the\nvaluation allowance is\ndetermined at the loan\nproduct level. Any\ndecreases in fair\nvalue below the\ninitial carrying\namount\n                                 \n  91    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nand any recoveries in fair value up to the\ninitial carrying amount are recorded in Other\nrevenues. Increases in fair value above\ninitial carrying value are not recognized.\nInterest income. Interest income on loans held\nfor sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums are deferred as an\nadjustment to the loan\u2019s cost basis until the\nrelated loan is sold and, as such, are\nincluded in the periodic determination of the\nlower of cost or fair value adjustments and\nthe gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Lending Commitments. Commitments to fund\nmortgage loans held for sale are derivatives\nand are reported in Trading assets or Trading\nliabilities in the balance sheets with an\noffset to Trading revenues in the income\nstatements. For commitments to fund non-\nmortgage loans, the Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the fair value\nexposure below cost of such commitments in\nOther liabilities and accrued expenses in the\nbalance sheets with an offset to Other\nrevenues in the income statements. Because\nloans and lending commitments held for sale\nare recognized at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, the allowance for loan losses and\ncharge-off policies do not apply to these\nloans. Loans at Fair Value Loans for which the\nfair value option is elected are carried at\nfair value, with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings. Loans carried at fair\nvalue are not evaluated for purposes of\nrecording an allowance for loan losses. For\nfurther information on loans carried at fair\nvalue and classified as Trading assets and\nTrading liabilities, see Note 5. Lending\nCommitments. The Firm records the liability\nand related expense for the fair value\nexposure related to commitments to fund loans\nthat will be measured at fair value. The\nliability is recorded in Trading liabilities\nin the balance sheets, and the expense is\nrecorded in Trading revenues in the income\nstatements. Because such loans and lending\ncommitments are reported at fair value, the\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. For\nfurther information on loans, see Note 10.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The ACL for financ\nial instruments measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet exposures ( e.g.,\nHFI loans and lending commitments, HTM\nsecurities, customer and other receivables and\ncertain guarantees) represents an estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the entire life of\nthe financial instrument. Factors considered\nby management when determining the ACL include\npayment status, fair value of collateral and\nexpected payments of principal and interest,\nas well as internal or external information\nrelating to past events, current conditions\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts. The\nFirm uses three forecasts that include\nassumptions about certain macroeconomic\nvariables including, but not limited to, U.S.\ngross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d), equity market\nindices and unemployment rates, as well as\ncommercial real estate and home price indices.\nAt the conclusion of the Firm\u2019s reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of 13 quarters,\nthere is a gradual reversion back to\nhistorical averages. The ACL is measured on a\ncollective basis when similar risk\ncharacteristics exist for multiple instruments\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing the collectability of cash flows.\nGenerally, the Firm applies a probability of\ndefault/loss given default model for\ninstruments that are collectively assessed,\nunder which the ACL is calculated as the\nproduct of probability of default, loss given\ndefault and exposure at default. These\nparameters are forecast for each collective\ngroup of assets using a scenario-based\nstatistical model. If the instrument does not\nshare similar risk characteristics with other\ninstruments, including when it is probable\nthat the Firm will be unable to collect the\nfull payment of principal and interest on the\ninstrument when due, the ACL is measured on an\nindividual basis. The Firm generally applies a\ndiscounted cash flow method for instruments\nthat are individually assessed. The Firm may\nalso elect to use an approach that considers\nthe fair value of the collateral when\nmeasuring the ACL if the loan is collateral\ndependent ( i.e., repayment of the loan is\nexpected to be provided substantially by the\nsale or operation of the underlying collateral\nand the borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty). Additionally, the Firm can elect\nto use an approach to measure the ACL using\nthe fair value of collateral where the\nborrower is required to, and reasonably\nexpected to, continually adjust and replenish\nthe amount of collateral securing the\ninstrument to reflect changes in the fair\nvalue of such collateral. The Firm has elected\nto use this approach for certain securities-\nbased loans, margin loans, Securities\npurchased under agreements to resell and\nSecurities borrowed. Credit quality indicators\nconsidered in developing the ACL include: \u2022\nCorporate loans, Secured lending facilities,\nCommercial real estate loans and securities,\nand Other loans: Internal risk ratings\ndeveloped by the Credit Risk Management\nDepartment that are refreshed at least\nannually, and more frequently as necessary.\nThese ratings generally correspond to external\nratings published by S&P.

Such modifications are\naccounted for and reported as a TDR, except\nfor certain modifications related to the\nCoronavirus Disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as noted in\n\u201cModifications and Nonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by COVID-19\u201d herein. A loan\nthat has been modified in a TDR is generally\nconsidered to be impaired and is evaluated\nindividually. TDRs are also generally\nclassified as nonaccrual and may be returned\nto accrual status only after the Firm expects\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest and there is sustained\nrepayment performance for a reasonable period.\n\nNonaccrual\n\nThe Firm places financial instruments on\nnonaccrual status if principal or interest is\nnot expected when contractually due or is past\ndue for a period of 90 days or more unless the\nobligation is well-\nsecured and in the\nprocess of collection.\nFor borrowers impacted\nby COVID-19, see\n\u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein for\nadditional\nconsiderations. For\nany instrument placed\non nonaccrual status,\nthe Firm reverses any\nunpaid interest\naccrued with an\noffsetting reduction\nto Interest income.\nPrincipal and interest\npayments received on\nnonaccrual instruments\nare applied to\nprincipal if there is\ndoubt regarding the\nultimate\ncollectability of\nprincipal. If\ncollection of the\nprincipal is not in\ndoubt, interest income\nis realized on a cash\nbasis. If the\ninstrument is brought\ncurrent and neither\nprincipal or interest\ncollection is in\ndoubt, instruments can\ngenerally return to\naccrual status and\ninterest income can be\nrecognized.\nModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19 In the first\nquarter of 2020, the\nFirm elected to apply\nthe guidance issued by\nCongress in the\nCoronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (\u201cCARES\nAct\u201d) as well as by\nthe U.S. banking\nagencies stating that\ncertain concessions\ngranted to borrowers\nthat are current on\nexisting loans, either\nindividually or as\npart of a program for\ncreditworthy borrowers\nwho are experiencing\nshort-term financial\nor operational\nproblems as a result\nof COVID-19, generally\nwould not be\nconsidered TDRs.\nAdditionally, these\nloans generally would\nnot be considered\nnonaccrual unless\ncollectability\nconcerns exist despite\nthe modification\nprovided. For loans\nremaining on accrual\nstatus, the Firm\nelected to continue\nrecognizing interest\nincome during the\nmodification periods.\nACL Charge-offs The\nprincipal balance of a\nfinancial instrument\nis charged off in the\nperiod it is deemed\nuncollectible\nresulting in a\nreduction in the ACL\nand the balance of the\nfinancial instrument\nin the balance sheet.\nAccrued interest\nreceivable balances\nthat are separately\nrecorded from the\nrelated financial\ninstruments are\ncharged off against\nInterest income when\nthe related financial\ninstrument is placed\non nonaccrual.\nAccordingly, the Firm\nelected not to measure\nan ACL for accrued\ninterest receivables.\nHowever, in the case\nof loans that are\nmodified as a result\nof COVID-19 and remain\non accrual status due\nto the relief noted in\n\u201cModifications and\nNonaccrual Status for\nBorrowers Impacted by\nCOVID-19\u201d herein,\naccrued interest\nreceivable balances\nare assessed for any\nrequired ACL.\nTransfers of Financial\nAssets Transfers of\nfinancial assets are\naccounted for as sales\nwhen the Firm has\nrelinquished control\nover the transferred\nassets. Any related\ngain or loss on sale\nis recorded in Net\nrevenues. Transfers\nthat are not accounted\nfor as sales are\ntreated as\ncollateralized\nfinancings.

Securities\nborrowed and\nsecurities loaned are\nrecorded at the amount\nof cash collateral\nadvanced or received.\nIn instances where the\nFirm is the lender in\nsecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions and is\npermitted to sell or\nrepledge these\nsecurities, the fair\nvalue of the\ncollateral received is\nreported in Trading\nassets, and the\nrelated obligation to\nreturn the collateral\nis reported in Trading\nliabilities in the\nbalance sheets.\nSecurities-for-\nsecurities\ntransactions where the\nFirm is the borrower\nare not included in\nthe balance sheets. In\norder to manage credit\nexposure arising from\nthese transactions, in\nappropriate\ncircumstances, the\nFirm enters into\nmaster netting\nagreements and\ncollateral agreements\nwith its\ncounterparties. These\nagreements provide the\nFirm with the right,\nin the event of a\ndefault by the\ncounterparty, to net a\ncounterparty\u2019s rights\nand obligations under\nthe agreement and to\nliquidate and set off\ncollateral held by the\nFirm against the net\namount owed by the\ncounterparty. The\nFirm\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to take\npossession of\nsecurities purchased\nor borrowed in\nconnection with\nreverse repurchase\nagreements and\nsecurities borrowed\ntransactions,\nrespectively, and to\nreceive cash and/or\nsecurities delivered\nunder repurchase\nagreements or\nsecurities loaned\ntransactions (with\nrights of\nrehypothecation).

For\nboth the annual and\ninterim tests, the\nFirm has the option to\neither (i) perform a\nquantitative\nimpairment test or\n(ii) first perform a\nqualitative assessment\nto determine whether\nit is more likely than\nnot that the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, in\nwhich case the\nquantitative test\nwould be performed.\nWhen performing a\nquantitative\nimpairment test, the\nFirm compares the fair\nvalue of a reporting\nunit with its carrying\namount, including\ngoodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting\nunit is less than its\ncarrying amount, the\ngoodwill impairment\nloss is equal to the\nexcess of the carrying\nvalue over the fair\nvalue, limited to the\ncarrying amount of\ngoodwill allocated to\nthat reporting unit.\nThe estimated fair\nvalues of the\nreporting units are\nderived based on\nvaluation techniques\nthe Firm believes\nmarket participants\nwould use for each\nrespective reporting\nunit. The estimated\nfair values are\ngenerally determined\nby utilizing a\ndiscounted cash flow\nmethodology or\nmethodologies that\nincorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-\nearnings multiples of\ncertain comparable\ncompanies. Intangible\nassets are amortized\nover their estimated\nuseful lives and are\nreviewed for\nimpairment on an\ninterim basis when\nimpairment indicators\nare present.\nImpairment losses are\nrecorded within Other\nexpenses in the income\nstatements. Earnings\nper Common Share Basic\nEPS is computed by\ndividing earnings\navailable to Morgan\nStanley common\nshareholders by the\nweighted average\nnumber of common\nshares outstanding for\nthe period. Earnings\navailable to Morgan\nStanley common\nshareholders\nrepresents net income\napplicable to Morgan\nStanley reduced by\npreferred stock\ndividends. Common\nshares outstanding\ninclude common stock\nand vested RSUs where\nrecipients\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    94  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nhave satisfied the relevant vesting terms.\nDiluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of\nall dilutive securities. Share-based awards\nthat pay dividend equivalents subject to\nvesting are included in diluted shares\noutstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury\nstock method. The Firm has granted PSUs that\nvest and convert to shares of common stock\nonly if predetermined performance and market\ngoals are satisfied. Since the issuance of the\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the PSUs are included in\ndiluted EPS based on the number of shares (if\nany) that would be issuable if the reporting\ndate was the end of the performance period.\nFor further information on diluted earnings\n(loss) per common share, see Note 18 to the\nfinancial statements. Deferred Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation The Firm measures\ncompensation expense for stock-based awards at\nfair value. The Firm determines the fair value\nof RSUs (including PSUs with non-market\nperformance conditions) based on the grant-\ndate fair value of its common stock, measured\nas the volume-weighted average price on the\ndate of grant (\u201cVWAP\u201d). The fair value of RSUs\nnot entitled to dividends until conversion is\nmeasured at VWAP reduced by the present value\nof dividends expected to be paid on the\nunderlying shares prior to scheduled\nconversion date. PSUs that contain market-\nbased conditions are valued using a Monte\nCarlo valuation model. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nCompensation expense for awards with\nperformance conditions is recognized based on\nthe probable outcome of the performance\ncondition at each reporting date. Compensation\nexpense for awards with market-based\nconditions is recognized irrespective of the\nprobability of the market condition being\nachieved and is not reversed if the market\ncondition is not met. The Firm accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards\ngenerally contain clawback and cancellation\nprovisions. Certain awards provide the Firm\ndiscretion to claw back or cancel all or a\nportion of the award under specified\ncircumstances. Compensation expense for those\nawards is adjusted for changes in the fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s common stock or the\nrelevant model valuation, as appropriate,\nuntil conversion, exercise or expiration.\nEmployee Stock Trusts In connection with\ncertain stock-based compensation plans, the\nFirm has established employee stock trusts to\nprovide, at its discretion, common stock\nvoting rights to certain RSU holders.\nFollowing an RSU award, when a stock trust is\nutilized, the Firm contributes shares to be\nheld in the stock trust until the RSUs convert\nto common shares. The assets of the employee\nstock trusts are consolidated with those of\nthe Firm and are generally accounted for in a\nmanner similar to treasury stock, where the\nshares of common stock outstanding reported in\nCommon stock issued to employee stock trusts\nare offset by an equal amount reported in\nEmployee stock trusts in the balance sheets.\nThe Firm uses the grant-date fair value of\nstock-based compensation as the basis for\nrecording the movement of the assets to or\nfrom the employee stock trusts. Changes in the\nfair value are not recognized as the Firm\u2019s\nstock-based compensation must be settled by\ndelivery of a fixed number of shares of the\nFirm\u2019s common stock. Deferred Cash-Based\nCompensation Compensation expense for deferred\ncash-based compensation awards is calculated\nbased on the notional value of the award\ngranted, adjusted for changes in the fair\nvalue of the referenced investments that\nemployees select. Compensation expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period relevant to\neach separately vesting portion of the award.\nCompensation expense for these awards is\nadjusted based on notional earnings of the\nreferenced investments until distribution. The\nFirm invests directly, as a principal, in\nfinancial instruments and other investments to\neconomically hedge certain of its obligations\nunder its deferred cash-based compensation\nplans. Changes in the value of such\ninvestments are recorded in Trading revenues\nand Investments revenues. Although changes in\ncompensation expense resulting from changes in\nthe fair value of the referenced investments\nwill generally be offset by changes in the\nfair value of investments made by the Firm,\nthere is typically a timing difference between\nthe immediate recognition of gains and losses\non the Firm\u2019s investments and the deferred\nrecognition of the related compensation\nexpense over the vesting period. Retirement-\nEligible Employee Compensation For year-end\nstock-based awards and deferred cash-based\ncompensation awards anticipated to be granted\nto retirement-eligible employees under award\nterms that do not contain a future service\nrequirement, the Firm accrues the estimated\ncost of the awards over the course of the\ncalendar year preceding the grant date, which\nreflects the period over which the\ncompensation is earned. Carried Interest\nCompensation The Firm generally recognizes\ncompensation expense for any portion of\ncarried interest (both realized and\nunrealized) that is allocated to employees.\nFor information on performance-based fees in\nthe form of carried interest, which are\ndirectly related to carried interest\ncompensation, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u2014Carried\nInterest\u201d herein.\n                                 \n  95    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nIncome Taxes Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are recorded based upon the\ntemporary differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax bases of assets and\nliabilities using currently enacted tax rates\nin effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The\neffect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in\nincome tax expense (benefit) in the period\nthat includes the enactment date. Such effects\nare recorded in income tax expense (benefit)\nfrom continuing operations regardless of where\ndeferred taxes were originally recorded. The\nFirm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the\nextent that it believes these assets are more\nlikely than not to be realized. In making such\na determination, the Firm considers all\navailable positive and negative evidence,\nincluding future reversals of existing taxable\ntemporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax planning strategies and\nresults of recent operations. When performing\nthe assessment, the Firm considers all types\nof deferred tax assets in combination with\neach other, regardless of the origin of the\nunderlying temporary difference. If a deferred\ntax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. If the\nFirm subsequently determines that it would be\nable to realize deferred tax assets in excess\nof their net recorded amount, it would make an\nadjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation\nallowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes. The Firm recognizes tax\nexpense associated with Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income as it is incurred as part of the\ncurrent income taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period. Uncertain tax\npositions are recorded on the basis of a two-\nstep process, whereby (i) the Firm determines\nwhether it is more likely than not that the\ntax positions will be sustained on the basis\nof the technical merits of the position and\n(ii) for those tax positions that meet this\nthreshold, the Firm recognizes the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon ultimate settlement\nwith the related tax authority. Interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\nare recognized as a component of the provision\nfor income taxes. Foreign Currencies Assets\nand liabilities of operations with non-U.S.\ndollar functional currencies are translated at\nyear-end rates of exchange. Gains or losses\nresulting from translating foreign currency\nfinancial statements, net of hedge gains or\nlosses and related tax effects, are reflected\nin AOCI in the balance sheets. Gains or losses\nresulting from remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in net\nincome, and amounts recognized in the income\nstatement are translated at the rate of\nexchange on the respective date of recognition\nfor each amount. Accounting Updates Adopted in\n2020 Reference Rate Reform The Firm has\nadopted the Reference Rate Reform accounting\nupdate. There was no impact to the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements upon initial adoption.\nThis accounting update provides optional\naccounting relief to entities with contracts,\nhedge accounting relationships or other\ntransactions that reference LIBOR or other\ninterest rate benchmarks for which the\nreferenced rate is expected to be discontinued\nor replaced. The Firm is applying the\naccounting relief as relevant contract and\nhedge accounting relationship modifications\nare made during the course of the reference\nrate reform transition period. The optional\nrelief generally allows for contract\nmodifications solely related to the\nreplacement of the reference rate to be\naccounted for as a continuation of the\nexisting contract instead of as an\nextinguishment of the contract and would\ntherefore not trigger certain accounting\nimpacts that would otherwise be required. It\nalso allows entities to change certain\ncritical terms of existing hedge accounting\nrelationships that are affected by reference\nrate reform, and these changes would not\nrequire de-designating the hedge accounting\nrelationship. The optional relief ends\nDecember 31, 2022. Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses The Firm has adopted\nthe Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses. This\naccounting update impacted the impairment\nmodel for certain financial assets measured at\namortized cost by requiring a CECL methodology\nto estimate expected credit losses over the\nentire life of the financial asset, recorded\nat inception or purchase. CECL replaced the\nincurred loss model previously applicable to\nloans held for investment, HTM securities and\nother receivables carried at amortized cost,\nsuch as employee loans. The update also\neliminated the concept of other-than-temporary\nimpairment for AFS securities and instead\nrequires impairments on AFS securities to be\nrecognized in earnings through an allowance\nwhen the fair value is less than amortized\ncost and a credit loss exists, and through a\npermanent reduction of the amortized cost\nbasis when the securities are expected to be\nsold before recovery of amortized cost. At\ntransition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of\nthis accounting standard resulted in an\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses of\n$ 131million with a corresponding reduction in\nRetained earnings of $ 100million, net of tax.\nThe adoption impact was primarily attributable\nto a $ 124million increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses on employee loans.\n                                 \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    96  \n                                 \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2019 Leases Upon\nthe adoption of Leases, the Firm began\nrecognizing in the balance sheet leases with\nterms exceeding one year as right-of-use\n(\u201cROU\u201d) assets and corresponding liabilities.\nThe adoption resulted in an increase to\nRetained earnings of approximately $\n63million, net of tax, related to deferred\nrevenue from previously recorded sale-\nleaseback transactions. At transition on\nJanuary 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in\na balance sheet gross-up of approximately $\n4billion reflected in Other assets and Other\nliabilities and accrued expenses. See Note 10\nfor lease disclosures, including amounts\nreflected in the December 31, 2019 balance\nsheet. Prior period amounts were not restated.\nAs allowed by the guidance, the Firm elected\nnot to reassess the following at transition:\nwhether existing contracts are or contain\nleases; and for existing leases, lease\nclassification and initial direct costs. In\naddition, the Firm continues to account for\nexisting land easements as service contracts.\nBoth at transition and for new leases\nthereafter, ROU assets and lease liabilities\nare initially recognized based on the present\nvalue of the future minimum lease payments\nover the lease term, including non-lease\ncomponents such as fixed common area\nmaintenance costs and other fixed costs such\nas real estate taxes and insurance. The\ndiscount rates used in determining the present\nvalue of leases are the Firm\u2019s incremental\nborrowing rates, developed based upon each\nlease\u2019s term and currency of payment. The\nlease term includes options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that the Firm will exercise that\noption. For operating leases, the ROU assets\nalso include any prepaid lease payments and\ninitial direct costs incurred and are reduced\nby lease incentives. For these leases, lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term if the ROU asset has not\nbeen impaired or abandoned. Derivatives and\nHedging (ASU 2018-16) The amendments in this\nupdate permit use of the OIS rate based on the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S.\nbenchmark interest rate for hedge accounting\npurposes. The Firm adopted this update on a\nprospective basis for qualifying new or\nredesignated hedging relationships. This\nupdate did not impact the Firm\u2019s pre-existing\nhedges. 3. Acquisitions Acquisition of E*TRADE\nOn October 2, 2020, the Firm completed the\nacquisition of 100% of E*TRADE Financial\nCorporation (\u201cE*TRADE\u201d) in a stock-for-stock\ntransaction, which increases the scale and\nbreadth of the Wealth Management business\nsegment. Total consideration for the\ntransaction was approximately $ 11.9\nbillion, which\nprincipally consists\nof the $ 11billion\nfair value of\n233million common\nshares issued from\nCommon stock held in\ntreasury, at an\nexchange ratio of\n1.0432per E*TRADE\ncommon share. In\naddition, the Firm\nissued Series M and\nSeries N preferred\nshares with a fair\nvalue of approximately\n$ 0.7billion in\nexchange for E*TRADE\u2019s\nexisting preferred\nstock.\n\nUpon acquisition, the\nassets and liabilities\nof E*TRADE were\nadjusted to their\nrespective fair values\nas of the closing date\nof the transaction,\nincluding the\nidentifiable\nintangible assets\nacquired. In addition,\nthe excess of the\npurchase price over\nthe fair value of the\nnet assets acquired\nhas been recorded as\ngoodwill.

The valuation\nof loans and lending commitments also takes\ninto account fee income that is considered an\nattribute of the contract. \u2022 Fair value of\nmortgage loans is determined using observable\nprices based on transactional data or third-\nparty pricing for comparable instruments, when\navailable. \u2022 Where position-specific external\nprices are not observable, fair value is\nestimated based on benchmarking to prices and\nrates observed in the primary market for\nsimilar loan or borrower types or based on the\npresent value of\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    100  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nexpected future cash flows using the Firm\u2019s\nbest available estimates of the key\nassumptions, including forecasted credit\nlosses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves\nand discount rates commensurate with the risks\ninvolved or a methodology that utilizes the\ncapital structure and credit spreads of recent\ncomparable securitization transactions. \u2022 Fair\nvalue of equity margin loans is determined by\ndiscounting future interest cash flows, net of\npotential losses resulting from large downward\nprice movements of the underlying margin loan\ncollateral. The potential losses are modeled\nusing the margin loan rate, which is\ncalibrated from market observable CDS spreads,\nimplied debt yields or volatility metrics of\nthe loan collateral.

If the spread data do not reference\nthe issuer, then data that reference\ncomparable issuers are used. When position-\nspecific external price data are not\nobservable, fair value is determined based on\neither benchmarking to comparable instruments\nor cash flow models with yield curves, bond or\nsingle-name CDS spreads and recovery rates as\nsignificant inputs.

Other model inputs such as credit\nspreads, including collateral spreads, and\ninterest rates, are typically observable. \u2022\nAsset-backed CDOs are valued based on an\nevaluation of the market and model input\nparameters sourced from comparable instruments\nas indicated by market activity.

Many pricing models do\nnot entail material subjectivity as the\nmethodologies employed do not necessitate\nsignificant judgment since model inputs may be\nobserved from actively quoted markets, as is\nthe case for generic interest rate swaps, many\nequity, commodity and foreign currency option\ncontracts, and certain CDS. In the case of\nmore established derivative products, the\npricing models used by the Firm are widely\naccepted by the financial services industry. \u2022\nMore complex OTC derivative products are\ntypically less liquid and require more\njudgment in the implementation of the\nvaluation technique since direct trading\nactivity or quotes are unobservable. This\nincludes certain types of interest rate\nderivatives with both volatility and\ncorrelation exposure, equity, commodity or\nforeign currency derivatives that are either\nlonger-dated or include exposure to multiple\nunderlyings, and credit derivatives, including\nCDS on certain mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities and basket CDS. Where required\ninputs are unobservable, relationships to\nobservable data points, based on historical\nand/or implied observations, may be employed\nas a technique to estimate the model input\nvalues.

These investments are included in the\nFund Interests table in the \"Net Asset Value\nMeasurements\" section herein. \u2022 For non-\nexchange-traded investments either held\ndirectly or held within internally managed\nfunds, fair value after initial recognition is\nbased on an assessment of each underlying\ninvestment, considering rounds of financing\nand third-party transactions, discounted cash\nflow analyses and market-based information,\nincluding comparable Firm transactions,\ntrading multiples and changes in market\noutlook, among other factors.

Net transfers in 2020 reflect the largely\noffsetting impacts of transfers in of $\n857million of equity margin loans in the first\nquarter of 2020 and transfers out of $\n707million of equity margin loans in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. The loans were\ntransferred into Level 3 in the first quarter\nas the significance of the margin loan rate\ninput increased as a result of reduced\nliquidity, and transferred out of Level 3 in\nthe second quarter as liquidity conditions\nimproved, reducing the significance of the\ninput.\n\n2. Purchases of AFS investment securities in\n2020 relate to securities acquired as part of\nthe E*TRADE transaction. For additional\ninformation on the acquisition of E*TRADE, see\nNote 3.\n\n3. During 2018, the Firm transferred from\nLevel 3 to Level 2 $ 2.4billion of Equity\nDerivatives due to a reduction in the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs\nrelating to volatility.\nLevel 3 instruments\nmay be hedged with\ninstruments classified\nin Level 1 and Level\n2.

The\nunrealized gains\n(losses) during the\nperiod for assets and\nliabilities within the\nLevel 3 category may\ninclude changes in\nfair value during the\nperiod that were\nattributable to

Amounts represent weighted averages\nexcept where simple averages and the median of\nthe inputs are more relevant.\n\n2. Includes derivative contracts with multiple\nrisks ( i.e. , hybrid products).\nThe previous tables\nprovide information on\nthe valuation\ntechniques,\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs,\nand the ranges and\naverages for each\nmajor category of\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value\non a recurring and\nnonrecurring basis\nwith a significant\nLevel 3 balance. The\nlevel of aggregation\nand breadth of\nproducts cause the\nrange of inputs to be\nwide\n\nand not evenly\ndistributed across the\ninventory of financial\ninstruments. Further,\nthe range of\nunobservable inputs\nmay differ across\nfirms in the financial\nservices industry\nbecause of diversity\nin the types of\nproducts included in\neach firm\u2019s inventory.\nGenerally, there are\nno predictable\nrelationships between\nmultiple significant\nunobservable inputs\nattributable to a\ngiven valuation\ntechnique. Other than\nas follows, during\n2020, there were no\nsignificant revisions\nmade to the\ndescriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s significant\nunobservable inputs.\nFor margin loans, the\nmargin loan rate is\nthe annualized rate\nthat reflects the\npossibility of losses\nas a result of\nmovements in the price\nof the underlying\nmargin loan\ncollateral. The rate\nis calibrated from the\npreviously disclosed\ndiscount rate, credit\nspread and/or\nvolatility measures.\nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a higher (lower)\nfair value. \u2022\nComparable bond or\nloan price: A pricing\ninput used when prices\nfor the identical\ninstrument are not\navailable. Significant\nsubjectivity may be\ninvolved when fair\nvalue is determined\nusing pricing data\navailable for\ncomparable\ninstruments. Valuation\nusing comparable\ninstruments can be\ndone by calculating an\nimplied yield (or\nspread over a liquid\nbenchmark) from the\nprice of a comparable\nbond or loan, then\nadjusting that yield\n(or spread) to derive\na value for the bond\nor loan. The\nadjustment to yield\n(or spread) should\naccount for relevant\ndifferences in the\nbonds or loans such as\nmaturity or credit\nquality.\nAlternatively, a\nprice-to-price basis\ncan be assumed between\nthe comparable\ninstrument and the\nbond or loan being\nvalued in order to\nestablish the value of\nthe bond or loan. \u2022\nComparable equity\nprice: A price derived\nfrom equity raises,\nshare buybacks and\nexternal bid levels,\netc. A discount or\npremium may be\nincluded in the fair\nvalue estimate. \u2022\nContingency\nprobability:\nProbability associated\nwith the realization\nof an underlying event\nupon which the value\nof an asset is\ncontingent. \u2022 EBITDA\nmultiple / Exit\nmultiple: The ratio of\nEnterprise Value to\nEBITDA, where\nEnterprise Value is\nthe aggregate value of\nequity and debt minus\ncash and cash\nequivalents. The\nEBITDA multiple\nreflects the value of\nthe company in terms\nof its full-year\nEBITDA, whereas the\nexit multiple reflects\nthe value of the\ncompany in terms of\nits full-year expected\nEBITDA at exit. Either\nmultiple allows\ncomparison between\ncompanies from an\noperational\nperspective as the\neffect of capital\nstructure, taxation\nand depreciation/amort\nization is excluded. \u2022\nRecovery rate: Amount\nexpressed as a\npercentage of par that\nis expected to be\nreceived when a credit\nevent occurs.\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    106  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nAn increase (decrease)\nto the following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin a lower (higher)\nfair value. \u2022 Cash-\nsynthetic basis: The\nmeasure of the price\ndifferential between\ncash financial\ninstruments and their\nsynthetic derivative-\nbased equivalents. The\nrange disclosed in the\nprevious table\nsignifies the number\nof points by which the\nsynthetic bond\nequivalent price is\nhigher than the quoted\nprice of the\nunderlying cash bonds.\n\u2022 Funding spread: The\ncost of borrowing\ndefined as the\nincremental spread\nover the OIS rate for\na specific collateral\nrate (which refers to\nthe rate applicable to\na specific type of\nsecurity pledged as\ncollateral). \u2022 Margin\nloan rate: The\nannualized rate that\nreflects the\npossibility of losses\nas a result of\nmovements in the price\nof the underlying\nmargin loan\ncollateral. The rate\nis calibrated from the\ndiscount rate, credit\nspreads and/or\nvolatility measures. \u2022\nWACC: WACC represents\nthe theoretical rate\nof return required to\ndebt and equity\ninvestors. The WACC is\nused in a discounted\ncash flow model that\ncalculates the value\nof the equity. The\nmodel assumes that the\ncash flow assumptions,\nincluding projections,\nare fully reflected in\nthe current equity\nvalue, while the debt\nto equity ratio is\nheld constant. An\nincrease (decrease) to\nthe following\nsignificant\nunobservable inputs\nwould generally result\nin an impact to the\nfair value, but the\nmagnitude and\ndirection of the\nimpact would depend on\nwhether the Firm is\nlong or short the\nexposure. \u2022\nCorrelation: A pricing\ninput where the payoff\nis driven by more than\none underlying risk.\nCorrelation is a\nmeasure of the\nrelationship between\nthe movement of two\nvariables ( i.e. , how\nthe change in one\nvariable influences a\nchange in the other\nvariable). \u2022 Credit\nspread: The credit\nspread reflects the\nadditional net yield\nan investor can earn\nfrom a security with\nmore credit risk\nrelative to one with\nless credit risk. The\ncredit spread of a\nparticular security is\noften quoted in\nrelation to the yield\non a credit risk-free\nbenchmark security or\nreference rate,\ntypically either U.S.\nTreasury or LIBOR. \u2022\nInterest rate curve:\nThe term structure of\ninterest rates\n(relationship between\ninterest rates and the\ntime to maturity) and\na market\u2019s measure of\nfuture interest rates\nat the time of\nobservation. An\ninterest rate curve is\nused to set interest\nrate and foreign\nexchange derivative\ncash flows and is a\npricing input used in\nthe discounting of any\nOTC derivative cash\nflow. \u2022 Volatility:\nThe measure of\nvariability in\npossible returns for\nan instrument given\nhow much that\ninstrument changes in\nvalue over time.\nVolatility is a\npricing input for\noptions\n\nand, generally, the\nlower the volatility,\nthe less risky the\noption. The level of\nvolatility used in the\nvaluation of a\nparticular option\ndepends on a number of\nfactors, including the\nnature of the risk\nunderlying that\noption, the tenor and\nthe strike price of\nthe option. \u2022\nVolatility skew: The\nmeasure of the\ndifference in implied\nvolatility for options\nwith identical\nunderliers and expiry\ndates but with\ndifferent strikes.

For other items, gains and\nlosses are recorded in Other revenues if the\nitem is held for sale; otherwise, they are\nrecorded in Other expenses.\n\n2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of\nloans and lending commitments were calculated\nas follows: for the held-for-investment\ncategory, based on the value of the underlying\ncollateral; and for the held-for-sale\ncategory, based on recently executed\ntransactions, market price quotations,\nvaluation models that incorporate market\nobservable inputs where possible, such as\ncomparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread\nlevels adjusted for any basis difference\nbetween cash and derivative instruments, or\ndefault recovery analysis where such\ntransactions and quotations are unobservable.\n\n3.

The Firm,\nin turn, performs\nunder a CDS if a\ncredit event as\ndefined under the\ncontract occurs.\nTypical credit events\ninclude bankruptcy,\ndissolution or\ninsolvency of the\nreferenced entity,\nfailure to pay and\nrestructuring of the\nobligations of the\nreferenced entity.\nIndex and Basket CDS.\nIndex and basket CDS\nare products where\ncredit protection is\nprovided on a\nportfolio of single-\nname CDS. Generally,\nin the event of a\ndefault on one of the\nunderlying names, the\nFirm pays a pro rata\nportion of the total\nnotional amount of the\nCDS. The Firm also\nenters into tranched\nindex and basket CDS\nwhere credit\nprotection is provided\non a particular\nportion of the\nportfolio loss\ndistribution.

Additionally,\nthe Firm does not\nintend to sell the\nsecurities and is not\nlikely to be required\nto sell the securities\nprior to recovery of\nthe amortized cost\nbasis. Furthermore,\nthe securities have\nnot experienced credit\nlosses as they are\npredominantly\ninvestment grade and\nthe Firm expects to\nrecover the amortized\ncost basis. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nHTM securities net\ncarrying amount\nreflects an ACL of $\n26million related to\nNon-agency CMBS. See\nNote 2 for a\ndescription of the ACL\nmethodology used\nbeginning in 2020\nfollowing the Firm\u2019s\nadoption of CECL and\nprior period credit\nloss considerations.\nThere were noHTM\nsecurities in an\nunrealized loss\nposition as of\nDecember 31, 2019 that\nwere other-than-\ntemporarily\n\nimpaired. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nNon-Agency CMBS HTM\nsecurities were\npredominantly on\naccrual status and\ninvestment grade.

Margin loans\nare extended on a demand basis and generally\nare not committed facilities. Factors\nconsidered in the review of margin loans are\nthe amount of the loan, the intended purpose,\nthe degree of leverage being employed in the\naccount and the amount of collateral, as well\nas an overall evaluation of the portfolio to\nensure proper diversification or, in the case\nof concentrated positions, appropriate\nliquidity of the underlying collateral or\npotential hedging strategies to reduce risk.\nUnderlying collateral for margin loans is\nreviewed with respect to the liquidity of the\nproposed collateral positions, valuation of\nsecurities, historic trading range, volatility\nanalysis and an evaluation of industry\nconcentrations.

Beginning in 2020,\ncommitments to central\ncounterparties are\npresented separately;\nthese commitments were\npreviously included in\nCorporate Lending\ncommitments and\nForward-starting\nsecured financing\nreceivables depending\non the type of\nagreement.\n\nSince commitments\nassociated with these\ninstruments may expire\nunused, the amounts\nshown do not\nnecessarily reflect\nthe actual future cash\nfunding requirements.\n\nTypes of Commitments\n\nLending Commitments.\nLending commitments\nprimarily represent\nthe notional amount of\nlegally binding\nobligations to provide\nfunding to clients for\ndifferent types of\nloan transactions. For\nsyndications that are\nled by the Firm, the\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed are net of the\namounts agreed to by\ncounterparties that\nwill participate in\nthe syndication. For\nsyndications that the\nFirm participates in\nand does not lead,\nlending commitments\naccepted by the\nborrower but not yet\nclosed include only\nthe amount that the\nFirm expects it will\nbe allocated from the\nlead syndicate bank.\nDue to the nature of\nthe Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder the commitments,\nthese amounts include\ncertain commitments\nparticipated to third\nparties.\n\nForward-Starting\nSecured Financing\nReceivables. This\namount includes\nsecurities purchased\nunder agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed that the Firm\nhas entered into prior\nto the balance sheet\ndate that will settle\nafter the balance\nsheet date. These\ntransactions are\nprimarily secured by\ncollateral from U.S.\ngovernment agency\nsecurities and other\nsovereign government\nobligations when they\nare funded.\nCentral Counterparty. These commitments relate\nto the Firm\u2019s membership in certain\nclearinghouses and are contingent upon the\ndefault of a clearinghouse member or other\nstress events. Underwriting Commitments. The\nFirm provides underwriting commitments in\nconnection with its capital raising sources to\na diverse group of corporate and other\ninstitutional clients. Investment Activities.\nThe Firm sponsors several non-consolidated\ninvestment management funds for third-party\ninvestors where it typically acts as general\npartner of, and investment advisor to, these\nfunds and typically commits to invest a\nminority of the capital of such funds, with\nsubscribing third-party investors contributing\nthe majority. The Firm has contractual capital\ncommitments, guarantees and counterparty\narrangements with respect to these investment\nmanagement funds. Letters of Credit and Other\nFinancial Guarantees. The Firm has outstanding\nletters of credit and other financial\nguarantees issued by third-party banks to\ncertain of the Firm\u2019s counterparties. The Firm\nis contingently liable for these letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees, which\nare primarily used to provide collateral for\nsecurities and commodities traded and to\nsatisfy various margin requirements in lieu of\ndepositing cash or securities with these\ncounterparties.\n                                  \n  125    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nGuarantees\nObligations under Guarantee Arrangements at\nDecember 31, 2020\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                        \u2026           \n         1       \u2026       3\u2026       5       T\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2026        \u2014       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026       3\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014       1\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       4\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014       24       \u2026       2\u2026  \n         \u2014       \u2014        \u2014       \u2026       6\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2026       32       \u2026       4\u2026  \n         \u2026       \u2014        \u2014       \u2014       87  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                    Carrying  \n                                      Amount  \n                                       Asset  \n  $ in millions                  (Liability)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit derivatives2         $        1,227  \n  Other credit contracts                  -4  \n  Non-credit derivatives2            -65,640  \n  Standby letters of                          \n  credit and other                       111  \n  financial                                   \n  guarantees issued1                          \n  Market value guarantees                  \u2014  \n  Liquidity facilities                     5  \n  Whole loan sales                         \u2014  \n  guarantees                                  \n  Securitization                              \n  representations and                    -42  \n  warranties3                                 \n  General partner                        -70  \n  guarantees                                  \n  Client clearing                          \u2014  \n  guarantees                                  \n                                              \n1.

The\nFirm evaluates\ncollateral\nrequirements for all\nderivatives, including\nderivatives that do\nnot meet the\naccounting definition\nof a guarantee. For\nthe effects of cash\ncollateral and\ncounterparty netting,\nsee Note 7. In certain\nsituations, collateral\nmay be held by the\nFirm for those\ncontracts that meet\nthe definition of a\nguarantee. Generally,\nthe Firm sets\ncollateral\nrequirements by\n\ncounterparty so that\nthe collateral covers\nvarious transactions\nand products and is\nnot allocated\nspecifically to\nindividual contracts.\nAlso, the Firm may\nrecover amounts\nrelated to the\nunderlying asset\ndelivered to the Firm\nunder the derivative\ncontract. Standby\nLetters of Credit and\nOther Financial\nGuarantees Issued. In\nconnection with its\ncorporate lending\nbusiness and other\ncorporate activities,\nthe Firm provides\nstandby letters of\ncredit and other\nfinancial guarantees\nto counterparties.\nSuch arrangements\nrepresent obligations\nto make payments to\nthird parties if the\ncounterparty fails to\nfulfill its obligation\nunder a borrowing\narrangement or other\ncontractual\nobligation. A majority\nof the Firm\u2019s standby\nletters of credit are\nprovided on behalf of\ncounterparties that\nare investment grade.\nIf the counterparty\nfails to fulfill its\ncontractual\nobligation, the Firm\nhas access to\ncollateral or recourse\nthat would approximate\nits obligation. Market\nValue Guarantees.\nMarket value\nguarantees are issued\nto guarantee timely\npayment of a specified\nreturn to investors in\ncertain affordable\nhousing tax credit\nfunds. These\nguarantees are\ndesigned to return an\ninvestor\u2019s\ncontribution to a fund\nand the investor\u2019s\nshare of tax losses\nand tax credits\nexpected to be\ngenerated by a fund.\nLiquidity Facilities.\nThe Firm has entered\ninto liquidity\nfacilities with SPEs\nand other\ncounterparties,\nwhereby the Firm is\nrequired to make\ncertain payments if\nlosses or defaults\noccur. Primarily, the\nFirm acts as liquidity\nprovider to municipal\nbond securitization\nSPEs and for\nstandalone municipal\nbonds in which the\nholders of beneficial\ninterests issued by\nthese SPEs or the\nholders of the\nindividual bonds,\nrespectively, have the\nright to tender their\ninterests for purchase\nby the Firm on\nspecified dates at a\nspecified price. The\nFirm often may have\nrecourse to the\nunderlying assets held\nby the SPEs in the\nevent payments are\nrequired under such\nliquidity facilities,\nas well as make-whole\nor recourse provisions\nwith the trust\nsponsors. The recourse\namount often exceeds\nthe maximum potential\npayout amount of the\nguarantee.\nSubstantially all of\nthe underlying assets\nin the SPEs are\ninvestment grade.\nLiquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal\ntender option bond\ntrusts are classified\nas derivatives. Whole\nLoan Sales Guarantees.\nThe Firm has provided,\nor otherwise agreed to\nbe responsible for,\nrepresentations and\nwarranties regarding\ncertain whole loan\nsales. Under certain\ncircumstances, the\nFirm may be required\nto repurchase such\nassets or make other\npayments related to\nsuch assets if such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties are\nbreached. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum potential\npayout related to such\nrepresentations and\nwarranties is equal to\nthe current UPB of\nsuch loans. Since the\nFirm no longer\nservices these loans,\nit has no information\non the current UPB of\nthose loans, and\naccordingly, the\namount included in the\nprevious table\nrepresents the UPB at\nthe time of the whole\nloan sale or at the\ntime when the Firm\nlast serviced any of\nthose loans. The\ncurrent UPB balances\ncould be substantially\nlower than the maximum\npotential payout\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    126  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \namount included in the previous table. The\nrelated liability primarily relates to sales\nof loans to the federal mortgage agencies.\nSecuritization Representations and Warranties.\nAs part of the Firm\u2019s Institutional Securities\nbusiness segment\u2019s securitizations and related\nactivities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for,\nrepresentations and warranties regarding\ncertain assets transferred in securitization\ntransactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent\nand nature of the representations and\nwarranties, if any, vary among different\nsecuritizations. Under certain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be required to repurchase certain\nassets or make other payments related to such\nassets if such representations and warranties\nare breached. The maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments the Firm could be required to\nmake would be equal to the current outstanding\nbalances of, or losses associated with, the\nassets subject to breaches of such\nrepresentations and warranties. The amount\nincluded in the previous table for the maximum\npotential payout includes the current UPB or\nhistorical losses where known, and the UPB at\nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not\nknown. General Partner Guarantees. As a\ngeneral partner in certain investment\nmanagement funds, the Firm receives certain\ndistributions from the partnerships when the\nreturn exceeds specified performance targets\naccording to the provisions of the partnership\nagreements. The Firm may be required to return\nall or a portion of such distributions to the\nlimited partners in the event the limited\npartners do not achieve a certain return as\nspecified in the various partnership\nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\nClient Clearing Guarantees. In 2019, the Firm\nbecame a sponsoring member of the Government\nSecurities Division of the FICC's Sponsored\nClearing Model. Clients of the Firm, as\nsponsored members, can transact in overnight\nsecurities repurchase and resale agreements,\nwhich are cleared through the FICC. As\nsponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the\nFICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its clients\u2019 obligations. In\n2020, the FICC\u2019s sponsored clearing model was\nupdated such that the Firm could be\nresponsible for liquidation of a sponsored\nmember\u2019s account and guarantees any resulting\nloss to the FICC in the event the sponsored\nmember fails to fully pay any net liquidation\namount due from the sponsored member to the\nFICC. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s maximum\npotential payout amount reflects the total of\nthe estimated net liquidation amounts for\nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes\ncredit exposure under this guarantee by\nobtaining a security interest in its sponsored\nmember clients\u2019 collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member\ntransactions. Therefore, the Firm's exposure\nis estimated to be an amount substantially\nlower than the maximum potential payout\namount. The collateral amount in which the\nFirm has a security interest is approximately\nequal to the maximum potential payout amount\nof the guarantee. Other Guarantees and\nIndemnities In the normal course of business,\nthe Firm provides guarantees and\nindemnifications in a variety of transactions.\nThese provisions generally are standard\ncontractual terms. Certain of these guarantees\nand indemnifications are described below: \u2022\nIndemnities . The Firm provides standard\nindemnities to counterparties for certain\ncontingent exposures and taxes, including U.S.\nand foreign withholding taxes, on interest and\nother payments made on derivatives, securities\nand stock lending transactions, certain\nannuity products and other financial\narrangements. These indemnity payments could\nbe required based on a change in the tax laws,\na change in interpretation of applicable tax\nrulings or a change in factual circumstances.\nCertain contracts contain provisions that\nenable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Firm could be required to make under\nthese indemnifications cannot be estimated. \u2022\nExchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The\nFirm is a member of various exchanges and\nclearinghouses that trade and clear securities\nand/or derivative contracts. Associated with\nits membership, the Firm may be required to\npay a certain amount as determined by the\nexchange or the clearinghouse in case of a\ndefault of any of its members or pay a\nproportionate share of the financial\nobligations of another member that may default\non its obligations to the exchange or the\nclearinghouse. While the rules governing\ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse\nmemberships and the forms of these guarantees\nmay vary, in general the Firm\u2019s obligations\nunder these rules would arise only if the\nexchange or clearinghouse had previously\nexhausted its resources. In addition, some\nclearinghouse rules require members to assume\na proportionate share of losses resulting from\nthe clearinghouse\u2019s investment of guarantee\nfund contributions and initial margin, and of\nother losses unrelated to the default of a\nclearing member, if such losses exceed the\nspecified resources allocated for such purpose\nby the clearinghouse. The maximum potential\npayout under these rules cannot be estimated.\nThe Firm has not recorded any contingent\nliability in its financial statements for\nthese agreements and believes that any\npotential requirement to make payments under\nthese agreements is remote. \u2022 Merger and\nAcquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from\ntime to time, in its role as investment\nbanking advisor be required to provide\nguarantees in connection with certain European\nmerger and acquisition transactions. If\nrequired by the regulating authorities, the\nFirm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in\nthe transaction has or will have sufficient\nfunds to complete the transaction and would\nthen be required to make the acquisition\npayments in the event\n                                  \n  127    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nthe acquirer\u2019s funds\nare insufficient at\nthe completion date of\nthe transaction. These\narrangements generally\ncover the time frame\nfrom the transaction\noffer date to its\nclosing date and,\ntherefore, are\ngenerally short term\nin nature. The Firm\nbelieves the\nlikelihood of any\npayment by the Firm\nunder these\narrangements is remote\ngiven the level of its\ndue diligence in its\nrole as investment\nbanking advisor. In\naddition, in the\nordinary course of\nbusiness, the Firm\nguarantees the debt\nand/or certain trading\nobligations (including\nobligations associated\nwith derivatives,\nforeign exchange\ncontracts and the\nsettlement of physical\ncommodities) of\ncertain subsidiaries.\nThese guarantees\ngenerally are entity\nor product specific\nand are required by\ninvestors or trading\ncounterparties. The\nactivities of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries\ncovered by these\nguarantees (including\nany related debt or\ntrading obligations)\nare included in the\nfinancial statements.\nContingencies Legal In\naddition to the\nmatters described in\nthe following\nparagraphs, in the\nnormal course of\nbusiness, the Firm has\nbeen named, from time\nto time, as a\ndefendant in various\nlegal actions,\nincluding\narbitrations, class\nactions and other\nlitigation, arising in\nconnection with its\nactivities as a global\ndiversified financial\nservices institution.\nCertain of the actual\nor threatened legal\nactions include claims\nfor substantial\ncompensatory and/or\npunitive damages or\nclaims for\nindeterminate amounts\nof damages. In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress. These\nactions have included,\nbut are not limited\nto, residential\nmortgage and credit\ncrisis-related\nmatters. While the\nFirm has identified\nbelow any individual\nproceedings where the\nFirm believes a\nmaterial loss to be\nreasonably possible\nand reasonably\nestimable, there can\nbe no assurance that\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nthose where potential\nlosses have not yet\nbeen determined to be\nprobable or possible,\nand reasonably\nestimable. The Firm\ncontests liability\nand/or the amount of\ndamages as appropriate\nin each pending\nmatter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\n                                              \n  $ in                                        \n  millions        2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Legal        $   336    $   221    $   206  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nThe Firm\u2019s legal\nexpenses can, and may\nin the future,\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible or to\nestimate the amount of\nany loss. In addition,\neven where a loss is\npossible or an\nexposure to loss\nexists in excess of\nthe liability already\naccrued with respect\nto a previously\nrecognized loss\ncontingency, it is not\nalways possible to\nreasonably estimate\nthe size of the\npossible loss or range\nof loss, particularly\nfor proceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss, or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss, can be\nreasonably estimated\nfor a proceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and by\naddressing novel or\nunsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. For certain\nother legal\nproceedings and\ninvestigations, the\nFirm can estimate\nreasonably possible\nlosses, additional\nlosses, ranges of loss\nor ranges of\nadditional loss in\nexcess of amounts\naccrued but does not\nbelieve, based on\ncurrent knowledge and\nafter consultation\nwith counsel, that\nsuch losses could have\na material adverse\neffect on the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements\nas a whole, other than\nthe matters referred\nto in the following\nparagraphs. On July\n15, 2010, China\nDevelopment Industrial\nBank (\u201cCDIB\u201d) filed a\ncomplaint against the\nFirm, styled China\nDevelopment Industrial\nBank v. Morgan Stanley\n& Co. Incorporated et\nal ., which is pending\nin the Supreme Court\nof the State of New\nYork, New York County\n(\u201cSupreme Court of\nNY\u201d). The complaint\nrelates to a $\n275million CDS\nreferencing the super\nsenior portion of the\nSTACK 2006-1 CDO. The\ncomplaint asserts\nclaims for common law\nfraud, fraudulent\ninducement and\nfraudulent concealment\nand alleges that the\nFirm misrepresented\nthe risks of the STACK\n2006-1 CDO to CDIB,\nand that the Firm knew\nthat the assets\nbacking the CDO were\nof poor quality when\nit entered into the\nCDS with CDIB. The\ncomplaint seeks\ncompensatory damages\nrelated to the\napproximately $\n228million that CDIB\nalleges it has already\nlost under the CDS,\nrescission of CDIB\u2019s\nobligation to pay an\nadditional $\n12million, punitive\ndamages, equitable\nrelief, fees and\ncosts. On February 28,\n2011, the court denied\nthe Firm\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the complaint.\nOn December 21, 2018,\nthe court denied the\nFirm\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment and\ngranted in part the\nFirm\u2019s motion for\nsanctions relating to\nspoliation of\nevidence. On January\n18, 2019, CDIB filed a\nmotion to clarify and\nresettle the portion\nof the court\u2019s\nDecember 21, 2018\norder granting\nspoliation sanctions.\nOn January 24, 2019,\nCDIB filed a notice of\nappeal from the\ncourt\u2019s December 21,\n2018 order, and the\nFirm filed a notice of\nappeal from the same\norder. On March 7,\n2019, the court denied\nthe relief sought by\nCDIB in its January\n18, 2019 motion. On\nMay 21, 2020, the\nAppellate Division,\nFirst Department\n(\u201cFirst Department\u201d),\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    128  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nmodified the Supreme Court of NY\u2019s order to\ndeny the Firm\u2019s motion for sanctions relating\nto spoliation of evidence and otherwise\naffirmed the denial of the Firm\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment. On June 19, 2020, the Firm\nmoved for leave to appeal the First\nDepartment\u2019s decision to the New York Court of\nAppeals (\u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d), which the First\nDepartment denied on July 24, 2020. Based on\ncurrently available information, the Firm\nbelieves it could incur a loss in this action\nof up to approximately $ 240million plus pre-\nand post-judgment interest, fees and costs. On\nSeptember 23, 2014, Financial Guaranty\nInsurance Company (\u201cFGIC\u201d) filed a complaint\nagainst the Firm in the Supreme Court of NY\nstyled Financial Guaranty Insurance Company v.\nMorgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. et al .\nrelating to the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I\nInc. Trust 2007-NC4. The complaint asserts\nclaims for breach of contract and fraudulent\ninducement and alleges, among other things,\nthat the loans in the trust breached various\nrepresentations and warranties and defendants\nmade untrue statements and material omissions\nto induce FGIC to issue a financial guaranty\npolicy on certain classes of certificates that\nhad an original balance of approximately $\n876million. The complaint seeks, among other\nrelief, specific performance of the loan\nbreach remedy procedures in the transaction\ndocuments, compensatory, consequential and\npunitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, interest\nand costs. On January 23, 2017, the court\ndenied the Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. On February 24, 2017, the Firm\nfiled a notice of appeal of the denial of its\nmotion to dismiss the complaint and perfected\nits appeal on November 22, 2017. On September\n13, 2018, the First Department affirmed in\npart and reversed in part the lower court\u2019s\norder denying the Firm\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. On December 20, 2018, the First\nDepartment denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave\nto appeal to the Court of Appeals or, in the\nalternative, for re-argument. Based on\ncurrently available information, the Firm\nbelieves that it could incur a loss in this\naction of up to approximately $ 277million,\nthe total original unpaid balance of the\nmortgage loans for which the Firm received\nrepurchase demands from a certificate holder\nand FGIC that the Firm did not repurchase,\nplus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees\nand costs, as well as claim payments that FGIC\nhas made and will make in the future. In\naddition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the\nnumber of loans at issue and the possible\nrange of loss could increase. On January 23,\n2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in\nits capacity as trustee, filed a complaint\nagainst the Firm styled Deutsche Bank National\nTrust Company solely in its capacity as\nTrustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I\nInc. Trust 2007-NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage\nCapital Holdings LLC as Successor-by-Merger to\nMorgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc., and\nMorgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. , pending in\nthe Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts\nclaims for breach of contract and alleges,\namong other things, that the loans in the\ntrust, which had an original principal balance\nof approximately $ 1.05billion, breached\nvarious representations and warranties. The\ncomplaint seeks, among other relief, specific\nperformance of the loan breach remedy\nprocedures in the transaction documents,\ncompensatory, consequential, rescissory,\nequitable and punitive damages, attorneys\u2019\nfees, costs and other related expenses, and\ninterest. On December 11, 2015, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part the Firm\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the complaint.

On\nJune 4, 2019, the First Department granted the\nFirm\u2019s motion for leave to appeal its January\n17, 2019 decision to the Court of Appeals. On\nMarch 19, 2020, the Firm filed a motion for\npartial summary judgment. Based on currently\navailable information, the Firm believes that\nit could incur a loss in this action of up to\napproximately $ 277million, the total original\nunpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which\nthe Firm received repurchase demands from a\ncertificate holder and a monoline insurer that\nthe Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and\npost-judgment interest, fees and costs, but\nplaintiff is seeking to expand the number of\nloans at issue and the possible range of loss\ncould increase. Tax In matters styled Case\nnumber 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the\nDutch Tax Authority (\u201cDutch Authority\u201d) is\nchallenging in the Dutch courts, the prior\nset-off by the Firm of approximately \u20ac\n124million (approximately $ 152million) plus\naccrued interest of withholding tax credits\nagainst the Firm\u2019s corporation tax liabilities\nfor the tax years 2007 to 2013. The Dutch\nAuthority alleges that the Firm was not\nentitled to receive the withholding tax\ncredits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm\nsubsidiary did not hold legal title to certain\nsecurities subject to withholding tax on the\nrelevant dates. The Dutch Authority has also\nalleged that the Firm failed to provide\ncertain information to the Dutch Authority and\nkeep adequate books and records. On April 26,\n2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a\ndecision dismissing the Dutch Authority\u2019s\nclaims with respect to certain of the tax\nyears in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court\nof Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch\nAuthority\u2019s appeal in matters re-styled Case\nnumber 18/00318 and Case number 18/00319 . On\nJune 22, 2020, the Firm filed an appeal\nagainst the decision of the Court of Appeal in\nAmsterdam before the Dutch High Court.\n                                  \n  129    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \n16. Variable Interest Entities and\nSecuritization Activities Overview The Firm is\ninvolved with various SPEs in the normal\ncourse of business. In most cases, these\nentities are deemed to be VIEs. The Firm\u2019s\nvariable interests in VIEs include debt and\nequity interests, commitments, guarantees,\nderivative instruments and certain fees. The\nFirm\u2019s involvement with VIEs arises primarily\nfrom: \u2022 Interests purchased in connection with\nmarket-making activities, securities held in\nits Investment securities portfolio and\nretained interests held as a result of\nsecuritization activities, including re-\nsecuritization transactions. \u2022 Guarantees\nissued and residual interests retained in\nconnection with municipal bond\nsecuritizations. \u2022 Loans made to and\ninvestments in VIEs that hold debt, equity,\nreal estate or other assets. \u2022 Derivatives\nentered into with VIEs. \u2022 Structuring of CLNs\nor other asset-repackaging notes designed to\nmeet the investment objectives of clients. \u2022\nOther structured transactions designed to\nprovide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or\nits clients. The Firm determines whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its\ninitial involvement with the VIE and\nreassesses whether it is the primary\nbeneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it\nhas any continuing involvement with the VIE.\nThis determination is based upon an analysis\nof the design of the VIE, including the VIE\u2019s\nstructure and activities, the power to make\nsignificant economic decisions held by the\nFirm and by other parties, and the variable\ninterests owned by the Firm and other parties.\nThe power to make the most significant\neconomic decisions may take a number of\ndifferent forms in different types of VIEs.\nThe Firm considers servicing or collateral\nmanagement decisions as representing the power\nto make the most significant economic\ndecisions in transactions such as\nsecuritizations or CDOs. As a result, the Firm\ndoes not consolidate securitizations or CDOs\nfor which it does not act as the servicer or\ncollateral manager unless it holds certain\nother rights to replace the servicer or\ncollateral manager or to require the\nliquidation of the entity. If the Firm serves\nas servicer or collateral manager, or has\ncertain other rights described in the previous\nsentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in\nthe VIE that it holds and consolidates only\nthose VIEs for which it holds a potentially\nsignificant interest in the VIE. For many\ntransactions, such as re-securitization\ntransactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging\nnotes, there are no significant economic\ndecisions made on an ongoing basis. In these\ncases, the Firm focuses its analysis on\ndecisions made\nprior to the initial\nclosing of the\ntransaction and at the\ntermination of the\ntransaction.

In\nmany securitization\ntransactions involving\ncommercial mortgage\nloans, the Firm\ntransfers a portion of\nthe assets to the SPE\nwith unrelated parties\ntransferring the\nremaining assets. In\naddition, mainly in\nsecuritization\ntransactions involving\nresidential mortgage\nloans, the Firm may\nalso enter into\nderivative\ntransactions,\nprimarily interest\nrate swaps or interest\nrate caps, with the\nSPE. Although not\nobligated, the Firm\ngenerally makes a\nmarket in the\nsecurities issued by\nSPEs in securitization\ntransactions. As a\nmarket maker, the Firm\noffers to buy these\nsecurities from, and\nsell these securities\nto, investors.\nSecurities purchased\nthrough these market-\nmaking activities are\nnot considered to be\nretained interests;\nthese beneficial\ninterests generally\nare included in\nTrading\nassets\u2014Corporate and\nother debt and are\nmeasured at fair\nvalue. The Firm enters\ninto derivatives,\ngenerally interest\nrate swaps and\ninterest rate caps,\nwith a senior payment\npriority in many\nsecuritization\ntransactions. The\nrisks associated with\nthese and similar\nderivatives with SPEs\nare essentially the\nsame as similar\nderivatives with non-\nSPE counterparties and\nare\n                                  \n  131    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall\nexposure. See Note 7 for further information\non derivative instruments and hedging\nactivities. Investment Securities The Firm\nholds securities issued by VIEs within the\nInvestment securities portfolio. These\nsecurities are composed of those related to\ntransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies and predominantly the most senior\nsecurities issued by VIEs backed by student\nloans and commercial mortgage loans.\nTransactions sponsored by the federal mortgage\nagencies include an explicit or implicit\nguarantee provided by the U.S. government.\nAdditionally, the Firm holds certain\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities issued\nby VIEs retained as a result of the Firm's\nsecuritization activities. See Note 8 for\nfurther information on the Investment\nsecurities portfolio. Municipal Tender Option\nBond Trusts In a municipal tender option bond\ntrust transaction, the client transfers a\nmunicipal bond to a trust. The trust issues\nshort-term securities that the Firm, as the\nremarketing agent, sells to investors. The\nclient generally retains a residual interest.\nThe short-term securities are supported by a\nliquidity facility pursuant to which the\ninvestors may put their short-term interests.\nIn most programs, a third-party provider will\nprovide such liquidity facility; in some\nprograms, the Firm provides this liquidity\nfacility. The Firm may, in lieu of purchasing\nshort-term securities for remarketing, decide\nto extend a temporary loan to the trust. The\nclient can generally terminate the transaction\nat any time. The liquidity provider can\ngenerally terminate the transaction upon the\noccurrence of certain events. When the\ntransaction is terminated, the municipal bond\nis generally sold or returned to the client.\nAny losses suffered by the liquidity provider\nupon the sale of the bond are the\nresponsibility of the client. This obligation\nis generally collateralized. Liquidity\nfacilities provided to municipal tender option\nbond trusts are classified as derivatives. The\nFirm consolidates any municipal tender option\nbond trusts in which it holds the residual\ninterest. Credit Protection Purchased through\nCredit-Linked Notes CLN transactions are\ndesigned to provide investors with exposure to\ncertain credit risk on referenced assets. In\nthese transactions, the Firm transfers assets\n(generally high-quality securities or money\nmarket investments) to an SPE, enters into a\nderivative transaction in which the SPE sells\nprotection on an unrelated referenced asset or\ngroup of assets, through a credit derivative,\nand sells the securities issued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may\nalso enter into interest rate or currency\nswaps with the SPE. Depending on the\nstructure, the assets and liabilities of the\nSPE may be consolidated and recognized in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheets or accounted for as a\nsale of assets. Upon the occurrence of a\ncredit event related to the referenced asset,\nthe SPE will deliver securities collateral as\npayment to the Firm, which exposes the Firm to\nchanges in the collateral\u2019s value. Derivative\npayments by the SPE are collateralized. The\nrisks associated with these and similar\nderivatives with SPEs are essentially the same\nas those with non-SPE counterparties and are\nmanaged as part of the Firm\u2019s overall\nexposure. Other Structured Financings The Firm\ninvests in interests issued by entities that\ndevelop and own low-income communities\n(including low-income housing projects) and\nentities that construct and own facilities\nthat will generate energy from renewable\nresources. The interests entitle the Firm to a\nshare of tax credits and tax losses generated\nby these projects. In addition, the Firm has\nissued guarantees to investors in certain low-\nincome housing funds. The guarantees are\ndesigned to return an investor\u2019s contribution\nto a fund and the investor\u2019s share of tax\nlosses and tax credits expected to be\ngenerated by the fund. The Firm is also\ninvolved with entities designed to provide\ntax-efficient yields to the Firm or its\nclients. Collateralized Loan and Debt\nObligations CLOs and CDOs are SPEs that\npurchase a pool of assets consisting of\ncorporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or\nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through\nderivatives, and issue multiple tranches of\ndebt and equity securities to investors. The\nFirm underwrites the securities issued in\ncertain CLO transactions on behalf of\nunaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory\nservices to these unaffiliated sponsors. The\nFirm sells corporate loans to many of these\nSPEs, in some cases representing a significant\nportion of the total assets purchased.\nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally\nmakes a market in the securities issued by\nSPEs in these transactions and may retain\nunsold securities. These beneficial interests\nare included in Trading assets and are\nmeasured at fair value. Equity-Linked Notes\nELN transactions are designed to provide\ninvestors with exposure to certain risks\nrelated to the specific equity security,\nequity index or other index. In an ELN\ntransaction, the Firm typically transfers to\nan SPE either a note issued by the Firm, the\npayments on which are linked to the\nperformance of a specific equity security,\nequity index or other index, or debt\nsecurities issued by other companies and a\nderivative contract, the terms of which will\nrelate to the performance of a specific equity\nsecurity, equity index or other index. These\nELN transactions with SPEs were not\nconsolidated at December 31, 2020 or December\n31, 2019.\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    132  \n

Regulatory\nRequirements\nRegulatory Capital\nFramework The Firm is\nan FHC under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of\n1956, as amended, and\nis subject to the\nregulation and\noversight of the Board\nof Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d).\nThe Federal Reserve\nestablishes\n                                  \n  133    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \n                                              \ncapital requirements\nfor the Firm,\nincluding well-\ncapitalized standards,\nand evaluates the\nFirm\u2019s compliance with\nsuch capital\nrequirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar\ncapital requirements\nand standards for the\nFirm\u2019s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries\nincluding, among\nothers, MSBNA and\nMSPBNA. The regulatory\ncapital requirements\nare largely based on\nthe Basel III capital\nstandards established\nby the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision\nand also implement\ncertain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and\nConsumer Protection\nAct. Regulatory\nCapital Requirements\nThe Firm is required\nto maintain minimum\nrisk-based and\nleverage-based capital\nratios under\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. A\nsummary of the\ncalculations of\nregulatory capital and\nRWA follows. Minimum\nrisk-based capital\nratio requirements\napply to Common Equity\nTier 1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and Total\ncapital (which\nincludes Tier 2\ncapital).

The CCyB can be set up to 2.5%, but is\ncurrently set by the U.S. banking agencies at\nzero.\n\n2. The capital buffer requirement represents\nthe amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital the\nFirm must maintain above the minimum risk-\nbased capital requirements in order to avoid\nrestrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to make\ncapital distributions, including the payment\nof dividends and the repurchase of stock, and\nto pay discretionary bonuses to executive\nofficers. Beginning October 1, 2020, the\nFirm\u2019s Standardized Approach capital buffer\nrequirement is equal to the sum of the SCB,\nG-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and the\nAdvanced Approach capital buffer requirement\nis equal to the 2.5% capital conservation\nbuffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.\n\n3. Required ratios represent the regulatory\nminimum plus the capital buffer requirement.\nRisk-Weighted Assets\nRWA reflects both the\nFirm\u2019s on- and off-\nbalance sheet risk, as\nwell as capital\ncharges attributable\nto the risk of loss\narising from the\nfollowing: \u2022 Credit\nrisk: The failure of a\nborrower, counterparty\nor issuer to meet its\nfinancial obligations\nto the Firm; \u2022 Market\nrisk: Adverse changes\nin the level of one or\nmore market prices,\nrates, indices,\nvolatilities,\ncorrelations or other\nmarket factors, such\nas market liquidity;\nand \u2022 Operational\nrisk: Inadequate or\nfailed processes or\nsystems, from human\nfactors or from\nexternal events ( e.g.\n, fraud, theft, legal\nand compliance risks,\ncyber attacks or\ndamage to physical\nassets). The Firm\u2019s\nrisk-based capital\nratios are computed\nunder both (i) the\nstandardized\napproaches for\ncalculating credit\nrisk and market risk\nRWA (\u201cStandardized\nApproach\u201d) and (ii)\nthe applicable\nadvanced approaches\nfor calculating credit\nrisk, market risk and\noperational risk RWA\n(\u201cAdvanced Approach\u201d).\nThe credit risk RWA\ncalculations between\nthe two approaches\ndiffer in that the\nStandardized Approach\nrequires calculation\nof RWA using\nprescribed risk\nweights, whereas the\nAdvanced Approach\nutilizes models to\ncalculate exposure\namounts and risk\nweights. At December\n31, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, the\ndifferences between\nthe actual and\nrequired ratio were\nlower under the\nStandardized Approach.\nMinimum leverage-based\ncapital requirements\ninclude a Tier 1\nleverage ratio and an\nSLR. The Firm is\nrequired to maintain a\nTier 1 SLR of 5%,\ninclusive of an\nenhanced SLR capital\nbuffer of at least 2%.\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    134  \n

For\nthe Firm to remain an\nFHC, its U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries must\nremain well-\ncapitalized in\naccordance with the\nOCC\u2019s PCA standards.\nIn addition, failure\nby the U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries to meet\nminimum capital\nrequirements may\nresult in certain\nmandatory and\ndiscretionary actions\nby regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have\na direct material\neffect on the U.S.\nbank subsidiaries\u2019 and\nthe Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements.

The U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nassets represent 87%\nof the Firm\u2019s total\npension plan assets.\nThe U.S. Qualified\nPlan uses a\ncombination of active\nand risk-controlled\nfixed income\ninvestment strategies.\nThe fixed income asset\nallocation consists\nprimarily of fixed\nincome securities and\nrelated derivative\ninstruments designed\nto approximate the\nexpected cash flows of\nthe plan\u2019s liabilities\nin order to help\nreduce plan exposure\nto interest rate\nvariation and to\nbetter align assets\nwith the obligation.\nThe longer-duration\nfixed income\nallocation is expected\nto help protect the\nplan\u2019s funded status\nand maintain the\nstability of plan\ncontributions over the\nlong run. The\ninvestment portfolio\nperformance is\nassessed by comparing\nactual investment\nperformance with\nchanges in the\nestimated present\nvalue of the U.S.\nQualified Plan\u2019s\nbenefit obligation.\nDerivative instruments\nare permitted in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio\nonly to the extent\nthat they comply with\nall of the plan\u2019s\ninvestment policy\nguidelines and are\nconsistent with the\nplan\u2019s risk and return\nobjectives. As a\nfundamental operating\nprinciple, any\nrestrictions on the\nunderlying assets\napply to the\nrespective derivative\nproduct. This includes\npercentage allocations\nand credit quality.\nDerivatives are used\nsolely for the purpose\nof enhancing\n\ninvestment returns in\nthe underlying assets\nand not to circumvent\nportfolio\nrestrictions. Plan\nassets are measured at\nfair value using\nvaluation techniques\nthat are consistent\nwith the valuation\ntechniques applied to\nthe Firm\u2019s major\ncategories of assets\nand liabilities as\ndescribed in Notes 2\nand 5. OTC derivative\ncontracts consist of\ninvestments in\ninterest rate swaps\nand total return\nswaps. Other\ninvestments consist of\npledged insurance\nannuity contracts held\nby non-U.S.-based\nplans. The pledged\ninsurance annuity\ncontracts are valued\nbased on the premium\nreserve of the insurer\nfor a guarantee that\nthe insurer has given\nto the employee\nbenefit plan that\napproximates fair\nvalue. The pledged\ninsurance annuity\ncontracts are\ncategorized in Level 3\nof the fair value\nhierarchy. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nprivately offered\nfunds regulated,\nsupervised and subject\nto periodic\nexamination by a U.S.\nfederal or state\nagency and available\nto institutional\nclients. The trust\nmust be maintained for\nthe collective\ninvestment or\nreinvestment of assets\ncontributed to it from\nU.S. tax-qualified\nemployee benefit plans\nmaintained by more\nthan one employer or\ncontrolled group of\ncorporations. The\nsponsor of the\ncommingled trust funds\nvalues the funds based\non the fair value of\nthe underlying\nsecurities. Commingled\ntrust funds are\nredeemable at NAV at\nthe measurement date\nor in the near future.\nSome non-U.S.-based\nplans hold foreign\nfunds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed\nincome funds, target\ncash flow funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed\nincome funds invest in\nindividual securities\nquoted on a recognized\nstock exchange or\ntraded in a regulated\nmarket. Certain fixed\nincome funds aim to\nproduce returns\nconsistent with\ncertain Financial\nTimes Stock Exchange\nindexes.

For\ninformation on the\nFirm\u2019s country risk\nexposure, see\n\u201cQuantitative and\nQualitative\nDisclosures about\nRisk\u2014Country and Other\nRisks.\u201d There can be\nsubstantial\ndifferences between\nour cross-border risk\nexposure and our\ncountry risk exposure.\nFor instance, unlike\nthe country risk\nexposure, our cross-\nborder risk exposure\ndoes not include the\neffect of certain risk\nmitigants. In\naddition, the basis\nfor determining the\ndomicile of the cross-\nborder risk exposure\nis different from the\nbasis for determining\nthe country risk\nexposure. Cross-border\nrisk exposure is\nreported based on the\ncountry of\njurisdiction for the\nobligor or guarantor.\nFor country risk\nexposure, we consider\nfactors in addition to\nthat of country of\njurisdiction,\nincluding physical\nlocation of operations\nor assets, location\n                                  \n  153    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                                         \n  Table of Contents                      \n  Financial Data Supplement (Unaudited)  \n                                         \nand source of cash\nflows or revenues, and\nlocation of collateral\n(if applicable), in\norder to determine the\nbasis for country risk\nexposure.

In\nmaking this\nassessment, management\nused the criteria set\nforth by the Committee\nof Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated\nFramework (2013).\nBased on management\u2019s\nassessment and those\ncriteria, management\nbelieves that the Firm\nmaintained effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as\nof December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s independent\nregistered public\naccounting firm has\naudited and issued a\nreport on the Firm\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\nwhich appears below.\n                                  \n  157    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n   Report of Independent Registered Public    \n               Accounting Firm                \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Morgan Stanley:\n                                              \n   Opinion on Internal Control over           \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nWe have audited the\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting of\nMorgan Stanley and\nsubsidiaries (the\n\u201cFirm\u201d) as of December\n31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established\nin Internal Control \u2014\nIntegrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the\nCommittee of\nSponsoring\nOrganizations of the\nTreadway Commission\n(COSO).

Those standards\nrequire that we plan\nand perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable\nassurance about\nwhether effective\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nwas maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our\naudit included\nobtaining an\nunderstanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting,\n\nassessing the risk\nthat a material\nweakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating\nthe design and\noperating\neffectiveness of\ninternal control based\non the assessed risk,\nand performing such\nother procedures as we\nconsidered necessary\nin the circumstances.\nWe believe that our\naudit provides a\nreasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\nDefinition and\nLimitations of\nInternal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting is a process\ndesigned to provide\nreasonable assurance\nregarding the\nreliability of\nfinancial reporting\nand the preparation of\nfinancial statements\nfor external purposes\nin accordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles.\nA company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes\nthose policies and\nprocedures that (1)\npertain to the\nmaintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the\ntransactions and\ndispositions of the\nassets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable\nassurance that\ntransactions are\nrecorded as necessary\nto permit preparation\nof financial\nstatements in\naccordance with\ngenerally accepted\naccounting principles,\nand that receipts and\nexpenditures of the\ncompany are being made\nonly in accordance\nwith authorizations of\nmanagement and\ndirectors of the\ncompany; and (3)\nprovide reasonable\nassurance regarding\nprevention or timely\ndetection of\nunauthorized\nacquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material\neffect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its\ninherent limitations,\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting\nmay not prevent or\ndetect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of\nany evaluation of\neffectiveness to\nfuture periods are\nsubject to the risk\nthat controls may\nbecome inadequate\nbecause of changes in\nconditions, or that\nthe degree of\ncompliance with the\npolicies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche\nLLP\nNew York, New York\n\nFebruary 26, 2021\n                                  \n  December 2020 Form 10-K    158  \n                                  \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                              \n   Changes in Internal Control Over           \n   Financial Reporting                        \n                                              \nNo change in the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting (as such\nterm is defined in\nExchange Act Rule\n13a-15(f)) occurred\nduring the quarter\nended December 31,\n2020 that materially\naffected, or is\nreasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the\nFirm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting.\n                                              \n  Other Information                           \n                                              \nNone.\n                                              \n  Unresolved Staff Comments                   \n                                              \nThe Firm, like other\nwell-known seasoned\nissuers, from time to\ntime receives written\ncomments from the\nstaff of the SEC\nregarding its periodic\nor current reports\nunder the Exchange\nAct.

In some\ncases, the entities\nthat would otherwise\nbe the primary\ndefendants in such\ncases are bankrupt or\nare in financial\ndistress.\n\nThe Firm is also\ninvolved, from time to\ntime, in other\nreviews,\ninvestigations and\nproceedings (both\nformal and informal)\nby governmental and\nself-regulatory\nagencies regarding the\nFirm\u2019s business, and\ninvolving, among other\nmatters, sales and\ntrading activities,\nfinancial products or\nofferings sponsored,\nunderwritten or sold\nby the Firm, and\naccounting and\noperational matters,\ncertain of which may\nresult in adverse\njudgments,\nsettlements, fines,\npenalties, injunctions\nor other relief.\n\nThe Firm contests\nliability and/or the\namount of damages as\nappropriate in each\npending matter. Where\navailable information\nindicates that it is\nprobable a liability\nhad been incurred at\nthe date of the\nfinancial statements\nand the Firm can\nreasonably estimate\nthe amount of that\nloss, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated loss by\na charge to income.\nThe Firm\u2019s future\nlegal expenses may\nfluctuate from period\nto period, given the\ncurrent environment\nregarding government\ninvestigations and\nprivate litigation\naffecting global\nfinancial services\nfirms, including the\nFirm.\n\nIn many proceedings\nand investigations,\nhowever, it is\ninherently difficult\nto determine whether\nany loss is probable\nor even possible, or\nto estimate the amount\nof any loss. The Firm\ncannot predict with\ncertainty if, how or\nwhen such proceedings\nor investigations will\nbe resolved or what\nthe eventual\nsettlement, fine,\npenalty or other\nrelief, if any, may\nbe, particularly for\nproceedings and\ninvestigations where\nthe factual record is\nbeing developed or\ncontested or where\nplaintiffs or\ngovernment entities\nseek substantial or\nindeterminate damages,\nrestitution,\ndisgorgement or\npenalties. Numerous\nissues may need to be\nresolved before a loss\nor additional loss or\nrange of loss or\nadditional range of\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated for a\nproceeding or\ninvestigation,\nincluding through\npotentially lengthy\ndiscovery and\ndetermination of\nimportant factual\nmatters, determination\nof issues related to\nclass certification\nand the calculation of\ndamages or other\nrelief, and by\naddressing novel or\nunsettled legal\nquestions relevant to\nthe proceedings or\ninvestigations in\nquestion. Subject to\nthe foregoing, the\nFirm believes, based\non current knowledge\nand after consultation\nwith counsel, that the\noutcome of such\nproceedings and\ninvestigations will\nnot have a material\nadverse effect on the\nfinancial condition of\nthe Firm, although the\noutcome of such\nproceedings or\ninvestigations could\nbe material to the\nFirm\u2019s operating\nresults and cash flows\nfor a particular\nperiod depending on,\namong other things,\nthe level of the\nFirm\u2019s revenues or\nincome for such\nperiod.\n\nWhile the Firm has\nidentified below\ncertain proceedings\nthat the Firm believes\nto be material,\nindividually or\ncollectively, there\ncan be no assurance\nthat additional\nmaterial losses will\nnot be incurred from\nclaims that have not\nyet been asserted or\nare not yet determined\nto be material.\n\nResidential Mortgage\nand Credit Crisis\nRelated Matters\n\nOn July 15, 2010,\nChina Development\nIndustrial Bank\n(\u201cCDIB\u201d) filed a\ncomplaint against the\nFirm, styled China\nDevelopment Industrial\nBank v.

The complaint\nrelates to a $275\nmillion CDS\nreferencing the super\nsenior portion of the\nSTACK 2006-1 CDO. The\ncomplaint asserts\nclaims for common law\nfraud, fraudulent\ninducement and\nfraudulent concealment\nand alleges that the\nFirm misrepresented\nthe risks of the STACK\n2006-1 CDO to CDIB,\nand that the Firm knew\nthat the assets\nbacking the CDO were\nof poor quality when\nit entered into\n                                  \n  159    December 2020 Form 10-K  \n                                  \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nthe CDS with CDIB.
