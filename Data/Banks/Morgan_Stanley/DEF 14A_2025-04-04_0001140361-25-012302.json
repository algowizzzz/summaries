   PERFORMANCE-BASED APPROACH TO       \n          COMPENSATION                        \n          The CMDS Committee uses a           \n          well-defined framework for          \n          determining executive compensation  \n          to ensure that Morgan Stanley\u2019s     \n          compensation program delivers pay   \n          for sustainable performance,        \n          aligns compensation with            \n          shareholders\u2019 interests, is         \n          motivating and competitive, and     \n          reflects shareholder input and      \n          best practices. As in prior years,  \n          the CMDS Committee established      \n          financial and non-financial         \n          performance priorities based on     \n          the Firm\u2019s strategic objectives     \n          and a target compensation range     \n          for the CEO at the beginning of     \n          the year, assessed Firm and CEO     \n          performance after the end of the    \n          year against the pre-determined     \n          performance priorities and          \n          strategic objectives, and           \n          determined compensation with        \n          shareholder-aligned features based  \n          on that performance assessment.     \n          The CMDS Committee assessed Mr.\u00a0    \n          Pick\u2019s and the Firm\u2019s 2024          \n          performance against predetermined   \n          performance priorities and          \n          strategic objectives as             \n          exceptional, including Mr.\u00a0Pick\u2019s   \n          successful completion of the        \n          leadership transition and           \n          reporting strong financial results  \n          that reflect execution of a clear   \n          and consistent long-term strategy   \n          focused on driving revenue, strong  \n          capital, liquidity and earnings,    \n          maintaining expense discipline,     \n          investing in risk and controls      \n          across the Firm, and delivering     \n          the full, integrated Firm to        \n          clients.                            \n          Under Mr.\u00a0Pick\u2019s leadership, for    \n          2024:                               \n          \u2022The Firm achieved strong           \n          financial performance across        \n          revenues, net income and EPS.       \n          \u2022Firm net revenues were a record    \n          at $61.8\u00a0billion (up approximately  \n          14% year-over-year) with net\u00a0       \n          income\u00a0applicable to Morgan         \n          Stanley of approximately $13.4\u00a0     \n          billion, and EPS of $7.95.          \n          \u2022The Firm delivered pre-tax profit  \n          of $17.6\u00a0billion (up approximately  \n          49% year-over-year).                \n          \u2022The Firm reported full-year ROTCE  \n          of 18.8% and an efficiency ratio    \n          of 71%, making progress toward our  \n          Firmwide goals.                     \n          \u2022The CET1 Ratio at December\u00a031,     \n          2024 was 15.9% and the Firm         \n          accreted $5.6\u00a0billion of CET1       \n          capital while supporting our        \n          clients, continuing to grow our     \n          dividend, and returning capital to  \n          shareholders.                       \n          \u2022The quarterly dividend was         \n          increased $0.075 to $0.925 in the   \n          third quarter, with total           \n          dividends of $5.7\u00a0billion paid in   \n          2024.                               \n          \u2022The Firm retained its premium      \n          valuation and continued to          \n          increase returns to shareholders,   \n          delivering total shareholder        \n          returns of 40% over the one-year    \n          period.

In addition, the     \nCorporate Governance Policies provide that the\nBoard expects a director to advise and to     \noffer to tender his or her resignation for    \nconsideration by the Board if his or her      \nprincipal occupation or employer changes. The \nG&S Committee reviews a director\u2019s change in  \ncircumstances and time commitment to the Board\nthroughout the year, including as part of the \nannual evaluation process, and considers a    \ndirector\u2019s other time commitments, including  \nservice on other public company boards, when  \nrecommending the director nominees for        \nelection by shareholders at an annual meeting.\nThe Corporate Governance Policies also provide\nthat a director candidate should not be       \nnominated for election if the candidate would \nbe 75 years old or older at the time of       \nelection.

As part of the Board\u2019s ongoing     \nreview of Board composition and succession    \nplanning, an independent director recommended \nDouglas L.

The\nG&S Committee oversees an orientation program \nfor new directors, which includes an overview \nof director duties, our Corporate Governance  \nPolicies, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct \nand other applicable policies. New directors  \nalso receive presentations by senior          \nmanagement on the Firm\u2019s strategy and         \nregulatory framework, its primary business    \nlines, and risk and control framework, and    \nhave a one-on-one session with the Chairman   \nand CEO. As directors are appointed to new    \ncommittees or assume a leadership role, such  \nas committee chair, they receive additional   \norientation sessions specific to such         \nresponsibilities. We also conduct ongoing     \neducational briefings on regulatory and       \ncontrol matters, as well as \u201cdeep dive\u201d       \npresentations on certain businesses, emerging \nrisks and focus areas identified by the Board.\nIn addition, we provide directors a listing of\neducational resources and reimburse directors \nfor reasonable costs incurred attending       \neducational sessions on subjects that would   \nassist them in discharging their duties.      \nSenior Management Succession and Development  \nPlanning The CMDS Committee oversees CEO and  \nsenior management succession and development  \nplanning, which covers unexpected as well as  \nplanned events and is formally reviewed, in   \nconjunction with the entire Board, at least   \nannually. Our CEO and our Co-Chief Human      \nResources Officers review recommendations and \nevaluations of potential internal CEO and     \nsenior management successors, and their       \nqualifications, skills, accomplishments and   \ndevelopmental areas. Potential internal CEO   \nand senior management successors regularly    \nattend Board meetings and engage with Board   \nmembers periodically between Board meetings,  \nincluding during preparatory meetings, client-\nrelated events and visits to our offices      \naround the world. These interactions provide  \nthe Board with the opportunities to become    \nfamiliar with the Firm\u2019s executive talent in  \ndifferent settings, which is critical to the  \nFirm\u2019s succession planning. The goal of       \nsuccession planning deeper into the           \norganization is to ensure that the Firm has a \nbench of well-rounded and capable talent.     \nCareer development is purposeful and intended \nto set the Firm up for long-term future       \nsuccess. The Board believes its succession    \nplanning process has demonstrated the world-  \nclass quality and depth of Morgan Stanley\u2019s   \nleadership talent and has resulted in the     \nappointment of an outstanding CEO and two     \nstrong Co-Presidents who continue to execute  \nthe Firm\u2019s long-term strategy and achieve     \nexceptional performance. Effective December   \n31, 2024, following the successful completion \nof the CEO and leadership transition, Mr.     \nGorman stepped down as Executive Chairman, Mr.\nPick became Chairman of the Board and various \nother senior leadership appointments were made\nto continue developing our senior leaders. In \nJanuary 2025, Michael Pizzi assumed           \nresponsibility for Operations globally, in    \naddition to his role as Global Head of        \nTechnology, and Mandell Crawley assumed       \nresponsibility as Chief Client Officer for    \nIntegrated Firm Management, a new organization\nto ensure a consistent and systematic delivery\nof Morgan Stanley\u2019s comprehensive solution set\nin partnership with the business units. Annual\nEvaluation of Board, Committees and           \nIndependent Lead Director OVERVIEW OF         \nEVALUATION PROCESS The Board believes that    \nestablishing and maintaining a constructive   \nevaluation process is essential to maintaining\nBoard effectiveness and best corporate        \ngovernance practices. Accordingly, the G&S    \nCommittee reviews and approves the evaluation \nprocess annually so that the evaluation       \nprocess continues to be effective in          \nidentifying areas to enhance the performance  \nand effectiveness of the Board, the           \nIndependent Lead Director and the Board       \ncommittees.                                   \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT27  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nMULTI-STEP EVALUATION PROCESS This process is \naided by written discussion guides used to    \nfacilitate the evaluations.

The Board believes that a      \ndirector\u2019s total compensation should include a\nsignificant equity component because it       \nbelieves that this more closely aligns the    \nlong-term interests of directors with those of\nshareholders and provides a continuing        \nincentive for directors to foster the Firm\u2019s  \nsuccess. In furtherance of these goals, our   \ndirectors are bound by a shareholder-approved \nannual compensation (cash and equity) limit of\n$750,000 and an equity ownership requirement  \nof five times the annual cash Board retainer  \n(as described in more detail below under      \n\u201cDirector Equity Ownership Requirement\u201d).     \nDirectors\u2019 compensation for service on the    \nBoard is determined by the Board, and the G&S \nCommittee makes recommendations to the Board  \nbased on periodic benchmarking assessments and\nadvice received from FW Cook, its independent \nadvisor. In 2024, FW Cook conducted a         \ncustomized review of the design and pay levels\nof our director compensation program compared \nto competitive market practices. Effective    \nNovember 1, 2024, based on the recommendation \nof the G&S Committee following its review with\nFW Cook, the Board increased the value of the \nannual equity award by $15,000 and the annual \nBoard retainer by $15,000.                    \n                                         \n  48MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nThe following table contains information with \nrespect to the annual compensation (including \ndeferred compensation) of our non-employee    \ndirectors earned during 2024 with respect to  \ntheir Board service.                          \n                                              \n                         Cha\u2026                 \n         Fees            in                   \n         Ear\u2026            Pen\u2026                 \n           or    Sto\u2026    Val\u2026    All          \n  Di\u2026    Paid    Awa\u2026    and     Ot\u2026    Tot\u2026  \n           in    ($)\u2026    Non\u2026    Co\u2026     ($)  \n         Cash            Def\u2026    ($)          \n         ($)\u2026            Com\u2026                 \n                         Ear\u2026                 \n                         ($)                  \n  Me\u2026    69,\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u200b22\u2026    \u200b554\u2026  \n  Bu\u2026                                         \n  Th\u2026                                         \n  H.     202\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      462\u2026  \n  Gl\u2026                                         \n  Ro\u2026                                         \n  H.     142\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      402\u2026  \n  He\u2026                                         \n  Er\u2026                                         \n  H.     102\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      362\u2026  \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n  Sh\u2026                                         \n  B.     102\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      362\u2026  \n  Le\u2026                                         \n  St\u2026                                         \n  J.     92,\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      352\u2026  \n  Lu\u2026                                         \n  Ja\u2026    132\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      392\u2026  \n  Mi\u2026                                         \n  De\u2026                                         \n  M.     132\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      392\u2026  \n  Na\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026                                         \n  L.     102\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      362\u2026  \n  Sc\u2026                                         \n  Pe\u2026                                         \n  M.     142\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      402\u2026  \n  Tr\u2026                                         \n  Ra\u2026                                         \n  Wi\u2026    132\u2026    260\u2026    \u2014       \u2014      392\u2026  \n  Jr.                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     Ms.\u00a0Butler joined the Board effective    \n     May\u00a023, 2024, and Mr.\u00a0Luczo concluded    \n     service on the Board effective December  \n  *  31, 2024.                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Messrs.

Deloitte was selected as        \nindependent auditor upon the merger creating  \nthe current Firm in 1997 and has served       \ncontinuously as independent auditor since that\ntime. Deloitte will audit the Firm\u2019s          \nconsolidated financial statements included in \nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year   \nending December 31, 2025, and will perform    \nother permissible, pre-approved services. If  \nshareholders do not ratify the appointment of \nDeloitte, the Audit Committee will consider   \nthis in determining whether to appoint        \nDeloitte as independent auditor for the year  \nending December 31, 2026. Even if the         \nappointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, \nin its discretion, may change the appointment \nat any time during the year if it determines  \nthat such a change would be in the best       \ninterest of the Firm and its shareholders.    \nDeloitte representatives will attend the      \nannual meeting. They will be present to       \nrespond to appropriate shareholder questions  \nand will have the opportunity to make a       \nstatement if they desire to do so. Our Board  \nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201dthe \nratification of Deloitte\u2019s appointment as our \nindependent auditor. Proxies solicited by the \nBoard will be voted \u201cFOR\u201dthis ratification    \nunless otherwise instructed.                  \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT53  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                 \n  Audit Matters  \n                 \nAudit Committee Report The Audit Committee\u2019s  \ncharter, available at                         \nwww.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance,    \nprovides that the Audit Committee is          \nresponsible for the oversight of the integrity\nof the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial          \nstatements, the Firm\u2019s system of internal     \ncontrol over financial reporting, certain     \naspects of the Firm\u2019s risk management as      \ndescribed in the charter, the qualifications  \nand independence of the independent registered\naccounting firm engaged as the \u201cindependent   \nauditor,\u201d the performance of the Firm\u2019s       \ninternal auditor and independent auditor, and \nthe Firm\u2019s compliance with legal and          \nregulatory requirements.

The Audit Committee   \npre-approves categories of audit and permitted\nnon-audit services that Deloitte may perform  \nfor the Firm and sets budgeted fee levels for \nsuch services. The Firm reviews proposed      \nengagements, in conjunction with Deloitte, to \nconfirm the proposed engagements fit within a \ncategory of pre-approved services and such    \nengagements are documented and reported to the\nAudit Committee on a quarterly basis. Any     \nproposed service category, engagement or      \nbudgeted fee adjustment that has not been pre-\napproved by the Audit Committee may be        \napproved by the Audit Committee Chair between \nregularly scheduled quarterly meetings and    \nreported to the Audit Committee at its next   \nquarterly meeting.

We have a   \nlong history of strong shareholder support for\nour Board\u2019s compensation philosophy, as       \nevidenced by average support for our \u201cSay on  \nPay\u201d proposals of 93% from 2014 to 2023. At   \nthe 2024 annual meeting, approximately 75% of \nthe approximately 1.3 billion votes cast      \nfavored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. The key    \nchange in our compensation program between    \n2023 and 2024 was the grant of a one-time     \nequity Staking Award to each of the incoming  \nCEO and Co-Presidents in the Fall of 2023 in  \nconnection with the CEO succession and        \nleadership transition process. The Staking    \nAwards allowed the Firm to address            \nshareholders\u2019 concerns, make senior management\ntransitions without disrupting the positive   \nmomentum achieved over the years in evolving  \nthe Firm\u2019s strategy and creating long-term    \nshareholder value, and achieve full leadership\ncontinuity following an internal CEO          \ntransition, an atypical outcome in the        \nfinancial industry. In anticipation of        \nshareholder questions regarding our approach  \nto the CEO succession and leadership          \ntransition process in 2023, and in light of   \nour 2024 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote falling below our  \nhistoric average and to ascertain the reasons \nfor the decline, we deliberately increased    \nshareholder engagement efforts.Shareholders   \nwho provided feedback during our engagement   \nprogram generally emphasized their support for\nthe Firm\u2019s leadership team, the Firm\u2019s        \nstrategy and long-term performance, and the   \nFirm\u2019s annual compensation program for        \nexecutives. Many shareholders also praised the\nquality of the Firm\u2019s disclosure and reported \nthat the CMDS Committee\u2019s use of discretion in\nthe administration of the executive           \ncompensation program is reasonable and that   \nthe general structure of our compensation     \nprogram is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. Some shareholders, however,      \nraised concerns regarding the one-time equity \nawards granted during 2023. The CMDS Committee\nfactored this shareholder feedback, including \nthe \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote results with respect to \n2023 compensation, into its consideration of  \nthe executive compensation structure and      \ndetermination of 2024 NEO pay levels and      \nfuture grant practices, and we note that no   \none-time awards were granted to our NEOs for  \n2024.                                         \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT57  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nAs discussed in the CD&A, the 2024 pay        \ndecision for the CEO was made by the CMDS     \nCommittee in consultation with the Board,     \nbased on an evaluation of 2024 Firm and CEO   \nperformance against predetermined performance \npriorities and strategic objectives as        \nexceptional, including Mr. Pick\u2019s successful  \ncompletion of the leadership transition and   \nreporting strong financial results that       \nreflect execution of a clear and consistent   \nlong-term strategy focused on driving revenue,\nstrong capital, liquidity and earnings,       \nmaintaining expense discipline, investing in  \nrisk and controls across the Firm, and        \ndelivering the full, integrated Firm to       \nclients.

ESTABLISH TARGET COMPENSATION \nRANGE Each year, the CMDS Committee           \nestablishes a target compensation range for   \nthe CEO and outlines guidelines for the CEO   \nperformance assessment at year end. At the    \nstart of 2024, the CMDS Committee, in         \nconsultation with its independent compensation\nconsultant, Semler Brossy, established a      \ntarget range for CEO compensation as well as  \nthe factors to be considered in determining   \nyear-end compensation. The CMDS Committee     \nmaintained a range for 2024 CEO pay of $40    \nmillion or more for strong performance        \nexceeding expectations to $20 million or less \nfor performance below expectations. To inform \nits decision-making with respect to the       \nappropriate target range, the CMDS Committee  \nconsiders compensation information for        \nselected financial companies in the S&P 100   \nIndex, as described in Section 3.1 \u201cFactors   \nConsidered in Compensation                    \nDeterminations\u2014Benchmarking Target CEO Pay.\u201d  \n3.

This amount differs   \n      from the SEC required disclosure in     \n      the \u201c2024 Summary Compensation Table.\u201d  \n                                              \nAnnual NEO pay, including that of our CEO, in \na given year is typically delivered in a      \ncombination of fixed compensation (base       \nsalary), cash bonus, and deferred incentive   \ncompensation provided in time-vested deferred \nrestricted stock units (RSUs) and a long-term \nincentive program award in the form of        \nperformance-vested stock units (PSUs), with   \nthe same key features as the CEO compensation \nelements. In determining the portions of      \ncompensation to award as cash bonus, deferred \nincentive compensation, RSUs and PSUs, the    \nCMDS Committee considers applicable regulatory\nrequirements and guidelines for deferral, as  \nwell as market practices and shareholder      \nfeedback. A significant portion of pay is     \ndeferred, all of which is awarded in equity,  \nsubject to future stock price performance and \ncancellation and clawback and, in the case of \nPSUs, future achievement of specified         \nfinancial objectives over a three-year period.\nThe CMDS Committee believes that emphasizing  \nequity in the compensation mix aligns         \nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of           \nshareholders by fostering a focus on the      \nFirm\u2019s long-term success while discouraging   \nexcessive risk-taking. Additionally, a        \ncompetitive annual cash incentive opportunity \nserves as a strong motivator for performance. \nSection 3.2 contains more details about       \nindividual NEO performance. Section 4.1       \ncontains the 2024 compensation decisions for  \neach NEO, which follows a similar performance \nevaluation process as for the CEO.            \n

We highly value  \nengaging with our shareholders and have a     \ndemonstrable history of being responsive to   \ntheir feedback. We have a long history of     \nstrong shareholder support for our Board\u2019s    \ncompensation philosophy, as evidenced by      \naverage support for our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposals\nof 93% from 2014 to 2023. At the 2024 annual  \nmeeting, 75% of the approximately 1.3 billion \nvotes cast favored our \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. \nThe key change in our compensation program    \nbetween 2023 and 2024 was the grant of a one- \ntime equity Staking Award to each of the      \nincoming CEO and Co-Presidents in the Fall of \n2023. In consultation with its                \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT67  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nindependent compensation consultant, Semler   \nBrossy, the CMDS Committee approved the one-  \ntime equity award to each of Messrs. Pick,    \nSaperstein, and Simkowitz in connection with  \nthe CEO succession and leadership transition  \nprocess. The Staking Awards allowed the Firm  \nto address shareholders\u2019 concerns, make senior\nmanagement transitions without disrupting the \npositive momentum achieved over the years in  \nevolving the Firm\u2019s strategy and creating     \nlong-term shareholder value, and achieve full \nleadership continuity following an internal   \nCEO transition, an atypical outcome in the    \nfinancial industry. In anticipation of        \nshareholder questions regarding our approach  \nto the CEO succession and leadership          \ntransition process in 2023, and in light of   \nour 2024 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote falling below our  \nhistoric average and to ascertain the reasons \nfor the decline, we deliberately increased    \nshareholder engagement efforts. Over the Fall \nof 2023 (after the announcement of the Staking\nAwards in October) and full-year 2024, we     \nreached out to shareholders holding over 74%  \nof Shares Outstanding (Unaligned) and         \nshareholders holding approximately 44% of     \nShares Outstanding (Unaligned) accepted our   \ninvitation to meet .Additionally, our Lead    \nIndependent Director and/or our Chair of the  \nCMDS Committee led engagements with many of   \nour largest shareholders. Shareholders who    \nprovided feedback during our engagement       \nprogram generally emphasized their support for\nthe Firm\u2019s leadership team, the Firm\u2019s        \nstrategy and long-term performance, and the   \nFirm\u2019s annual compensation program for        \nexecutives. Many shareholders also praised the\nquality of the Firm\u2019s disclosure and reported \nthat the CMDS Committee\u2019s use of discretion in\nthe administration of the executive           \ncompensation program is reasonable and that   \nthe general structure of our compensation     \nprogram is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. Some shareholders, however,      \nraised concerns regarding the one-time equity \nawards granted during 2023. The CMDS Committee\nfactored this shareholder feedback, including \nthe \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote results with respect to \n2023 compensation, into its consideration of  \nthe executive compensation structure and      \ndetermination of 2024 NEO pay levels and      \nfuture grant practices, and we note that no   \none-time awards were granted to our NEOs for  \n2024.

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives     \nMorgan Stanley is committed to responsible and\neffective compensation programs. The Firm's   \ncompensation philosophy is fundamental to our \ngoals of attracting, retaining, and motivating\nour workforce in a competitive market.

The CMDS Committee continually     \nevaluates the Firm\u2019s compensation programs    \nwith a view toward balancing the following key\nobjectives, all of which support the Firm\u2019s   \nculture and values, and shareholders\u2019         \ninterests. As discussed in the \u201cCompensation  \nGovernance and Risk Management\u201d section of    \nthis proxy statement, the CMDS Committee is   \nalso committed to integrating risk management \ninto

Framework for Making Compensation Decisions\n3.1 Factors Considered in Compensation        \nDecisions The 2024 compensation of the NEOs   \nwas determined by the CMDS Committee after    \nconsideration of Firm business results,       \nstrategic performance, and individual         \nperformance (including from a risk management \nperspective), as well as competitor           \ncompensation data and, with respect to the    \nCEO, benchmarking data, and other             \nconsiderations set forth below. The CMDS      \nCommittee regularly reviews (i) Firm          \nperformance with respect to execution of      \nstrategic objectives and evaluates executive  \nperformance in light of such performance; (ii)\nexecutive compensation strategy, including the\ncompetitive environment and the design and    \nstructure of the Firm\u2019s compensation programs \nto ensure that they are consistent with and   \nsupport our compensation objectives; and (iii)\nmarket trends and legislative and regulatory  \ndevelopments affecting compensation in the    \nUnited States and globally. The CMDS Committee\napproves executive annual incentive           \ncompensation after a comprehensive review and \nevaluation of Firm, business unit and         \nindividual performance for the year, and      \nreviews these compensation decisions with our \nBoard. PERFORMANCE PRIORITIES For 2024, a     \nnumber of quantitative and qualitative        \nperformance priorities were set by the CMDS   \nCommittee and the Board at the beginning of   \nthe year. The performance priorities are      \nestablished based on a directional assessment \nmade at the beginning of the year in light of \nthe market environment and the Firm\u2019s         \nstrategic objectives, and their attainment or \nnon-attainment does not correspond to any     \nspecific compensation decision. To inform its \ndecision-making process for NEO compensation  \nfor 2024, the CMDS Committee evaluated Firm   \nand individual performance in light of the    \npre-established performance priorities. See   \nSection 1.2 \u201cFramework for CEO Compensation   \nDecision\u201d and Section 3.2 \u201cEvaluating Firm and\nIndividual Performance for Alignment with     \nExecutive Compensation.\u201d                      \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT69  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nFor 2024, the CMDS Committee reviewed         \nperformance priorities in the following areas:\n                \n  QUANTITATIVE  \n                \n               \n  QUALITATIVE  \n               \nRISK MANAGEMENT The Firm maintains strong risk\nmanagement policies and considers the risk    \nattributes of the Firm\u2019s incentive            \ncompensation arrangements and incorporates    \nfinancial and non-financial risk management   \nperformance factors, including conduct risk,  \nin making compensation decisions. For a       \ndescription of the Firm\u2019s processes for taking\nrisk management into consideration in         \ncompensation decisions, see \u201cCompensation     \nGovernance and Risk Management.\u201d COMPENSATION \nMARKET DATA During 2024, the CMDS Committee   \nreviewed analyses of our competitors\u2019 pay     \nlevels, including historical compensation data\nobtained from public filings and compensation \nsurveys conducted by consultants on an        \nunattributed basis, as well as compensation   \nplan design. While market data provides the   \nCMDS Committee with useful information        \nregarding our competitors, the CMDS Committee \ndoes not target specific pay positioning      \n(e.g., a specific percentile), nor does it use\na formulaic approach in determining           \ncompetitive pay levels. Instead, the CMDS     \nCommittee uses the data as a reference, which \nis considered in the context of each NEO\u2019s    \nperformance over a multi-year period, and the \nCMDS Committee\u2019s assessment of the value the  \nindividual delivers to the Firm. The Firm uses\na Comparison Group to understand market       \npractices and trends, evaluate the            \ncompetitiveness of our compensation programs, \nand inform compensation decisions. Our        \nComparison Group consists of companies that   \neither directly compete with the Firm for     \nbusiness and/or talent or are global          \norganizations with scope, size, or other      \ncharacteristics similar to those of the Firm. \nThere were no changes to our Comparison Group \nfor 2024.                                     \n                    \n  COMPARISON GROUP  \n                    \n                                       \n  Bank of America Corp.

To inform its \ndecision-making with respect to the           \nappropriate target range, the CMDS Committee  \nreviewed available 2023 compensation levels   \nfor selected financial companies in the S&P   \n100 Index, which are intended to reflect      \ninstitutions of similar size, scope, and      \ncomplexity. There were no changes to the S&P  \n100 Index financial companies utilized for    \nbenchmarking purposes for 2024. The CMDS      \nCommittee then utilized the range of results  \nas a benchmark from which to set the target   \nrange for 2024 compensation for the CEO.      \n                                              \n  SELECTED FINANCIAL COMPANIES IN THE S&P     \n  100 INDEX                                   \n                                              \n                                       \n  Bank of America Corp.

Our goal is to be in a position\nfor the Board to appoint our most senior      \nexecutives from within our Firm and to        \nincentivize our people to aspire to senior    \nexecutive roles. At year end, the CMDS        \nCommittee reviewed the relative differences   \nbetween the compensation for the CEO and other\nNEOs and between the NEOs and other members of\nthe Operating Committee. Pay decisions were   \ndetermined based on the NEO\u2019s position during \n2024 and not in consideration of positions    \neffective as of January 1, 2025; compensation \ndecisions for 2025 performance will be made   \nafter 2025 performance is known using the CMDS\nCommittee\u2019s compensation framework described  \nherein. INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE    \nCEO, INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AND INDEPENDENT   \nCONSULTANT At the end of the year, Mr. Pick   \npresented the CMDS Committee with performance \nassessments and compensation recommendations  \nfor each NEO, other than himself and the      \nExecutive Chairman. The performance assessment\nprocess was significantly enhanced from prior \nyears. See the \u201cCompensation Governance and   \nRisk Management\u201d section of this proxy        \nstatement for a description of the performance\nassessment process. The CMDS Committee        \nreviewed these recommendations in light of the\nperformance assessments with its independent  \ncompensation consultant, Semler Brossy, to    \nassess whether they were reasonable compared  \nwith the market for executive talent and met  \nin executive session to discuss the           \nperformance of our CEO and the other NEOs and \nto determine their compensation. In addition, \nthe CMDS Committee and Board reviewed proposed\nNEO incentive compensation with Mr. Pick, and \nthe CMDS Committee reviewed CEO compensation  \nwith the Board (other than Mr. Pick).         \nCOMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSIDERATIONS Prior to  \ndetermining individual NEO incentive          \ncompensation, the CMDS Committee reviewed and \nconsidered the relationship between Firm      \nperformance, total compensation expense (which\nincludes compensation costs such as base      \nsalaries, allowances, benefits, commissions,  \namortization of prior deferred compensation   \nawards and severance costs), and incentive    \ncompensation as a subset of overall           \ncompensation expense. This exercise furthers  \nthe balancing of the objectives of delivering \nreturns for shareholders, while providing     \nappropriate rewards to motivate superior      \nindividual performance.                       \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT71  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nGLOBAL REGULATORY PRINCIPLES The Firm\u2019s       \ncompensation practices are subject to         \noversight by our regulators in the United     \nStates and internationally. For example, the  \nFirm is subject to the Federal Reserve        \nguidance that is designed to help ensure that \nincentive compensation paid by a banking      \norganization does not encourage imprudent     \nrisk-taking that threatens the organization\u2019s \nsafety and soundness. The Firm is also subject\nto the compensation-related provisions of the \nDodd-Frank Act, as well as the remuneration   \ncode of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority  \nand the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority  \nRulebook, which prescribes the compensation   \nstructure for certain employees who are       \nidentified as material risk-takers, and the   \nEuropean Banking Authority guidelines on sound\nremuneration policies. COMPENSATION CONTROLS  \nTogether with senior management, the CMDS     \nCommittee oversees the Firm\u2019s controls        \nregarding the year-end compensation process,  \nincluding policies and procedures for         \ncompensation plan governance, funding and     \nallocating the incentive compensation pool,   \nand the use of discretion in determining      \nindividual incentive compensation awards;     \nprocesses for identifying \u201crisk-taking\u201d       \nemployees; and processes to administer        \nincentive compensation clawback and           \ncancellation features.

Annual incentive compensation is \nintended to reward NEOs for achievement of the\nFirm\u2019s financial and strategic objectives over\nthe prior year, and individual performance,   \nincluding risk management, and is delivered in\na mix of a cash bonus and deferred incentive  \ncompensation in the form of deferred equity.  \nThe amount of incentive compensation that is  \ndeferred is based on a deferral table, which  \nprovides for a more significant deferral at   \nhigher incentive compensation levels. For     \n2024, the CMDS Committee granted 100% of each \nNEO\u2019s deferred incentive compensation in      \nequity-based RSUs and/or PSUs, aligning       \ncompensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. The\nPSUs, which are deferred equity awards that   \nare subject to future achievement of specified\nfinancial objectives over a three-year period,\nare described in more detail in Section 4.3

                     \n4.3 Performance Stock Unit Program The PSUs   \ngranted on January 17, 2025 (2025 PSUs) tie a \nmeaningful portion of each NEO\u2019s compensation \nto the Firm\u2019s long-term financial performance \nand reinforce the NEO\u2019s accountability for the\nachievement of the Firm\u2019s financial and       \nstrategic objectives by directly linking the  \nultimate realizable award value to prospective\nperformance against core financial measures   \nover a three-year period. GENERAL TERMS The   \n2025 PSUs will vest and convert to shares of  \nthe Firm\u2019s common stock at the end of the     \nthree-year performance period upon the Firm\u2019s \nachievement of predetermined performance      \nobjectives with respect to the Firm\u2019s average \nROTCE and the Firm\u2019s average ROTCE relative to\nthe ROTCE of each member of a peer group, as  \nset forth below, over the period beginning on \nJanuary 1, 2025, and ending on December 31,   \n2027. These performance objectives are        \nconsistent with, and drive, the Firm\u2019s long-  \nterm strategy, reflective in the strategic    \nobjectives in Section 1.3 and the performance \npriorities in Section 3.1. While each         \nparticipant was awarded a target number of    \nperformance stock units, the actual number of \nunits earned could vary from zero, if         \nperformance objectives are not met, to up to  \n1.5 times target, if performance objectives   \nare meaningfully exceeded. No participant will\nreceive any portion of the PSU award if the   \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \nThe 2025 PSUs earn cash dividends that accrue \ninterest at the short-term Treasury rate then \nin effect, compounded monthly, through the    \nscheduled conversion date. The PSU awards     \nremain subject to cancellation upon certain   \nevents until they are converted to shares of  \nFirm common stock. If, after conversion of the\nPSU awards, the CMDS Committee determines that\nthe performance certified by the CMDS         \nCommittee was based on materially inaccurate  \nfinancial statements, then the shares         \ndelivered will be subject to clawback by the  \nFirm. PSU awards are also subject to any      \nclawback policy adopted by the Firm from time \nto time, including to comply with applicable  \nrules and regulations (including the Dodd-    \nFrank Act and the regulations and listing     \nstandards adopted thereunder). The Firm has   \nadopted a clawback policy (the Morgan Stanley \nCompensation Recoupment Policy) to comply with\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations and    \nlisting standards adopted thereunder.         \nPERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES One-half of the target \nPSU award is earned based on the Firm\u2019s       \naverage ROTCE over the three-year performance \nperiod (MS Average ROTCE). The other half of  \nthe target PSU award is earned based on the   \nFirm\u2019s average ROTCE over the three-year      \nperformance period relative to the ROTCE of   \neach member of a peer group (ROTCE Comparison \nGroup) over the same three-year performance   \nperiod (Relative ROTCE). The number of stock  \nunits ultimately earned will be determined by \nmultiplying each half of the target award by a\nmultiplier as follows (for performance between\ntwo thresholds, straight-line interpolation   \napplies):                                     \n                                              \n  MS                     Relative             \n  Average    Multipl\u2026    ROTCE*      Multip\u2026  \n  ROTCE                                       \n  16% or                 75th                 \n  more           1.50    percent\u2026       1.50  \n                         or more              \n  13%            1.00    55th           1.00  \n                         percent\u2026             \n  8%             0.50    25th           0.50  \n                         percent\u2026             \n                         Less                 \n  Less           0.00    than           0.00  \n  than 8%                25th                 \n                         percent\u2026             \n                                              \n                                              \n     The ROTCE Comparison Group is Bank of    \n  *  America, Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche   \n     Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase,     \n     UBS Group and Wells Fargo.               \n                                              \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate  \nmultiplier will be capped at 1.0 if MS Average\nROTCE over the performance period is less than\n9%.                                           \n                                         \n  80MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThe CMDS Committee reviews the structure and  \nterms of the PSU program at least annually.   \nThe CMDS Committee believes that an absolute  \nand relative ROTCE objective is aligned with  \nFirm strategic objectives, given that ROTCE is\na key Firm performance priority and that the  \nsignificant proportion of executive           \ncompensation awarded in the form of equity    \nawards appropriately aligns executives\u2019       \ninterests with those of shareholders and      \nmotivates executives to work to achieve strong\nshareholder returns. In addition, ROTCE is an \nobjective financial measure used as a         \nperformance criterion in performance equity   \nprograms of many of the Firm\u2019s peers. As      \ndescribed in further detail in note 2 to the  \n\u201c2024 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\u201d table, each\nof our NEOs received a PSU award in January   \n2024 (2024 PSUs) on similar terms as described\nabove. AMENDMENT Effective December 16, 2024, \nPSUs granted in 2023 and January 2024 (Amended\nPSUs) were amended to remove each of the below\nspecified adjustments (a) through (d) from the\ndefinition of \u201cMS ROTCE\u201d utilized for purposes\nof calculating the one-half of the Target     \nAward earned based on the Firm\u2019s absolute     \nROTCE in order to align the definition of \u201cMS \nROTCE\u201d utilized for absolute and relative     \nperformance, with both calculations using     \nROTCE as reported in the Firm\u2019s Form 10-K for \neach relevant fiscal year: \u201cMS ROTCE\u201d will be \ncalculated based on the average of the        \nearnings applicable to Morgan Stanley\u2019s common\nshareholders as a percentage of average       \ntangible common equity as reported in the     \nFirm\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K for each \nfiscal year during the Performance Period,    \nadjusted to eliminate the impact of the       \nfollowing items with respect to each such     \nfiscal year: (a) debt valuation adjustments,  \n(b) any individual gain or loss associated    \nwith the sale of any Disposal Group at the    \ntime of, or subsequent to, it being classified\nas Held for Sale, (c) any aggregate gains or  \nlosses associated with legal settlements      \nand/or accruals related to legal settlements  \nrecognized in the fiscal year and relating to \nbusiness activities conducted prior to January\n1, 2011 and (d) any impacts for changes to an \nindividual, or application of a new,          \naccounting rule that are not applied on a full\nretrospective basis in the year of adoption   \nand result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment\n(recorded either as a gain or a loss, or as an\nadjustment to equity) in the applicable fiscal\nyear. The incremental fair value recognized in\n2024 upon the amendment of the Amended PSUs is\nincluded in the \u201cStock Awards\" column of the  \n\u201c2024 Summary Compensation Table.\u201d See notes 4\nand 5 to the \u201c2024 Summary Compensation       \nTable.\u201d PSU PROGRAM PERFORMANCE The CMDS      \nCommittee has consistently set challenging    \nperformance objectives for our PSUs. The      \nvariability over time of the percentage of our\nPSUs that have been earned demonstrates a     \nstrong pay-for-performance link. Since the    \ninception of the program in 2009, the average \nof the payouts of all 13 annual PSU awards up \nto and including the PSUs granted in 2022     \n(2022 PSUs) is 112% of target.                \n                           \n  PSU PROGRAM PERFORMANCE  \n                           \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT81  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nAs described in note 3 to the \u201c2024 Stock     \nVested\u201d table, 2022 PSUs vested at 137% of    \ntarget, based on performance over the three-  \nyear performance period ended December 31,    \n2024. 4.4 Additional Compensation Practices   \nINDEPENDENT ADVICE The CMDS Committee has the \npower to retain and terminate independent     \ncompensation consultants, legal counsel, or   \nfinancial or other advisors as it may deem    \nnecessary to assist it in the performance of  \nits duties and responsibilities. For 2024, the\nCMDS Committee retained an independent        \ncompensation consultant, Semler Brossy, to    \nassist the CMDS Committee in collecting and   \nevaluating external market data regarding     \nexecutive compensation and performance, and to\nadvise the CMDS Committee on developing trends\nand best practices in executive compensation  \nand equity and incentive plan design. In      \nperforming these services, Semler Brossy      \nattended meetings of the CMDS Committee       \nregularly, including portions of the meetings \nwithout management present, and separately    \nwith the CMDS Committee Chair. Semler Brossy  \nwas an independent advisor to the CMDS        \nCommittee in 2024 and did not and does not    \nprovide any other services to the Firm or its \nexecutive officers that could jeopardize their\nindependent status. The Firm has affirmatively\ndetermined that no conflict of interest has   \narisen in connection with the work of Semler  \nBrossy as compensation consultant for the CMDS\nCommittee. The CMDS Committee made            \ncompensation decisions for 2024 in            \nconsultation with Semler Brossy, as discussed \nin Section 1.2 \u201cFramework for CEO Compensation\nDecision,\u201d and Section 3.1 \u201cFactors Considered\nin Compensation Decisions\u2014Input and           \nRecommendations From the CEO, Independent     \nDirectors, and Independent Consultant.\u201d STOCK \nOWNERSHIP COMMITMENT NEOs are subject to a    \nrobust Equity Ownership Commitment, which is  \ndiscussed in detail in this proxy statement   \nunder \u201cOwnership of Our Stock\u2014Executive Equity\nOwnership Commitment.\u201d NO HEDGING OR PLEDGING \nFirm policy prohibits NEOs from pledging,     \nselling short, engaging in hedging strategies,\nor trading derivatives involving Morgan       \nStanley securities. See also \u201cOwnership of Our\nStock\u2014Prohibition Against Pledging and        \nHedging.\u201d CLAWBACK POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The\nFirm has adopted a clawback policy (the Morgan\nStanley Compensation Recoupment Policy) to    \ncomply with the Dodd-Frank Act and the        \nregulations and listing standards adopted     \nthereunder. In addition, deferred incentive   \ncompensation awards are subject to robust     \ncancellation and clawback provisions described\nin the table below. The clawback policy is    \nfiled as Exhibit 97 to the 2024 Form 10-K.    \nThroughout the year, employee conduct matters \nare reviewed to determine whether they present\nsituations that could require clawback or     \ncancellation of previously awarded            \ncompensation, as well as downward adjustments \nto current-year compensation. Clawbacks of    \npreviously awarded compensation are reviewed  \nwith the Employee Discipline Oversight        \nCommittee (a committee of senior management   \ncurrently composed of the Chief Financial     \nOfficer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Risk      \nOfficer, Chief Audit Officer, Co-Chief Human  \nResources Officers, and the Head of Non-      \nFinancial Risk) (EDOC) and reported to the    \nCMDS Committee.                               \n                                         \n  82MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nIn addition, the Global Incentive Compensation\nDiscretion Policy adopted by the CMDS         \nCommittee sets forth standards for managers on\nthe use of discretion when making annual      \ncompensation decisions and considerations for \nassessing risk management and outcomes.       \nFurther, the Firm\u2019s control functions         \nparticipate in a review of employee conduct   \nwith respect to risk management matters and   \nare asked to identify inappropriate behavior  \nthat may not be captured through other Firm   \nprocesses. The results of the reviews are     \nreflected in performance feedback and         \nconsidered in promotion and compensation      \ndecisions. The Firm\u2019s Control Function        \nAssessment Committee (CFAC), a management     \ncommittee reporting to the CMDS Committee, has\nresponsibility for oversight of the Firm\u2019s    \nprocess for collecting input, information and \nmetrics regarding the risk management         \nperformance of the Operating Committee members\nand other employees, and reviewing such       \ninformation to

are not contractually entitled to any    \ngolden parachute excise tax protection upon a \nchange in control of Morgan Stanley and are   \nnot entitled to severance pay upon termination\nof employment in excess of broad-based        \nbenefits. NO EXECUTIVE PENSIONS Firm-provided \nretirement benefits in the United States      \ninclude a tax-qualified 401(k) plan (401(k)   \nPlan) and a frozen tax-qualified pension plan \n(the Employees Retirement Plan (ERP)). No NEO \nis awarded with credited service in excess of \nhis or her actual service under the ERP.      \nPension and retirement benefits provided to   \nNEOs are discussed in further detail under    \n\u201c2024 Pension Benefits.\u201d HEALTH AND INSURANCE \nBENEFITS All NEOs are eligible to participate \nin Firm-sponsored health and insurance benefit\nprograms available in the relevant            \njurisdiction to similarly situated employees. \nIn the United States, more highly compensated \nemployees pay more to participate in the      \nFirm\u2019s medical plan. NEOs are also eligible to\nparticipate in Morgan Stanley\u2019s Executive     \nHealth Program, under which each NEO is       \neligible to receive Firm-funded access to a   \nprivate primary care physician offering on-   \ncall services and an annual executive         \nhealthcare assessment. Upon retirement, NEOs  \nare eligible for Firm-paid retiree health     \ncoverage for themselves and eligible          \ndependents. NO EXCESSIVE PERQUISITES The Firm \nprovides personal benefits to certain of the  \nNEOs for competitive, health, and productivity\nreasons. The Firm\u2019s Board-approved policy     \nauthorizes the CEO to use the Firm\u2019s aircraft.\nAs of October 27, 2021, Mr. Pick entered into \na time-share agreement with the Firm          \npermitting him to reimburse the Firm for the  \nincremental cost of his personal use of the   \nFirm\u2019s aircraft. In 2024, the CEO reimbursed  \nthe Firm for the incremental cost of his      \npersonal use of the Firm\u2019s aircraft within    \npermitted regulatory maximums, and other NEOs \nare generally not authorized to use the Firm\u2019s\naircraft for personal reasons unless they     \nreceive prior permission from both the CEO and\nthe Chief Legal Officer and reimburse the Firm\nfor the incremental cost of their personal use\nof the Firm\u2019s aircraft in an amount not to    \nexceed permitted regulatory maximums. Personal\nbenefits provided to NEOs are discussed in    \nfurther detail under \u201c2024 Summary            \nCompensation Table.\u201d SHARE USAGE Morgan       \nStanley pays a significant portion of         \nincentive compensation as deferred equity     \nawards, which aligns the interests of the     \nFirm\u2019s employees with those of its            \nshareholders. The Firm strives to maximize    \nemployee and shareholder alignment through the\nuse of deferred equity awards, while          \nminimizing dilution. The Firm\u2019s share         \nrepurchase program offsets the dilutive impact\nof these additional shares. TIMING OF EQUITY  \nGRANTS Morgan Stanley does not currently grant\nstock options or similar awards, and none of  \nour NEOs held any unexercised stock options on\nDecember 31, 2024. We historically do not time\nlong-term incentive awards in coordination    \nwith the release of MNPI and have never had a \npractice of doing so. We have never timed and \ndo not plan to time the release of MNPI for   \nthe purpose of affecting the value of         \nexecutive compensation. 2025-2026 SENIOR      \nADVISOR ARRANGEMENT Mr. Gorman, who served as \nExecutive Chairman through December 31, 2024, \nwas named Chairman Emeritus, a non-director   \nhonorary designation, effective January 1,    \n2025.

These present values    \n       decreased during 2024 due to an        \n       increase in discount rates, partially  \n       offset by other factors. The present   \n       values at December\u00a031, 2024 use 91%    \n       of the Pri-2012 white collar           \n       mortality tables (amounts-weighted),   \n       with no mortality before retirement.   \n  (6)  These tables are projected             \n       generationally from 2012, using the    \n       standard version of Scale MP-2021.     \n       The present values reflect discount    \n       rates of 5.62% for the ERP.

PRE-  \nTAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM (PTIP) Under PTIP,      \nparticipants were permitted to defer a portion\nof their cash bonus or commissions for one or \nmore fiscal years. The plan has been closed to\nnew contributions since 2003. Earnings on PTIP\ncontributions are based on the performance of \nnotional investments available under the plan \nand selected by the                           \n                                         \n  94MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nparticipants. Participants could generally    \nelect the commencement date for distributions \nof their contributions and earnings and the   \nnumber of annual installments over which to   \nreceive distributions (generally, five, 10, 15\nor 20 years). Subject to earlier distribution \non death or termination of employment due to  \ndisability, no distributions may begin prior  \nto the attainment of age 55 and prior to      \ntermination of employment. RESTRICTED STOCK   \nUNITS (RSUs) RSUs are granted under the Morgan\nStanley Equity Incentive Compensation Plan or \nanother Firm equity plan as determined by the \nCMDS Committee. Each RSU constitutes a        \ncontingent and unsecured promise of the Firm  \nto pay the holder one share of Firm common    \nstock on the conversion date of the RSU. The  \nRSUs included in this table are considered    \nvested; however, the RSUs are subject to      \ncancellation and clawback if a cancellation or\nclawback event occurs at any time prior to the\nscheduled conversion date. The cancellation   \nand clawback events applicable to RSUs held by\nour NEOs are described in the CD&A and in     \n\u201cPotential Payments upon Termination or Change\nin Control.\u201d Potential Payments upon          \nTermination or Change in Control This section \ndescribes and quantifies the benefits and     \ncompensation to which each NEO would have been\nentitled under our existing plans and         \narrangements if the NEO\u2019s employment had      \nterminated or if the Firm had undergone a     \nchange in control, in each case, on December  \n31, 2024. For Mr. Gorman, this section        \ndescribes and quantifies the compensation and \nbenefits to which he was entitled in          \nconnection with his retirement from the Firm  \non December 31, 2024. GENERAL POLICIES No     \nSpecial Severance Payments Our NEOs would be  \nentitled to a cash severance payment under the\nbroad-based Morgan Stanley Severance Pay Plan \n(Severance Plan) in connection with an        \ninvoluntary termination of employment other   \nthan for cause, subject to the NEO executing a\nrelease agreement in a form satisfactory to   \nthe Firm, on the same basis as all other      \nemployees. The NEOs are not entitled to any   \nadditional or enhanced cash severance payments\nupon any termination of employment under the  \nSeverance Plan or otherwise, or to excise tax \nprotection upon a change in control of the    \nFirm. No Enhanced Termination Payments or     \nBenefits NEOs are entitled to receive post-   \ntermination benefits that are generally       \navailable to all salaried employees, such as  \ndeath, disability and post-retirement welfare \nbenefits, and are eligible for Firm-paid      \nretiree medical coverage under the Morgan     \nStanley Retiree Medical Plan for themselves   \nand eligible dependents following any         \ntermination of employment with three years of \nservice. Following termination of employment, \nthe NEOs are also entitled to amounts, to the \nextent vested, due under the terms of our     \npension arrangements, as described under \u201c2024\nPension Benefits,\u201d and our nonqualified       \ndeferred compensation plans, as described     \nunder \u201c2024 Nonqualified Deferred             \nCompensation.\u201d Our NEOs are not entitled to   \nspecial or enhanced termination benefits under\nour pension and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation plans as compared to other       \nemployees. Cancellation and Clawback of       \nDeferred Compensation and Incentive-Based     \nCompensation Even if an NEO is considered     \nvested in a deferred incentive compensation   \naward, the award may be subject to            \ncancellation through the distribution date in \nthe event the NEO engages in a cancellation   \nevent or if a clawback event occurs. In       \ngeneral, a cancellation event includes:       \nengaging in competitive activity during a     \nspecified period following a voluntary        \ntermination of employment; engaging in conduct\nconstituting cause (i.e., a breach of the     \nNEO\u2019s obligation to the Firm, including a     \nfailure to comply with internal policies, or  \ncompliance, ethics or risk management         \nstandards and failure or refusal to perform   \nduties satisfactorily, including supervisory  \nand management duties); improper disclosure of\nthe Firm\u2019s proprietary information;           \nsolicitation of Firm employees, clients or    \ncustomers during, and within a specified      \nperiod following termination                  \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT95  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nof, employment; the making of unauthorized    \ndisclosures or disparaging or defamatory      \ncomments about the Firm; resignation from     \nemployment without providing the Firm proper  \nadvance notice; or the failure to cooperate   \nwith or assist the Firm in connection with    \ninvestigations, regulatory matters, lawsuits  \nor arbitrations following termination of      \nemployment. Clawback of deferred compensation \nawards by the Firm can be triggered through   \nthe applicable scheduled distribution date if \nthe NEO had significant responsibility for a  \nmaterial adverse outcome for the Firm or any  \nof its businesses or functions, even absent   \nmisconduct, or if the NEO\u2019s act or omission   \n(including with respect to direct supervisory \nresponsibilities) causes a restatement of the \nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial results,        \nviolates the Firm\u2019s global risk management    \nprinciples, policies and standards, or causes \na loss of revenue associated with a position  \nfor which the NEO was paid, and the NEO       \noperated outside of internal control policies.\nFurther, shares resulting from the conversion \nof PSUs are subject to clawback by the Firm in\nthe event the Firm\u2019s achievement of the       \nspecified goals was based on materially       \ninaccurate financial statements or other      \nperformance metric criteria. In addition, PSUs\nare subject to repayment under the Morgan     \nStanley Compensation Recoupment Policy if     \nexcess amounts are delivered based on an      \naccounting restatement (without regard to     \nfault or misconduct) within the three fiscal  \nyears preceding the date the restatement was  \nrequired. Notice and Non-Solicitation         \nAgreements In addition to the cancellation and\nclawback events described above, each NEO is  \nparty to a Notice and Non-Solicitation        \nAgreement that provides for injunctive relief \nand cancellation of deferred compensation     \nawards if the NEO does not provide 180 days\u2019  \nadvance notice prior to a resignation or if   \nthe NEO improperly solicits the Firm\u2019s        \nemployees, clients or customers at any time   \nduring employment or the 180 days following   \ntermination of employment.                    \n                                         \n  96MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nTERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT / CHANGE IN CONTROL \nThe table below sets forth with respect to    \neach NEO, as of December 31, 2024, the value  \nof outstanding unvested deferred compensation \nawards and cash severance entitlements, and   \nthe present value of coverage under the Morgan\nStanley Retiree Medical Plan.

Governmental service     \n       termination treatment is conditioned   \n       upon satisfactory proof of a conflict  \n       of interest that necessitates          \n       divestiture of the awards and          \n       executing an agreement to repay        \n       amounts vested in connection with      \n       such termination if the NEO engages    \n       in any cancellation event.             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Other than with respect to the         \n       Staking Award PSUs, which are          \n       described in note 5 below, our NEOs    \n       are retirement-eligible for purposes   \n       of their outstanding PSUs; however,    \n       such awards are not considered vested  \n       for purposes of this proxy statement   \n       until the end of the performance       \n       period because these awards only       \n       deliver value if the Firm achieves     \n       objective performance goals over such  \n       performance period. Amounts shown in   \n       the table reflect performance through  \n       December\u00a031, 2024 (the quarter ending  \n       simultaneously with the effective      \n       date of the termination), which, with  \n       the exception of a termination in      \n       connection with a change in control,   \n       is a substitute for performance        \n  (2)  through the three-year performance     \n       period, which would not be known       \n       until the end of such period.

Because SEC rules\nfor identifying the median compensated        \nemployee for purposes of this disclosure allow\ncompanies to adopt various methodologies and  \nutilize various assumptions, the ratio        \nreported by other companies may not be        \ncomparable to the ratio reported by the Firm. \nFor 2024, our last completed fiscal year, the \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nemployees of the Firm (other than the CEO) was\n$138,509 and the annual total compensation of \nour CEO, as reported in the \u201c2024 Summary     \nCompensation Table,\u201d was $24,881,032. Based on\nthis information, for 2024, the ratio of the  \nannual total compensation of the CEO to the   \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nother employees of the Firm was 180 to 1. To  \nidentify the median of the annual total       \ncompensation of all employees of the Firm, we \ntook the following steps:                     \n                                              \n      The pay ratio rule gives companies the  \n      ability to make the median employee     \n      determination only once every three     \n  1.  years, and we did not make a new        \n      median employee determination for       \n      2024. The median employee               \n      determination for 2023 is described     \n      below.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     We measured the employee population of   \n     the Firm as of December\u00a031, 2023, and    \n     included all employees of Morgan         \n     Stanley and its consolidated             \n     subsidiaries globally. We did not        \n     include independent contractors and      \n     leased employees. Although our employee  \n     population varies slightly from the      \n     employee population in our December\u00a031,  \n     2023 determination, there have not been  \n     any changes that we reasonably believe   \n     would significantly impact our pay       \n  \u2022  ratio disclosure.                        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     We selected annual total reward awarded  \n     in respect of 2023 as the consistently   \n     applied compensation measure used to     \n     identify the employee with the median    \n     of the annual total compensation of all  \n     employees (the median employee). Annual  \n     total reward consists of fixed           \n     compensation (e.g., base salary and      \n     allowances) and annual incentive         \n  \u2022  compensation delivered in cash or        \n     equity and other variable compensation   \n     analogous to annual incentive            \n     compensation (e.g., commissions). We     \n     annualized the compensation of all       \n     permanent employees who were employed    \n     for less than the full fiscal year. We   \n     did not make any cost-of-living          \n     adjustments in identifying the median    \n     employee. Our                            \n                                              \n                                         \n  98MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nmedian employee for 2023 served in a similar  \nrole in 2024 and had his or her compensation  \nadjusted based on his or her performance in   \nthat role. We determined that changes in our  \nmedian employee\u2019s compensation for 2024 did   \nnot result in a significant change to our pay \nratio disclosure and, therefore, that it was  \nreasonable to utilize our median employee for \nour pay ratio disclosure for 2024.            \n                                              \n      Once we identified that our median      \n      employee selected for 2023 was still    \n      reasonable for 2024 disclosure, we      \n  2.  calculated the median employee\u2019s        \n      annual total compensation for 2024 in   \n      accordance with the Summary             \n      Compensation Table requirements.        \n                                              \nPay versus Performance Pursuant to SEC rules, \nthe \u201cPay versus Performance\u201d disclosure is    \nrequired to include the following: (1) tabular\ncompensation and performance disclosure for   \nthe years 2020 through 2024 (the PvP Table),  \n(2) an unranked list of three to seven        \nperformance measures that the Firm considers  \nto be its most important measures used to     \nalign compensation actually paid to the NEOs  \nfor 2024 to Firm performance (the PvP         \nMeasures), and (3) a clear description of the \nrelationship between the \u201cCompensation        \nActually Paid\u201d in the PvP Table and each of   \nthe company-selected performance measures in  \nthe PvP Table, the Firm\u2019s Net Income and the  \nFirm\u2019s TSR, and between the Firm\u2019s TSR and the\nPeer Group TSR, in each case over 2020-2024   \n(the PvP Relationship Disclosure). A detailed \ndiscussion of the CMDS Committee\u2019s decisions  \nregarding the compensation awarded to the NEOs\nfor 2024 performance can be found in the CD&A.\nPvP TABLE Pursuant to SEC rules, the PvP Table\nis required to include for each year          \n\u201cCompensation Actually Paid\u201d (CAP) to the CEO \nand the average CAP to the non-CEO NEOs. CAP  \nis an SEC defined term that represents a      \ncalculation of compensation that differs from \ncompensation paid during the year, the Summary\nCompensation Table (SCT) calculation of       \ncompensation (as detailed in note 2 of this   \nPvP Table), and the way in which the CMDS     \nCommittee views annual compensation decisions \n(as discussed in Section 4.1 of the CD&A). For\nexample, the CAP calculation for a given year \nincludes the change in fair value of multiple \nyears of equity grants that are outstanding   \nand unvested during the year, or which vested \nduring the year, whereas the SCT calculation  \nincludes only the fair value of equity awards \ngranted during the year. The CAP calculation  \nalso includes the value of dividend           \nequivalents accumulated on unvested equity    \nawards, whereas the SCT calculation does not. \nThese differences result in a CAP calculation \nthat is significantly impacted by changes in  \nstock price and other projected performance   \nresults and may be significantly higher or    \nlower than the corresponding SCT calculation. \nIt is also important to note that outstanding \nequity awards may be represented in more than \none year of the table, as demonstrated in the \nsupplemental table to footnote 1 to the PvP   \nTable. Equity grants (RSU and PSUs) constitute\na meaningful portion of compensation for the  \nCEO and other NEOs. The value of equity grants\nwill not be realized before the scheduled     \npayment date (generally three years from      \ngrant) and the ultimate value of such awards  \nis subject to changes in stock price. PSUs are\nfurther subject to the results of             \npredetermined three-year performance          \nobjectives. PSUs are earned based on          \nperformance against predetermined Firm goals. \nWhile each participant was awarded a target   \nnumber of PSUs, the actual number of PSUs     \nearned could vary from zero up to 1.5 times   \ntarget, if performance objectives are         \nmeaningfully exceeded, and no participant will\nreceive any portion of the PSUs if the        \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \n(For a summary of historical PSU performance, \nsee Section 4.3 of the CD&A.) In addition,    \nequity awards are subject to cancellation upon\ncertain events before they convert to shares  \nof Morgan Stanley common stock. The CEO and   \nother NEOs are also subject to an Equity      \nOwnership Commitment and are not able to sell,\ntransfer or otherwise dispose of all of the   \nshares of Firm common stock received upon     \nconversion of equity awards (see \u201cOwnership of\nOur Stock\u2013Executive Equity Ownership          \nCommitment\u201d).                                 \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT99  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n                                              \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                             \u2026                \n                \u2026    \u2026                        \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026            \u2026           \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026           \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026            \u2026           \n      \u2026         \u2026    \u2026                        \n                \u2026                             \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026       \u2026    \u2026      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The CEO reflected in columns (a) and   \n  (1)  (b) is the following individual for    \n       each of the years shown:               \n                                              \n                                  \n  2024           Edward Pick      \n  2023 - 2020    James P.

The portions of PSUs that   \nare earned based on the Firm\u2019s TSR relative to\nthe TSR of the S&P Financials Sector Index (a \nmarket-based condition) are valued using a    \nMonte Carlo valuation model at each           \nmeasurement date.

At December   \n31, 2024, the portion of PSUs earned based on \nthe Firm\u2019s TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P \nFinancials Sectors Index are considered vested\nand therefore valued using actual TSR.

The Firm\u2019s     \nstrategic acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton   \nVance, in 2020 and 2021 respectively, as well \nas the achievement of other long-term         \nstrategic objectives led by the CEO and the   \nFirm\u2019s Operating Committee, of which the NEOs \nare a part, were significant contributors to  \nthe Firm\u2019s stock price outperformance. Year-  \nover-year changes to the CAP to CEO and the   \nAverage CAP to Non-CEO NEOs between 2020 and  \n2021, 2021 and 2022, excluding the Staking    \nAwards between 2022 and 2023, and 2023 and    \n2024, generally correlate to changes in the   \nFirm\u2019s cumulative TSR (as calculated pursuant \nto SEC rules for the PvP table), Net Income   \nand ROTCE for the same periods. The Firm      \ndelivered strong Net Income and ROTCE, and    \nsignificant stock appreciation and returns to \nshareholders, over these periods. The table   \nbelow shows that CEO and Average Non-CEO NEO  \ncompensation (as reported in SCT) changes were\nin line with changes in the Firm\u2019s Net Income \nand ROTCE, while changes in the value of the  \nCAP to CEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs\nwere impacted by the following factors:       \ndividends, change in pension value, and       \nchanges in fair value of equity awards (e.g., \ndue to performance conditions of performance- \nbased equity and share price).                \n                                              \n                              \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n                              \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    9        \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n                              \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n      \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026        \u2026        \u2026      \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT103  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nPvP RELATIONSHIP DISCLOSURE                   \n                                              \n       \u2026                                      \n       \u2026                                      \n       \u2026                                      \n                                  \u2026        \u2026  \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                                  \u2026        \u2026  \n                                              \n                9        9        \u2026        \u2026  \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                3        3        \u2026        \u2026  \n                                              \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                1        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                              \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                              \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                           \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  (1)  Value of initial fixed $100            \n       investment.                            \n                                              \n                                \n  (2)  As reported in the SCT.  \n                                \n                                              \n       For 2021, also includes multiple RSU   \n  (3)  awards for one NEO that vested in      \n       2021 due to achieving FCR              \n       eligibility.                           \n                                              \nThe correlation between changes in the CAP to \nCEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs and   \nchanges in the Firm\u2019s cumulative TSR and ROTCE\nfor the periods shown in the table is due     \nprimarily to the Firm\u2019s use of equity         \nincentives that are directly tied to stock    \nprice and, in particular, PSUs that are also  \ndirectly tied to Firm financial performance   \nand constitute a significant portion of       \nincentive compensation for the CEO and non-CEO\nNEOs. Because Staking Awards are equity-based \n(60% PSUs and 40% RSUs), they will impact both\nthe CAP to CEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO \nNEOs for each year of the three-year vesting  \nperiod (2024-2026) and their value will       \nfluctuate with Firm stock price and ROTCE     \nperformance. Because the PSUs are equity-     \nbased, increases in Firm stock price result in\nincreases in TSR and increases in CAP values  \nand decreases in Firm stock price result in   \ndecreases in TSR and decreases in CAP values. \nUnlike PSUs, RSUs (with the exception of the  \nStaking Award RSUs, which do not contain a    \nprovision for vesting upon FCR eligibility) do\nnot significantly influence the correlations  \nshown in the above table because, pursuant to \nSEC rules, the CAP calculations for the fair  \nvalue of unvested RSU awards are generally    \nfixed at the grant date fair value of the     \nawards at the beginning of each year due to   \nFCR eligibility under the award terms and     \ndeemed vested at grant. Changes in fair value \nfor the Staking Award RSUs due to fluctuations\nin the share price will,                      \n                                          \n  104MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nhowever, be reflected in the CAP amounts. The \nFirm\u2019s ROTCE is a performance priority that is\nused as a factor in determining incentive     \ncompensation for the CEO and Non-CEO NEOs. The\nFirm does not use Net Income to determine     \ncompensation levels or PSU payouts. Commitment\nto Equitable Compensation Practices Morgan    \nStanley has robust compensation practices that\nhelp ensure that compensation and reward      \ndecisions are made fairly and consistently and\nare based on an individual\u2019s role, performance\nand experience. The Firm reviews compensation \ndecisions for employees on an ongoing basis,  \nincluding at the point of hire as well as     \nduring our annual compensation process, to    \nhelp ensure that individual compensation      \ndecisions are in line with this philosophy. We\nbelieve a workforce that represents the       \nsocieties in which we live and work and our   \ndiverse global client base is important to the\nFirm\u2019s continued success and ability to serve \nour clients, and consistent with that, we are \ncommitted to continually assessing our rewards\nstructure and decisions to help ensure equity \nin pay for all employees.                     \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT105  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOwnership of Our Stock Executive Equity       \nOwnership Commitment Members of the Firm\u2019s    \nOperating Committee and executive officers are\nsubject to an Equity Ownership Commitment. The\nEquity Ownership Commitment requires each of  \nour CEO, CFO, and Co-Presidents (collectively,\nCovered Officers) to achieve ownership of a   \nnumber of shares of common stock and equity   \nawards with a value equal to a specified      \nmultiple of his or her base salary within five\nyears. Our CEO is required to achieve         \nownership of shares of common stock and equity\nawards with a value equal to 10 times his base\nsalary and each other Covered Officer is      \nrequired to achieve ownership of shares of    \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to six times his or her base salary. In \naddition, Operating Committee members         \n(including all executive officers) are        \nrequired to retain common stock and equity    \nawards equal to a percentage of common stock  \nreceived from equity awards (less allowances  \nfor the payment of any option exercise price  \nand taxes) granted to them for service on the \nOperating Committee (Equity Award Shares, and \nsuch service, Covered Service) as follows:    \n                                              \n     Our CEO is required to retain 75% of     \n     Equity Award Shares acquired pursuant    \n     to equity awards granted in respect of   \n     any performance year prior to and        \n  \u2022  including the fifth year of Covered      \n     Service as CEO and 50% of Equity Award   \n     Shares acquired pursuant to equity       \n     awards granted in respect of any         \n     performance year following the fifth     \n     year of Covered Service as CEO.          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each of our other Operating Committee    \n     members and executive officers is        \n     required to retain 50% of Equity Award   \n     Shares acquired from equity awards       \n     granted in respect of any performance    \n     year prior to and including the fifth    \n     year of Covered Service and 33% of       \n  \u2022  Equity Award Shares acquired pursuant    \n     to equity awards granted in respect of   \n     any performance year following the       \n     fifth year of Covered Service; provided  \n     that Operating Committee members who     \n     are Covered Officers must retain 75% of  \n     all Equity Award Shares until the        \n     applicable ownership requirement is      \n     met.                                     \n                                              \nThis commitment ties a portion of our         \nOperating Committee members\u2019 net worth to the \nFirm\u2019s stock price and provides a continuing  \nincentive for them to work toward superior    \nlong-term stock price performance. Exceptions \nto the Equity Ownership Commitment are subject\nto the approval of the CMDS Committee. None of\nour executive officers currently have         \nprearranged trading plans under SEC Rule      \n10b5-1. Shares counted for purposes of the    \nEquity Ownership Commitment include shares    \nowned (including shares held in trust) by the \nexecutive or the executive\u2019s spouse or        \ndependent children, shares (or share          \nequivalents) held in the Firm\u2019s 401(k) Plan   \nand net shares granted with respect to RSUs   \n(including PSUs) after assumed tax            \nwithholding. Unearned PSUs are not counted for\npurposes of the stock ownership requirement.  \nEach Operating Committee member is in         \ncompliance with the requirements of the Equity\nOwnership Commitment. Director Equity         \nOwnership Requirement Our Corporate Governance\nPolicies require each independent director to \nretain ownership of a number of shares of     \nMorgan Stanley common stock and equity awards \nwith a value equal to five times the annual   \ncash Board retainer, and to retain 100% of his\nor her Morgan Stanley stock unit awards (on an\nafter-tax basis) until such ownership         \nrequirement is met. In addition, as discussed \nunder \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d our independent\ndirectors generally receive an equity award   \nupon initial election to the Board and receive\nan annual equity award thereafter with a grant\ndate fair value of $275,000 (prorated in the  \ncase of the initial award) as part of their   \ndirector compensation. Fifty percent of each  \nequity award granted to our independent       \ndirectors does not become payable until the   \ndirector retires from the Board (and may be   \ndeferred beyond retirement at the director\u2019s  \nelection). We believe that these equity       \nownership opportunities and requirements      \nenhance the alignment of independent          \ndirectors\u2019 interests with the long-term       \ninterests of our shareholders.                \n                                          \n  106MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Ownership of Our Stock  \n                          \nInsider Trading Policy The Firm\u2019s Global      \nPolicy for Transactions in Morgan Stanley     \nSecurities (Policy for Transactions in Firm   \nSecurities) sets forth the general rules that \nour directors and employees and the Firm must \nfollow with respect to transactions in our    \nsecurities, and we believe is reasonably      \ndesigned to promote compliance with insider   \ntrading laws, rules and regulations.

The EICP was originally approved\nby shareholders on April 10, 2007, and was    \nlast amended in 2021, with approval of 95.6%  \nof votes cast, to increase the number of      \nshares of common stock available for grant by \n60 million shares. The proposed 50 million    \nadditional shares, which represents           \napproximately 3.1% of the common shares of the\nFirm outstanding as of January 31, 2025, is   \nexpected to allow us to make grants under the \nEICP for approximately three years. Why       \nShareholders Should Approve the Proposal      \nShareholder-Aligned Plan Practices and        \nFeatures Morgan Stanley delivers a significant\nportion of incentive compensation for eligible\nemployees in deferred equity awards (RSUs)    \nthat are impacted by future stock price       \nperformance over a multi-year period and, for \nsenior executives, performance-vested stock   \nunits that only deliver value if the Firm     \nmeets specific performance targets after three\nyears (PSU awards). We believe this approach  \nto executive compensation aligns the interests\nof the Firm\u2019s employees with those of its     \nshareholders and is consistent with executive \nmotivation, best practices, and regulatory    \nprinciples. The Board believes that the EICP  \namendments are in the best interest of        \nshareholders and supports this proposal for   \nthe following reasons:                        \n                                              \n     Broad use of equity-based awards is a    \n     fundamental part of how we align         \n     compensation with our shareholders\u2019      \n     interests.In January 2025,               \n     approximately 13.3\u00a0million shares        \n     underlying equity awards were granted    \n  \u2022  to 18,300 employees as part of the 2024  \n     year-end compensation process, and       \n     583,666 shares (representing the target  \n     number of PSUs) were granted as PSU      \n     awards. After these grants, as of March  \n     31, 2025, approximately 50 million       \n     shares were available for future equity  \n     awards under the EICP.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm strives to maximize employee    \n     and shareholder alignment through the    \n     use of deferred equity awards, while     \n     minimizing dilution.The Firm has         \n     evaluated whether to return to           \n     shareholders to request approval of      \n     additional shares at the 2025 annual     \n  \u2022  meeting of shareholders and has          \n     determined to request an additional 50\u00a0  \n     million shares, which we expect would    \n     allow us to make grants under the EICP   \n     for approximately three years.

Summary of the EICP as  \nProposed to be Amended and Restated A copy of \nthe EICP as proposed to be amended is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and the    \nfollowing summary is qualified in its entirety\nby reference thereto. Other than the          \namendments to increase the number of shares   \navailable under the EICP and extend the term  \nof the EICP by three years, for which we are  \nseeking approval under this Item 4, the EICP  \nterms remain unchanged. The capitalized terms \nnot otherwise defined in this summary shall   \nhave the meaning assigned to them in the EICP.\nPurposes and Eligibility The primary purposes \nof the EICP are to attract, retain and        \nmotivate employees, to compensate them for    \ntheir contributions to our growth and profits \nand to encourage them to own shares of our    \ncommon stock to align their interests with    \nthose of shareholders. The EICP authorizes the\nissuance of awards (Awards) to all officers,  \nother employees (including newly hired        \nemployees) and consultants of the Firm, non-  \nemployee directors of our subsidiaries, and   \nemployees and consultants of joint ventures,  \npartnerships or similar business organizations\nin which we or one of our subsidiaries has an \nequity or similar interest (Eligible          \nIndividuals). As of March 2025, there were    \napproximately 80,000 Eligible Individuals. The\nbasis for participation in the EICP is the    \nCMDS\u2019s determination, in its sole discretion, \nthat an award to an eligible participant will \nfurther the EICP\u2019s purposes of attracting,    \nretaining and motivating employees, to        \ncompensate them for their contributions to our\ngrowth and profits and to encourage them to   \nown shares of our common stock to align their \ninterests with those of shareholders. In      \nexercising its discretion, the CMDS will      \nconsider the recommendations of management and\nthe purposes of the EICP. Administration The  \nCMDS Committee will administer the EICP,      \nselect the Eligible Individuals who receive   \nAwards (Participants) and determine the form  \nand terms of the Awards, including any        \nvesting, exercisability, payment or other     \nrestrictions. Subject to certain limitations, \nthe CMDS Committee may delegate some or all of\nits authority to one or more administrators   \n(e.g., one or more CMDS Committee members or  \none or more of our officers). Shares Available\nUnder the EICP Since initial shareholder      \napproval of the EICP in 2007, the total number\nof shares of common stock that may be         \ndelivered pursuant to Awards will be 483      \nmillion (which takes into account the proposed\n50 million share increase), of which          \napproximately 383.7 million were already      \ngranted as of January 31, 2025, subject to    \nadjustment pursuant to the EICP\u2019s share       \ncounting rules as described below and to      \nreflect certain transactions. Shares delivered\nunder the EICP may be either treasury shares  \nor newly issued shares. In addition to the    \noverall limit, the EICP limits the number of  \nshares of common stock that may be subject to \nstock option and stock appreciation right     \n(SAR) awards in any single year. Share        \nCounting Rules When the CMDS Committee grants \nan Award, the full number of shares subject to\nthe Award is charged against the number of    \nshares that remain available for delivery     \npursuant to Awards. After grant, the number of\nshares subject to any portion of an Award that\nis canceled or that expires without having    \nbeen settled in shares, or that is settled    \nthrough the delivery of consideration other   \nthan shares, will be available for new Awards.\nIf shares are tendered or withheld to pay the \nexercise price of an Award or to satisfy a tax\n                                          \n  112MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \nwithholding obligation, those tendered or     \nwithheld shares will be available for new     \nAwards.

At the discretion of     \n     the CMDS Committee, SARs may be payable  \n     in common stock, cash or a combination   \n     thereof.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Exercise Price.The exercise price of     \n     stock options and SARs awarded under     \n     the EICP may not be less than 100% of    \n     the fair market value of one share of    \n     common stock on the award date;          \n     however, the exercise price per share    \n  \u2022  of a stock option or SAR that is         \n     granted in substitution for an award     \n     previously granted by an entity          \n     acquired by the Firm or with which the   \n     Firm combines may be less than the fair  \n     market value per share on the award      \n     date if such substitution complies with  \n     applicable laws and regulations.         \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT113  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \n                                              \n     Prohibition on Repricing of Stock        \n     Options and SARs.The CMDS Committee may  \n     not \u201creprice\u201d any stock option or SAR    \n     or make any other amendment to a stock   \n     option or SAR that has the effect of     \n     reducing its exercise price or cancel a  \n  \u2022  stock option or SAR in exchange for      \n     cash or another Award, unless the        \n     repricing occurs in connection with a    \n     merger, acquisition, spin-off, or other  \n     similar corporate transaction.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME \nTAX CONSEQUENCES The following is a general   \nsummary as of the date of this proxy statement\nof the U.S. federal income tax consequences   \nassociated with the EICP. The federal tax laws\nare complex and subject to change and the tax \nconsequences for any Participant will depend  \non his or her individual circumstances.       \n                                              \n     Stock Units.A Participant who receives   \n     stock units will be taxed at ordinary    \n     income tax rates on the then fair        \n     market value of the shares of common     \n     stock distributed at the time of         \n     settlement of the stock units and a      \n     corresponding deduction will be          \n  \u2022  allowable to the Firm at that time       \n     (subject to Section 162(m) of the        \n     Internal Revenue Code). The              \n     Participant\u2019s tax basis in the shares    \n     will equal the amount taxed as ordinary  \n     income, and on subsequent disposition    \n     the Participant will realize long-term   \n     or short-term capital gain or\u00a0loss.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Restricted Stock.A Participant who is    \n     awarded restricted stock will not be     \n     taxed at the time an Award is granted    \n     unless the Participant makes the         \n     special election with the Internal       \n     Revenue Service pursuant to Section      \n     83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code as    \n     discussed below. Upon lapse of the risk  \n     of forfeiture or restrictions on         \n     transferability applicable to the        \n     shares comprising the Award, the         \n     Participant will be taxed at ordinary    \n  \u2022  income tax rates on the then fair        \n     market value of the shares. The Firm is  \n     required to withhold tax on the amount   \n     of income so recognized, and a           \n     deduction corresponding to the amount    \n     of income recognized will be allowable   \n     to the Firm (subject to Section 162(m)   \n     of the Internal Revenue Code). The       \n     Participant\u2019s tax basis in the shares    \n     will be equal to the ordinary income so  \n     recognized. Upon subsequent disposition  \n     of the shares, the Participant will      \n     realize long-term or short-term capital  \n     gain or loss.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Pursuant to Section 83(b) of the         \n     Internal Revenue Code, the Participant   \n     may elect within 30 days of receipt of   \n     the Award to be taxed at ordinary        \n     income tax rates on the fair market      \n     value of the shares comprising such      \n     Award at the time of Award (determined   \n     without regard to any restrictions       \n     which may lapse) less any amount paid    \n     for the shares. In that case, the        \n     Participant will acquire a tax basis in  \n     the shares equal to the ordinary income  \n  \u2022  recognized by the Participant at the     \n     time of Award. No tax will be payable    \n     upon the lapse or release of the         \n     restrictions or at the time the shares   \n     first become transferable, and any gain  \n     or loss upon subsequent disposition      \n     will be a capital gain or loss. In the   \n     event of a forfeiture of shares of       \n     common stock with respect to which a     \n     Participant previously made a Section    \n     83(b) election, the Participant will     \n     generally not be entitled to a loss      \n     deduction.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Nonqualified Stock Options.The grant of  \n     a nonqualified stock option will not     \n     result in the recognition of taxable     \n     income by the Participant or in a        \n     deduction to the Firm. Upon exercise, a  \n     Participant will recognize ordinary      \n     income in an amount equal to the excess  \n     of the fair market value of the shares   \n     of common stock purchased over the       \n     exercise price, and a tax deduction is   \n     allowable to the Firm equal to the       \n  \u2022  amount of such income (subject to        \n     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue   \n     Code). Gain or loss upon a subsequent    \n     sale of any shares received upon the     \n     exercise of a nonqualified stock option  \n     generally would be taxed as either       \n     long-term or short-term capital gain or  \n     loss, depending upon the holding period  \n     of the shares sold. Certain additional   \n     rules apply if the exercise price for    \n     an option is paid in shares previously   \n     owned by the Participant.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     ISOs.Upon the grant or exercise of an    \n     ISO within the meaning of Section 422    \n     of the Internal Revenue Code, no income  \n     will be realized by the Participant for  \n     federal income tax purposes and the      \n     Firm will not be entitled to any         \n     deduction. However, the excess of the    \n     fair market value of the shares of       \n     common stock as of the date of exercise  \n     over the exercise price will constitute  \n     an adjustment to taxable income for      \n     purposes of the alternative minimum      \n     tax. If the shares are not disposed of   \n     within the one-year period beginning on  \n     the date of the transfer of such shares  \n     to the Participant or within the         \n     two-year period beginning on the date    \n     of grant of the stock option, any        \n     profit realized by the Participant upon  \n     the disposition of such shares will be   \n     taxed as long-term capital gain and no   \n     deduction will be allowed to the Firm.   \n     If the shares are disposed of within     \n     the one-year period from the date of     \n     transfer of such shares to the           \n     Participant or within the two-year       \n     period from the date of grant of the     \n     stock option, the excess of the fair     \n  \u2022  market value of the shares on the        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT115  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                          \n  Other Company Proposal  \n                          \ndate of exercise or, if less, the fair market \nvalue on the date of disposition, over the    \nexercise price will be taxable as ordinary    \nincome to the Participant at the time of      \ndisposition, and a corresponding deduction    \nwill be allowable to the Firm (subject to     \nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code). \nCertain additional rules apply if the exercise\nprice for a stock option is paid in shares    \npreviously owned by the Participant.          \n                                              \n     SARs.The grant of SARs will not result   \n     in the recognition of taxable income by  \n     the Participant or in a deduction to     \n     the Firm. Upon exercise, a Participant   \n     will recognize ordinary income in an     \n     amount equal to the then fair market     \n     value of the shares of common stock or   \n     cash distributed to the Participant.     \n  \u2022  The Firm is entitled to a tax deduction  \n     equal to the amount of such income       \n     (subject to Section 162(m) of the        \n     Internal Revenue Code). Gain or loss     \n     upon a subsequent sale of any shares     \n     received upon the exercise of SARs       \n     generally would be taxed as long-term    \n     or short-term capital gain or loss,      \n     depending upon the holding period of     \n     the shares sold.                         \n                                              \nEquity Compensation Plan Information The      \nfollowing table provides information about    \noutstanding awards and shares of common stock \navailable for future awards under all of      \nMorgan Stanley\u2019s equity compensation plans as \nof December 31, 2024.

Through \nthis process, we seek to understand the       \npriorities of our shareholders along with     \ntheir perspectives and issues of concern. We  \nalso recognize that the submission of         \nshareholder proposals for vote at our annual  \nmeeting is another alternative for certain of \nour shareholders to convey their views and    \nareas of focus to other shareholders; however,\nwe believe advance dialogue may be more       \nconstructive.

This analysis often includes   \n     assessing the efficacy of the request    \n     in the proposal, including whether the   \n     Firm has already addressed the           \n     essential objective of the proposal.     \n                                              \n                                              \n     Seek to engage directly with the         \n     shareholder proponent in a constructive  \n     dialogue to understand their             \n     concernsand provide the Firm\u2019s views on  \n     the topic of the proposal, including     \n     the Firm\u2019s initiatives, policies and     \n     practices relevant to the topic. At      \n  \u2022  times, we learn through discussions      \n     with shareholder proponents that their   \n     interests in the Firm are focused on     \n     areas that are different than the        \n     specific request set forth in the        \n     proposal or that their ultimate goal is  \n     simply for other shareholders to vote    \n     on the proposal rather than try to       \n     reach resolution with us.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Assess as appropriate whether it is in   \n     the best interest of the Firm,           \n     including our clients and other          \n     shareholders, to implement the material  \n  \u2022  aspects of the proposal or respond in    \n     other meaningful ways, such\u00a0as by        \n     enhancing or providing additional        \n     disclosure, in alignment with our        \n     existing business strategy and           \n     priorities.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Work toward finding mutually agreeable   \n     solutions whenever possible through our  \n     process and by offering extensive        \n     dialogue with shareholder proponents;    \n     however, we may ultimately determine     \n     that that the viewpoints expressed in    \n     the proposal cover general societal      \n     concerns and are not related to          \n     specific issues at the Firm, are         \n     inconsistent with the perspective of     \n  \u2022  other shareholders or the Firm\u2019s         \n     business strategy or values or even      \n     pose risks to the Firm.

Proponent\u2019s Statement     \nEnergy Supply Ratio Resolved: Shareholders    \nrequest Morgan Stanley (\u201cCompany\u201d) disclose   \nannually its Energy Supply Ratio (\u201cESR\u201d),     \ndefined as its total financing through equity \nand debt underwriting, and project finance, in\nlow-carbon energy supply relative to that in  \nfossil-fuel energy supply. The disclosure,    \nprepared at reasonable expense and excluding  \nconfidential information, shall describe      \nCompany's methodology, including what it      \nclassifies as \u201clow carbon\u201d or \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d  \nCompany should include lending in its ESR if  \nmethodologically sound. Supporting Statement: \nAs a major global bank, Company is broadly    \nexposed to financial stability risks posed by \nclimate change and has made certain climate-  \nrelated commitments. Banks aligning their     \nactivities with their climate goals are better\nprepared to manage risk, including legal,     \nreputational and financial risks associated   \nwith climate change and capitalize on         \nopportunities associated with the global      \nenergy transition. According to the           \nInternational Energy Agency, reaching net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires     \nrapid transition away from fossil fuels and   \ntripling in global annual clean energy        \ninvestment by 2030. 1The pace at which low-   \ncarbon energy supply is scaled up will dictate\nthe rate at which fossil fuels are phased     \ndown. 2 Company is reportedly among the       \nlargest global financiers of fossil fuels;    \nhowever, it has committed to the goals of     \nreaching net zero financed emissions by 2050  \nand mobilizing $750 billion to support low-   \ncarbon and green solutions by 2030. 3Although \nCompany has robust commitments to sustainable \nfinance, investors need further disclosure to \nassess its clean energy financing activity and\nrelative financing of fossil fuels. The ESR, a\ndollar-based metric, will complement and      \nsupplement Company\u2019s existing emissions-based \nclimate financial disclosures, including any  \ndisclosures under European Union reporting    \nrequirements, and provide decision-useful     \ndisclosure on Company\u2019s activities and        \nprogress toward its public commitments. In    \nrecent years, banks reportedly earned more in \nlending and underwriting fees from clean      \nenergy projects than from oil and gas, and    \ncoal companies. 4Investors seek to assess     \nwhether Company is positioning itself as a    \nleader in the energy transition.              \n                                              \n  1  https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-r\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Executive summary \u2013 Net Zero Roadmap: A  \n  2  Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 \u00b0C Goal   \n     in Reach \u2013 Analysis - IEA                \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.morganstanley.com/content/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/article\u2026  \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT119  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Shareholder Proposal  \n                        \nThe ESR has become a key climate disclosure   \nmetric. Bloomberg provides to its clients ESRs\nfor global banks, including Company, using a  \nstandardized methodology with clear           \ndefinitions for \u201clow carbon\u201d and \u201cfossil      \nfuel,\u201d however, it excludes lending. 5Three   \nleading North American Banks, Citi, JPMorgan  \nand Royal Bank of Canada committed to disclose\nan ESR, and their methodology, demonstrating  \nthat disclosure is feasible and leading market\npractice. Investors believe Company should    \nsimilarly disclose its annual ESR for which it\nis accountable, and work toward an industry-  \nstandard approach for calculating and         \nreporting it. Bloomberg published an          \nImplementation Guide 6and the Institute of    \nInternational Finance, a financial industry   \nassociation with around 400 members globally, \npublished a 2024 whitepaper that provides a   \npotential format for standardized disclosure  \nof methodological design choices. 7 Statement \nof the Board Recommending a Vote Against this \nProposal The Board believes that this proposal\nis not in the best interest of Morgan Stanley \nor its shareholders and opposes this proposal \nfor the reasons discussed below.              \n                                              \n       \u200bWe consider climate throughout our     \n       business, operational and risk         \n  \u2022    management activities. We have a       \n       thoughtful climate strategy that       \n       leverages standardized approaches to   \n       climate reporting.                     \n       \u200bWe carefully consider our disclosures  \n       to enable our shareholders and         \n       stakeholders to understand our         \n       progress against our established       \n  \u2022    goals. However, the proposed Energy    \n       Supply Ratio (ESR) is not a            \n       meaningful or relevant representation  \n       of our progress towards our climate    \n       strategy.                              \n       \u200bIt would be imprudent for us to        \n       disclose the proposed ESR because it   \n       is a nascent metric that does not      \n       have a standardized industry-wide      \n  \u2022    methodology, which limits its          \n       comparability and usefulness to        \n       shareholders. Moreover, preparation    \n       of an ESR would not be a prudent use   \n       of our resources.                      \n       \u200bPublication of the proposed ESR may    \n       lead to the expectation that we        \n       manage and demonstrate progress        \n  \u2022    against a new metric that is not       \n       integrated into our business           \n       strategy, as well as it is unclear     \n       what the expected ESR should be over   \n       time.                                  \n                                              \nWe consider climate throughout our business,  \noperational and risk management activities.

However, the proposed ESR, \nwhich focuses on the relative level of funding\nprovided to clean energy and fossil fuel      \nactivities, is not a meaningful or relevant   \nrepresentation of our progress towards our    \nclimate strategy.                             \n                                              \n     We have set clear, science-aligned 2030  \n     goals that strive to lower our financed  \n     emissions along a trajectory that seeks  \n     to help limit warming to between         \n     1.5-1.7oC. Emissions are the key metric  \n  \u2022  to determine progress in limiting        \n     warming. This approach is also in        \n     accordance with standard market          \n     practice for U.S. and global banks.      \n     There is not a clear link between the    \n     ESR and related emissions outcomes.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Moreover, the ESR could also be          \n     influenced by a range of arbitrary       \n     factors that would fluctuate based on    \n     variables largely outside of our         \n     control, including the capital needs of  \n  \u2022  various clients, and the pace and        \n     development of new climate               \n     technologies. Because of many potential  \n     drivers impacting the ESR, this metric   \n     may not reflect the progress we may be   \n     making on our existing goals.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     In our annual ESG report, we update our  \n     shareholders and wider stakeholders on   \n     our progress in addressing our financed  \n  \u2022  emissions. We plan to continue this      \n     practice going forward, reporting our    \n     absolute financed emissions as well as   \n     physical intensity metrics.              \n                                              \nIt would be imprudent for us to disclose the  \nproposed ESR because it is a nascent metric   \nthat does not have a standardized industry-   \nwide methodology, which limits its            \ncomparability and usefulness to shareholders. \nMoreover, preparation of an ESR would not be a\nprudent use of our resources.                 \n                                              \n     Although some industry bodies have       \n     provided frameworks for calculating an   \n  \u2022  ESR, they provide a suite of design      \n     decision options with no standard or     \n     recommended approach.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     The proposal requests that we both       \n     disclose our proprietary version of      \n     this metric and work towards an          \n     industry standard approach. Developing   \n     and disclosing our own version of the    \n  \u2022  metric could lead to further             \n     fragmentation in the market, since it    \n     may not be comparable to other versions  \n     of the metric available to shareholders  \n     and make it more difficult to have a     \n     market standard over time.               \n                                              \n                                              \n     Accordingly, it is unclear what the      \n     incremental value to shareholders would  \n     be of publishing an additional           \n     proprietary metric that may not be       \n     comparable to other firms or data        \n     providers. This includes the ESR         \n     calculated by Bloomberg that is cited    \n  \u2022  in the supporting statement to the       \n     proposal and already publicly available  \n     for the global banks. Based on           \n     published reports, we believe Bloomberg  \n     calculates the ESR metric differently    \n     from those published by certain peers,   \n     which may cause confusion as to which    \n     metric is more accurate.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     The considerable data gathering and      \n     reporting efforts that would be          \n  \u2022  required to develop and annually report  \n     on this metric would not be a prudent    \n     use of our resources.                    \n                                              \nPublication of the proposed ESR may lead to   \nthe expectation that we manage and demonstrate\nprogress against a new metric that is not     \nintegrated into our business strategy, as well\nas it is unclear what the expected ESR should \nbe over time.                                 \n                                              \n     It is possible that if we disclose the   \n     ESR requested by the proposal, other     \n     stakeholders may ask us to have targets  \n     tied to it. There may be expectations    \n  \u2022  to manage to and show progress against   \n     the ratio which may be difficult and at  \n     times conflict with our current          \n     targets, particularly because it is      \n     unclear what other stakeholders may      \n     consider to be an ideal ESR.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     While the supporting statement           \n     indicates that a few banks have begun    \n     or intend to disclose their own version  \n     of this metric, this does not make it a  \n  \u2022  \u201ckey\u201d disclosure metric as argued by     \n     the proponent. This metric is still      \n     nascent and has not become an industry   \n     standard among many other public         \n     company banks that provide similar       \n     types of financing activities.           \n                                              \n                                              \n     We believe that it is critical that we   \n     have the flexibility and discretion to   \n  \u2022  determine our own metrics and targets    \n     with respect to how we manage our        \n     climate strategy.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     Accordingly, it is unclear what the      \n     incremental value to shareholders would  \n  \u2022  be of publishing an additional           \n     proprietary metric that may not be       \n     consistent with our net-zero strategy    \n     of reducing our financed emissions.      \n                                              \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT121  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Shareholder Proposal  \n                        \nIn sum, the Firm already discloses financed   \nemissions data, and reports on progress       \ntowards our $1 trillion sustainable finance   \ntarget and the $750 billion low-carbon and    \ngreen solutions subset.

If you hold shares     \nthrough a broker, follow the voting           \ninstructions you receive from your broker. If \nyou do not submit voting instructions, the    \nbroker will submit a proxy for your shares    \nvoting discretionary items but will not vote  \nnon-discretionary items. This results in a    \n\u201cbroker non-vote\u201d for non-discretionary items.\n                                              \n     All items, other than the ratification   \n     of the appointment of Morgan Stanley\u2019s   \n     independent auditor, are                 \n     \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d items.

Your shares     \n     will remain unvoted for such items if    \n     your NYSE member broker does not         \n     receive voting instructions from you.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     The ratification of the appointment of   \n  \u2022  Morgan Stanley\u2019s independent auditor is  \n     a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d item.                  \n                                              \nHow Do I Submit Voting Instructions for Shares\nHeld in My Name? If you hold shares as a      \nrecord shareholder, you may have your shares  \nvoted by submitting a proxy for your shares by\nmail, telephone or the Internet as described  \non the proxy card. If you submit your proxy   \nvia the Internet, you may incur Internet      \naccess charges. Submitting your proxy will not\nlimit your right to vote at the annual        \nmeeting. A properly completed and submitted   \nproxy will be voted in accordance with your   \ninstructions, unless you subsequently revoke  \nyour proxy in accordance with the procedures  \ndescribed below (see \u201cHow Can I Revoke My     \nProxy?\u201d). If you submit a signed proxy card   \nwithout indicating your voting instructions,  \nthe person voting the proxy will vote your    \nshares according to the Board\u2019s               \nrecommendations. How Do I Submit Voting       \nInstructions for Shares Held in Employee      \nPlans? If you hold shares in, or have been    \nawarded stock units under, certain employee   \nplans, you will separately receive directions \non how to submit your voting instructions.    \nShares held in the following employee plans   \nalso are subject to the following rules:      \n401(k) Plan. The Northern Trust Company       \n(Northern Trust), the 401(k) Plan\u2019s trustee,  \nmust receive your voting instructions for the \ncommon stock held on your behalf in the 401(k)\nPlan on or before May 12, 2025. If Northern   \nTrust does not receive your voting            \ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares together with other unvoted, forfeited \nand unallocated shares in the 401(k) Plan in  \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives from other participants in   \nthe 401(k) Plan. On March 17, 2025, there were\n26,318,305 shares in the 401(k) Plan. Other   \nEquity-Based Plans. State Street Global       \nAdvisors Trust Company acts as trustee for the\nTrust that holds shares of common stock       \nunderlying stock units awarded to employees   \nunder several of Morgan Stanley\u2019s equity-based\nplans. Employees allocated shares held in the \nTrust must submit their voting instructions   \nfor receipt by the trustee on or before May   \n12, 2025. If the trustee does not receive your\ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares, together with shares held in the Trust\nthat are unallocated or held on behalf of     \nformer Morgan Stanley employees and employees \nin certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., in \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives for shares held in the Trust \nin connection with such plans. On March 17,   \n2025, 51,930,212 shares were held in the Trust\nin connection with such plans. How Can I      \nRevoke My Proxy? You can revoke your proxy at \nany time before your shares are voted by (1)  \ndelivering a written revocation notice prior  \nto the annual meeting to Martin M. Cohen,     \nCorporate Secretary, Morgan Stanley, 1585     \nBroadway, Suite C, New York, New York 10036;  \n(2) submitting a later-dated proxy that we    \nreceive no later than when the polls close    \nduring the annual meeting; or (3) voting at   \nthe annual meeting. Attending the annual      \nmeeting does not revoke your proxy unless you \nvote at the meeting.                          \n                                          \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2025 PROXY STATEMENT125  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                        \n  Information About the Annual Meeting  \n                                        \nWhy Did I Receive a One-Page Notice Regarding \nthe Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? \nPursuant to SEC rules, we are mailing to      \ncertain of our shareholders a Notice about the\navailability of proxy materials on the        \nInternet instead of paper copies of the proxy \nmaterials. This process allows us to expedite \nour shareholders\u2019 receipt of proxy materials, \nlower the costs of distribution and reduce the\nenvironmental impact of our annual meeting.   \nAll shareholders receiving the Notice will    \nhave the ability to access the proxy materials\nand submit a proxy over the Internet. It is   \nimportant that you submit your proxy to have  \nyour shares voted. Instructions on how to     \naccess the proxy materials over the Internet  \nor to request a paper copy of the proxy       \nmaterials may be found in the Notice.
