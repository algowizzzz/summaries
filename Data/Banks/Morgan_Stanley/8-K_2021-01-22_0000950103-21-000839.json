Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s\nleadership, for 2020:\n                                              \n     The Firm achieved record financial       \n     performance in terms of revenues and     \n     profit before tax. Firm net revenues     \n     were $48.2 billion                       \n  \u2012  with net income applicable to Morgan     \n     Stanley of $11 billion. The Firm         \n     reported a full year ROTCE of 15.2% and  \n     earnings per share                       \n     of $6.46.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm continued execution of its      \n     long-term strategy with the Wealth       \n     Management acquisition of E*TRADE and    \n     the pending Investment                   \n     Management acquisition of Eaton Vance.   \n     The acquisition of E*TRADE positions     \n     the Firm as an industry leader in        \n  \u2012  Wealth Management                        \n     across all channels and segments and     \n     significantly increases the scale and    \n     breadth of the Firm\u2019s Wealth Management  \n     franchise.                               \n     The acquisition of Eaton Vance will      \n     establish Investment Management as a     \n     leading asset manager positioned for     \n     growth.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm continued a clear and           \n     consistent strategy to transform the     \n     business to emphasize more stable and    \n     durable balance                          \n     sheet and sources of revenue, which      \n     should provide more predictable results  \n     during various market conditions in the  \n     future.                                  \n     The Firm\u2019s strategy to transform the     \n     business was recognized by Moody\u2019s,      \n     with an upgrading of the Firm\u2019s          \n     rating to A2 senior (returning the Firm  \n     to its pre-financial crisis rating) and  \n  \u2012  then placing the rating under review     \n     for                                      \n     possible upgrade. The market also        \n     recognized the Firm\u2019s progress in 2020,  \n     as reflected in top performance in       \n     total                                    \n     shareholder return versus peers over 1,  \n     3 & 5 year periods. During 2020, the     \n     Morgan Stanley share price increased     \n     by 34% from $51.12 to $68.53, adding     \n     $42.6 billion in market value. In        \n     addition, the recent stress test         \n     results                                  \n     confirmed the Firm\u2019s solid capital       \n     position.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm focused on the health and       \n     wellbeing of its employees against an    \n     extremely challenging backdrop that      \n     included the COVID                       \n     health crisis, extraordinary client      \n     financing demand, an increase in         \n     corporate defaults and bankruptcies,     \n     and record market volumes.               \n     Early in the crisis, the Firm committed  \n     to making no reductions in its           \n     workforce through 2020, providing        \n     reassurance to its employees             \n     in a very difficult time. The Firm also  \n     implemented changes in the best          \n     interest of its employees in response    \n  \u2012  to the COVID-19 pandemic,                \n     including having the vast majority of    \n     its employees work from home and         \n     providing productivity resources when    \n     necessary, while implementing            \n     additional safety measures for           \n     employees continuing critical on-site    \n     work, COVID-19 specific medical          \n     benefits, extended childcare             \n     benefits, mental health resources and    \n     modified work schedules. In addition,    \n     the Firm announced a commitment to       \n     provide financial                        \n     assistance to 2,000 street vendors       \n     across New York City who were suffering  \n     from COVID-19 related business losses.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     The Firm strengthened its commitment to  \n     diversity and inclusion. As part of its  \n     continuing efforts in this area, the     \n     Firm added                               \n     a commitment to diversity and inclusion  \n     as its fifth core value and announced    \n     the creation of the Institute for        \n     Inclusion, a Firm-wide                   \n     effort chaired by Mr. Gorman with the    \n     mission to invest in underserved         \n     communities, advance equity through      \n     giving, and drive workplace              \n  \u2012  diversity and inclusion. The Firm also   \n     supported a number of external           \n     organizations driving racial equity,     \n     including the NAACP                      \n     Legal Defense and Education Fund,        \n     Carver Bank, and three top Historically  \n     Black Colleges and Universities.
