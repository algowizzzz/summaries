I hope                 \n  that you will be able to                    \n  attend, and if not, I                       \n  encourage you to vote by                    \n  proxy.

Against the backdrop                  \n  of a complex and challenging                \n  macroeconomic environment,                  \n  Morgan Stanley delivered                    \n  strong results and produced                 \n  a return on                                 \n  average tangible common                     \n  equity (ROTCE) of 15.3% for                 \n  the full year. The Firm                     \n  reported annual net revenues                \n  of $53.7 billion and net                    \n  income of $11.0 billion \u2013                   \n  the second highest in our                   \n  history.                                    \n                                              \nThese results show the resilient strategy we  \nhave put in place, with the steadfast support \nof your Board of Directors, that is designed  \nfor Morgan Stanley to excel when market and   \neconomic conditions are good and provide      \nstable performance when conditions are        \ndifficult. Our acquisitions of E*TRADE and    \nEaton Vance have accelerated the decade long  \ntransformation of Morgan Stanley into a       \ncompany with a sustainable business model with\nboth scale and momentum. Today, we are a more \nbalanced company, with leading competitive    \npositions in each of our three major business \nsegments, producing higher and more consistent\nreturns. Our strong brand and franchise are   \ngenerating tangible results as we collaborate \nacross our segments with a coordinated,       \nclient-focused approach. Our diversified      \nglobal franchise is well positioned to drive  \ngrowth over the next decade. Institutional    \nSecurities is a top three global leader in the\nindustry as demonstrated by wallet share. We  \nremain a leader in Equity and Investment      \nBanking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed   \nIncome franchise to focus on our strongest    \ncapabilities. Scale in our global businesses  \nhas been the foundation for gaining market    \nshare, and our competitive position is strong.\nOur Wealth and Investment Management          \nbusinesses together held $5.5 trillion in     \nclient assets at the end of 2022. We have     \nsignificant scale advantages in these         \nbusinesses and our longer-term goal is to grow\nthese assets to $10 trillion. The earnings    \npower underlining these businesses will serve \nas an economic engine for the Firm for a long \ntime. The strategic decisions we made over the\npast decade have transformed Morgan Stanley\u2019s \nbusiness model. We now derive half of our pre-\ntax profit from Wealth and Investment         \nManagement, and we expect they will become an \nincreasingly larger driver of the Firm\u2019s pre- \ntax profit in the future. This provides       \nstability that will be further enhanced as we \ncontinue to grow our client assets, while our \npreeminent Institutional Securities franchise \nwill continue to be a driver of incremental   \nrevenue, particularly in active markets. We   \nhave built unique competitive advantages      \naround each of our businesses and have        \nsignificant opportunities to maximize growth  \nin the years ahead. Our future growth and     \nlong-term success will also be driven by the  \ndepth of talent across our Firm and a strong  \nculture that guides our employees. We will    \ncontinue to invest in and nurture the depth of\ntalent and leadership we have across our      \norganization, broaden the diversity of this   \ntalent, and strengthen our culture of         \naccountability, collaboration and inclusion.  \nThe senior management team is strong and      \nexperienced, and our employees are the        \nfoundation of our Firm, driving our business  \ngrowth and sustaining our culture.            \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT1  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS Building an increasingly    \ndiverse workforce across the entire           \norganization remains central to our values,   \nand we continue to take steps to ensure that  \nour employees reflect the demographics of the \ncommunities in which we live and work. We have\ndeepened our efforts to recruit, advance and  \nretain diverse talent through a holistic      \napproach focused on professional development, \nhealth and wellbeing, benefits, and culture.  \nInvesting in broadening the diversity of our  \nemployees and continuing to reinforce our     \nculture remain important objectives for our   \nBoard of Directors and management teams across\nthe world. Our Board of Directors and         \nmanagement value the views of our shareholders\nand engage with them year-round on a broad    \nrange of topics, including our strategy,      \nfinancial performance, executive compensation,\ncorporate governance, human capital management\nand environmental and social goals.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS As in prior years,\nthe CMDS Committee used a well-defined        \nframework to determine CEO compensation for   \n2022, including establishing a target         \ncompensation range for the CEO and guidelines \nfor the CEO performance assessment, including \nperformance priorities based on the Company\u2019s \nstrategic objectives. Based on an evaluation  \nof 2022 Company and CEO performance, including\nsolid financial performance and outstanding   \nindividual performance, the CMDS Committee set\nCEO total compensation for 2022 at $31.5      \nmillion, down 10% from $35 million for 2021,  \nwith shareholder-aligned features. Under Mr.  \nGorman\u2019s leadership, for 2022, the Company\u2019s  \nbalanced business model demonstrated          \nresilience to adverse markets and performed as\nintended, allowing for growth and sustainable \ncapital return:                               \n                                              \n     Net revenues were $53.7\u00a0billion and Net  \n  \u2022  Income was $11\u00a0billion, or $6.15 per     \n     diluted share.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Reported full-year ROTCE of 15.3% and    \n     an Expense Efficiency Ratio of 73%, and  \n     the standardized CET1 Ratio at December  \n     31, 2022 was                             \n  \u2022  15.3%.                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Continued to increase returns to         \n     shareholders. The quarterly dividend     \n  \u2022  was increased by 11% to $0.775, with     \n     total dividends paid of                  \n     $5.1\u00a0billion, and the Company            \n     repurchased $9.9\u00a0billion in shares.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Continued to deliver leading long-term   \n     shareholder return and premium           \n  \u2022  valuation relative to peers and          \n     improvement in rating agency             \n     profile.                                 \n                                              \nIn addition, Mr. Gorman maintained focus on   \nthe Company\u2019s risk and control framework, made\nthoughtful changes to further the development \nof members of senior leadership, and continued\nthe Company\u2019s commitment to diversity and     \ninclusion. In determining Mr. Gorman\u2019s total  \ncompensation for 2022, the CMDS Committee also\ntook into consideration that, notwithstanding \nthe above, in a challenging economic and      \nmarket environment, Company performance for   \n2022 was not as strong as the prior year in   \nwhich the Company achieved record financial   \nperformance and the Company\u2019s shareholder     \nreturn for 2022 was down.                     \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT7  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nConsistent with previous years\u2019 compensation  \nand shareholder feedback over the years, 75%  \nof Mr. Gorman\u2019s incentive compensation is     \ndeferred over three years and is subject to   \ncancellation, 60% of Mr. Gorman\u2019s incentive   \ncompensation is delivered in performance-     \nvested equity, and 100% of Mr. Gorman\u2019s       \ndeferred incentive compensation is delivered  \nin the form of equity awards, aligning his    \ncompensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. As \ndiscussed in Section 4.3 of the CD&A, for     \ngrants beginning in 2023, the CMDS Committee  \namended the performance-vested equity awards  \nto ensure that the awards continue to be      \naligned with Company performance and strategic\nobjectives, while maintaining strong alignment\nwith shareholder interests. Under Mr. Gorman\u2019s\nleadership, our business model performed well \nin a difficult economic and market            \nenvironment. The Company achieved solid       \nfinancial performance in terms of revenues,   \nNet Income, ROTCE, and earnings per share,    \nalthough not as strong as the prior year in   \nwhich the Company achieved record results.    \n                                        \n  8MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nDuring 2022, the Company continued its clear  \nand consistent strategy to transform the      \nbusiness to emphasize a more stable balance   \nsheet and sources of revenue, which performed \nas designed during a challenging market       \nenvironment, and should provide more durable  \nresults during various market conditions in   \nthe future. In making progress on these long- \nterm strategic objectives, the Company also   \ncontinued on the path to meeting the goals    \nannounced at the beginning of 2022, as        \ndescribed in more detail in the following     \ntable. During 2022, the Company also continued\nto execute on growth objectives in each of its\nbusinesses. The Company continued to          \nsuccessfully integrate its E*TRADE Financial  \nCorporation (E*TRADE) and Eaton Vance Corp.   \n(Eaton Vance) acquisitions, which have        \nsignificantly increased the scale and breadth \nof its Wealth and Investment Management       \nfranchises and helped change the mix of its   \nbusiness, which on the whole is more balance  \nsheet-light and benefits from more fee-based  \nrevenues. In 2022, ISG continued to maintain  \nstrong market share in each of its major      \nbusinesses. WM, which has industry-leading    \nadvisor-led, self-directed and workplace      \nchannels, continued to grow net new assets and\nclient relationships. IM has grown its fee-   \nbased revenues and is positioned well for the \nfuture with a more diversified offering.      \n                                        \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT9  \n                                        \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                            \n  Overview of Voting Items  \n                            \nThe Company also continued to increase returns\nto shareholders.

Although Company and CEO performance  \nin 2022 were strong in a challenging economic \nand market environment, Company financial     \nperformance was not as strong as the prior    \nyear in which the Company achieved record     \nfinancial performance, and the CMDS Committee \ndetermined that a 2022 pay decision for Mr.   \nGorman of $31.5 million, down 10% from $35    \nmillion in 2021, was appropriate. CEO         \ncompensation was delivered in a combination of\nbase salary, cash bonus, a time-vested        \ndeferred equity incentive compensation award, \nand a future performance-vested equity        \nincentive compensation award. A significant   \nportion of CEO pay is deferred, all of which  \nis awarded in equity, subject to future stock \nprice performance, cancellation and clawback  \nand, in the case of the performance-vested    \nequity award, subject to future achievement of\nspecified financial goals over a three-year   \nperiod. The CMDS Committee believes this      \napproach to executive compensation supports   \nthe Company\u2019s pay for performance philosophy  \nand key compensation objectives, and is       \nconsistent with shareholder feedback, best    \npractices, and regulatory principles.         \nSHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT At our 2022 annual     \nmeeting of shareholders, approximately 95% of \nthe votes cast were in favor of our annual    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In anticipation of the \n2023 \u201cSay on Pay\u201d vote, we continued our      \nengagement program, seeking feedback from     \nshareholders and proxy advisory firms on a    \nvariety of topics, including our strategy,    \nfinancial performance, executive compensation,\ncorporate governance, human capital           \nmanagement, including diversity and inclusion,\nand environmental and social goals. With      \nrespect to executive compensation,            \nshareholders who provided feedback during our \nengagement program generally praised the      \nquality of the Company\u2019s disclosure and       \nreported that the Committee\u2019s use of          \ndiscretion in the administration of the       \nprogram is reasonable and that executive      \ncompensation at Morgan Stanley is viewed as   \nwell-aligned with performance. After carefully\nconsidering shareholder feedback and other    \nfactors, the CMDS Committee maintained its    \nperformance-based approach to executive       \ncompensation for 2022 and maintained the      \nproportion of incentive compensation granted  \nto the CEO in the form of performance-vested  \nstock unit awards at 60%.

In  \naddition, the Corporate Governance Policies   \nprovide that a director candidate should not  \nbe nominated for election if the candidate    \nwould be 72 years old or older at the time of \nelection.

The Board has also determined that \nElizabeth Corley, who retired from the Board  \neffective April 21, 2022, was independent     \nduring the time she served on the Board in    \n2022. To assess independence, the Board was   \nprovided with information about relationships \nbetween the independent directors (and their  \nimmediate family members and affiliated       \nentities) and Morgan Stanley and its          \naffiliates,                                   \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT35  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nincluding information about the directors\u2019    \nprofessional experience and affiliations. In  \nmaking its determination as to the independent\ndirectors, the Board reviewed the categories  \nof relationships between Morgan Stanley and   \nthe directors described above and the         \nfollowing specific relationships under those  \nDirector Independence Standards:              \n                                              \n     Commercial relationships (such as        \n     financial services offered by the        \n     Company to clients in the ordinary       \n     course of the Company\u2019s                  \n     business) in the last three years        \n     between Morgan Stanley and entities      \n     where the directors are employees or     \n     executive officers, or their immediate   \n     family members are executive officers    \n  \u2022  (Mss.

In each case  \n     the fees the                             \n     Company received were in compliance      \n     with the Director Independence           \n     Standards and the NYSE rules, and did    \n     not exceed the greater of $1\u00a0million or  \n     2% of such other entity\u2019s consolidated   \n     gross revenues in any of the last three  \n     years and                                \n     were considered immaterial to director   \n     independence.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Director\u2019s utilization of Morgan         \n     Stanley products and services offered    \n     by the Company as a client of the        \n     Company (such as Wealth                  \n     Management brokerage accounts and        \n     investments in funds sponsored by the    \n     Company) in the ordinary course of the   \n     Company\u2019s business on terms and          \n     conditions substantially similar to      \n     those provided to unaffiliated third     \n  \u2022  parties (Messrs.                         \n     Glocer and Herz, Mss.

All directors who   \nwere on the Board at the time, including all  \ncurrent directors who were nominees at the    \ntime, attended the 2022 annual meeting of     \nshareholders. Board Meetings and Committees   \nBOARD MEETINGS Our Board met 15 times during  \n2022. Each current director attended at least \n75% of the total number of meetings of the    \nBoard and committees on which such director   \nserved that were held during 2022 while the   \ndirector was a member. In addition to Board   \nand committee meetings, our directors also    \nengaged in less formal communications between \nmeetings, including discussions, briefings and\neducational sessions, with the Independent    \nLead Director, Chairman of the Board and CEO, \ncommittee chairs, members of senior management\nand others as appropriate regarding matters of\ninterest.

The Board regularly\nreviews the Company\u2019s risks and the           \nresponsibilities of management and the Board  \ncommittees to assist the Board in its risk    \noversight. The Board committees assist the    \nBoard in oversight of the risks set forth     \nbelow, coordinating as appropriate. In        \naddition, the entire Board receives reporting \non a quarterly basis regarding cross-         \nenterprise risks, including strategic,        \nreputational, and culture, values and conduct \nrisk. The committees report to the entire     \nBoard on a regular basis and have overlapping \ndirectors, invite Chairs of other committees  \nand other directors to attend meetings, as    \nappropriate given topics of discussion, and   \nhold joint meetings as necessary to discharge \ntheir duties. COORDINATION AMONG BOARD        \nCOMMITTEES REGARDING RISK OVERSIGHT           \n    \n    \n    \nThe Board has also authorized the Firm Risk   \nCommittee, a management committee appointed   \nand co-chaired by the CEO and CRO that        \nincludes the most senior officers of the      \nCompany, including the CLO and CAO, Head of   \nNon-Financial Risk, CFO and business heads, to\noversee the Company\u2019s global ERM framework.   \nThe Firm Risk Committee\u2019s responsibilities    \ninclude oversight of the Company\u2019s risk       \nmanagement principles, procedures and limits  \nand the monitoring of capital levels and      \nmaterial market, credit, operational, model,  \nliquidity, legal, compliance and reputational \nrisk matters, and other risks, as appropriate,\nand the steps management has taken to monitor \nand manage such risks.

The Operations and Technology      \nCommittee has primary responsibility for      \noversight of operations, technology and       \noperational risk, including information       \nsecurity, fraud, vendor, data protection and  \nprivacy, business continuity and resilience,  \nand cybersecurity risks (including review of  \ncybersecurity risks against established risk  \nmanagement methodologies). In accordance with \nits charter, the Operations and Technology    \nCommittee receives regular reporting at each  \nquarterly meeting from senior officers in the \nTechnology Department (Technology), Operations\nDepartment (Operations) and Non-Financial Risk\non operational risk and the steps management  \nhas taken to monitor and control such         \nexposures. Such reporting includes updates on \nthe Company\u2019s cybersecurity program, the      \nexternal threat environment, and the Company\u2019s\nprograms to address and mitigate the risks    \nassociated with the evolving cybersecurity    \nthreat environment. The Operations and        \nTechnology Committee also receives an annual  \nindependent assessment of key aspects of the  \nCompany\u2019s cybersecurity program from an       \nexternal party and holds joint meetings with  \nthe Audit Committee and Risk Committee, as    \nnecessary and appropriate. The Board or the   \nOperations and Technology Committee reviews   \nand approves the Global Cybersecurity Program \nPolicy, the Global Information Security       \nProgram Policy and the Global Technology      \nPolicy at least annually. The Chair of the    \nOperations and Technology Committee regularly \nreports to the Board on cybersecurity risks   \nand other matters reviewed by the Operations  \nand Technology Committee. In addition, the    \nBoard receives separate presentations on      \ncybersecurity risk and in accordance with the \nCorporate Governance Policies all Board       \nmembers are invited to attend Operations and  \nTechnology Committee meetings and have access \nto meeting materials. Senior management,      \nincluding the senior officers mentioned above,\ndiscuss cybersecurity developments with the   \nChair of the Operations and Technology        \nCommittee between Board and committee         \nmeetings, as necessary. The Operations and    \nTechnology Committee meets regularly in       \nexecutive session with management, including  \nthe Head of Non-Financial Risk, and senior    \nofficers from Technology and Operations.      \nASSESSMENT OF LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK   \nOVERSIGHT The Board has determined that its   \nleadership structure is appropriate for the   \nCompany. Mr. Gorman\u2019s role as CEO, his        \nexisting relationship with the Board, his     \nunderstanding of Morgan Stanley\u2019s businesses  \nand strategy, and his professional experience \nand leadership skills uniquely position him to\nserve as Chairman, while the Company\u2019s        \nIndependent Lead Director position enhances   \nthe overall independent function of the Board.\nThe Board believes that the combination of the\nChairman and CEO, the Independent Lead        \nDirector and the Chairs of the Audit, CMDS,   \nGovernance and Sustainability, Operations and \nTechnology, and Risk Committees provides the  \nappropriate leadership to help ensure         \neffective risk oversight by the Board.        \nCompensation Governance and Risk Management   \nThe CMDS Committee actively engages in its    \nduties and follows procedures intended to     \nensure excellence in compensation governance. \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee has the power to      \n     retain and terminate independent         \n     compensation consultants, legal          \n     counsel, or financial or other           \n     advisors as it may deem necessary to     \n     assist it in the performance of its      \n     duties and responsibilities. For 2022,   \n     the CMDS Committee retained an           \n     independent compensation consultant,     \n     Pay Governance, to assist the CMDS       \n     Committee in                             \n     collecting and evaluating external       \n     market data regarding executive          \n     compensation and performance and to      \n     advise the CMDS Committee on developing  \n     trends and best practices in executive   \n     compensation and equity and incentive    \n  \u2022  plan design. In                          \n     performing these services, Pay           \n     Governance attended meetings of the      \n     CMDS Committee regularly, including      \n     portions of the meetings without         \n     management present, and separately with  \n     the CMDS Committee Chair. For 2022, the  \n     CMDS Committee also                      \n     retained an independent compensation     \n     consultant, Semler Brossy, to assist     \n     the CMDS Committee in the review and     \n     development of alternatives for a        \n     potential redesign of the Company\u2019s      \n     long-term incentive program (LTIP).

The CRO       \n     reported to the CMDS Committee his       \n     conclusion that the Company\u2019s current    \n     compensation programs for 2022 do not    \n     incentivize employees to take            \n     unnecessary or                           \n     excessive risk and that such programs    \n     do not create risks that are reasonably  \n     likely to have a material adverse        \n     effect on the Company.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     The CMDS Committee approves senior       \n     executive annual incentive compensation  \n     after a comprehensive review and         \n  \u2022  evaluation of Company,                   \n     business unit and individual             \n     performance for the year, and reviews    \n     these compensation decisions with our    \n     Board.                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Together with senior management, the     \n     CMDS Committee oversees the Company\u2019s    \n     controls regarding the year-end          \n     compensation process,                    \n     including policies and procedures for    \n     compensation plan governance, funding    \n  \u2022  and allocating the incentive             \n     compensation pool and the use of         \n     discretion in determining individual     \n     incentive compensation awards;           \n     processes for identifying                \n     \u201crisk-taking\u201d employees; and processes   \n     to administer incentive compensation     \n     clawback and cancellation features.      \n                                              \nDirector Compensation Our director            \ncompensation program is guided by three goals:\ncompensation should fairly pay directors for  \nwork required in a company of our size and    \nscope; compensation should align directors\u2019   \ninterests with the long-term interests of     \nshareholders; and the structure of            \ncompensation should be easy for shareholders  \nto understand. The Board believes that a      \ndirector\u2019s total compensation should include a\nsignificant equity component because it       \nbelieves that this more closely aligns the    \nlong-term interests of directors with those of\nshareholders and provides a continuing        \nincentive for directors to foster the         \nCompany\u2019s success. In furtherance of these    \ngoals, our directors are bound by a           \nshareholder-approved annual compensation (cash\nand equity) limit of $750,000 and an equity   \nownership requirement of five times the annual\ncash Board retainer (as described in more     \ndetail below under \u201cDirector Equity Ownership \nRequirement\u201d). Directors\u2019 compensation is     \ndetermined by the Board, and the Governance   \nand Sustainability Committee makes            \nrecommendations to the Board based on periodic\nbenchmarking assessments and advice received  \nfrom FW Cook, its independent advisor. In     \n2022, the Governance and Sustainability       \nCommittee evaluated the independence of FW    \nCook and affirmatively determined that FW Cook\nis independent and that FW Cook\u2019s engagement  \nby the Governance and Sustainability Committee\ndoes not raise any conflict of interest. In   \n2022, FW Cook conducted a customized review of\nthe design and pay levels of our director     \ncompensation program compared to competitive  \nmarket practices. Effective November 1, 2022, \nbased on the recommendation of the Governance \nand Sustainability Committee following its    \nreview with FW Cook, the Board increased the  \nvalue of the annual equity award by $10,000,  \nthe annual Board retainer by $20,000, the     \nannual Independent Lead Director retainer by  \n$50,000, and the annual chair retainers for   \nall committees except the Audit and Risk      \nCommittees by $5,000. The Board also          \neliminated all committee member fees.         \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT43  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                \n  Corporate Governance Matters  \n                                \nThe following table contains information with \nrespect to the annual compensation (including \ndeferred compensation) of our non-employee    \ndirectors earned during 2022 with respect to  \ntheir Board service.                          \n                                              \n                         C\u2026                   \n         F\u2026              in                   \n         E\u2026              P\u2026                   \n         or      S\u2026      V\u2026      All          \n  \u2026      P\u2026      A\u2026      a\u2026      Ot\u2026      T\u2026  \n         in      (\u2026      N\u2026      Co\u2026      (\u2026  \n         C\u2026              D\u2026      ($)          \n         (\u2026              C\u2026                   \n                         E\u2026                   \n                         (\u2026                   \n  \u2026      2\u2026       \u2014      \u2014       19\u2026      4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2014       \u2014      \u2014       21\u2026      2\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      9\u2026      3\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        4\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      9\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      1\u2026      2\u2026      \u2014       \u2014        3\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Ms.\u00a0Corley concluded service on the      \n     Board effective April\u00a021, 2022, and Mr.  \n     Hirano concluded service                 \n     on the Board effective May\u00a026, 2022,     \n     the date of the 2022 annual meeting of   \n     shareholders.

\nappointed Deloitte as independent auditor for \nthe year ending December 31, 2023 and,        \nalthough not legally required to do so,       \npresents this selection to the shareholders   \nfor ratification as a matter of governance    \nbest practices. The Audit Committee believes  \nthat the continued retention of Deloitte is in\nthe best interest of the Company and its      \nshareholders. Deloitte was selected as        \nindependent auditor upon the merger creating  \nthe current Company in 1997 and has served    \ncontinuously as independent auditor since that\ntime. Deloitte will audit the Company\u2019s       \nconsolidated financial statements included in \nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year   \nending December 31, 2023, and will perform    \nother permissible, pre-approved services. If  \nshareholders do not ratify the appointment of \nDeloitte, the Audit Committee will consider   \nthis in determining whether to appoint        \nDeloitte as independent auditor for the year  \nending December 31, 2024. Even if the         \nappointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, \nin its discretion, may change the appointment \nat any time during the year if it determines  \nthat such a change would be in the best       \ninterest of the Company and its shareholders. \nDeloitte representatives will attend the      \nannual meeting. They will be present to       \nrespond to appropriate shareholder questions  \nand will have the opportunity to make a       \nstatement if they desire to do so. Our Board  \nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201dthe \nratification of Deloitte\u2019s appointment as our \nindependent auditor. Proxies solicited by the \nBoard will be voted \u201cFOR\u201dthis ratification    \nunless otherwise instructed.                  \n                                         \n  48MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                 \n  Audit Matters  \n                 \nAudit Committee Report The Audit Committee\u2019s  \ncharter, available at                         \nwww.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance     \n(which webpage and charter are not            \nincorporated by reference in this proxy       \nstatement), provides that the Audit Committee \nis responsible for the oversight of the       \nintegrity of the Company\u2019s consolidated       \nfinancial statements, the Company\u2019s system of \ninternal control over financial reporting,    \ncertain aspects of the Company\u2019s risk         \nmanagement as described in the charter, the   \nqualifications and independence of the        \nindependent registered accounting firm engaged\nas the \u201cindependent auditor,\u201d the performance \nof the Company\u2019s internal auditor and         \nindependent auditor, and the Company\u2019s        \ncompliance with legal and regulatory          \nrequirements.

At the 2022 \nannual meeting of shareholders, approximately \n95% of the votes cast were in favor of our    \n\u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In light of the        \nsignificant majority of votes cast in favor of\nthe 2021 compensation of our NEOs, the CMDS   \nCommittee maintained its performance-based    \napproach to executive compensation for 2022   \nand believes that our current program         \nappropriately links the compensation of our   \nNEOs to performance and properly aligns the   \ninterests of our NEOs with those of our       \nshareholders. As discussed in the CD&A, the   \n2022 pay decision for the CEO was made by the \nCMDS Committee, in consultation with the      \nBoard. Based on an evaluation of 2022 Company \nand CEO performance, including solid financial\nperformance and outstanding individual        \nperformance, the CMDS Committee set CEO total \ncompensation for 2022 at $31.5 million, down  \n10% from $35 million for 2021, with           \nshareholder-aligned features. Under Mr.       \nGorman\u2019s leadership, for 2022, the Company\u2019s  \nbalanced business model demonstrated          \nresilience to adverse markets and performed as\nintended, allowing for growth and sustainable \ncapital return:                               \n                                              \n     Net revenues were $53.7\u00a0billion and Net  \n  \u2022  Income was $11\u00a0billion, or $6.15 per     \n     diluted share.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Reported full-year ROTCE of 15.3% and    \n     an Expense Efficiency Ratio of 73%, and  \n     the standardized CET1 Ratio at December  \n     31, 2022 was                             \n  \u2022  15.3%.                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Continued to increase returns to         \n     shareholders.

In determining Mr. Gorman\u2019s total  \ncompensation for 2022, the CMDS Committee also\ntook into consideration that, notwithstanding \nthe above, in a challenging economic and      \nmarket environment, Company performance for   \n2022 was not as strong as the prior year in   \nwhich the Company achieved record financial   \nperformance and the Company\u2019s shareholder     \nreturn for 2022 was down. Consistent with     \nprevious years\u2019 compensation and shareholder  \nfeedback over the years, 75% of Mr. Gorman\u2019s  \nincentive compensation is deferred over three \nyears and is subject to cancellation, 60% of  \nMr. Gorman\u2019s incentive                        \n                                         \n  52MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \ncompensation is delivered in performance-     \nvested equity, and 100% of Mr. Gorman\u2019s       \ndeferred incentive compensation is delivered  \nin the form of equity awards, aligning his    \ncompensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. As \ndiscussed in Section 4.3 of the CD&A, for     \ngrants beginning in 2023, the CMDS Committee  \namended performance-vested equity awards to   \nensure that the awards continue to be aligned \nwith Company performance and strategic        \nobjectives, while maintaining strong alignment\nwith shareholder interests. Our shareholders  \nare being asked to approve, on an advisory    \nbasis, the frequency with which we hold       \nadvisory votes to approve the compensation of \nour NEOs (see Item 4). As described in more   \ndetail in Item 4, the Board is recommending a \nvote for holding advisory votes to approve the\ncompensation of our NEOs every year.          \nAccordingly, the Board intends to hold the    \nnext advisory vote to approve our executive   \ncompensation program at the 2024 annual       \nmeeting of shareholders, unless the Board     \nmodifies its policy on the frequency of       \nholding such advisory votes including in      \nresponse to shareholders\u2019 votes on Item 4.

Based on an evaluation \nof 2022 Company and CEO performance, including\nsolid financial performance and outstanding   \nindividual performance, the CMDS Committee set\nCEO total compensation for 2022 at $31.5      \nmillion, down 10% from $35 million for 2021.  \nUnder Mr. Gorman\u2019s leadership, for 2022, the  \nCompany\u2019s balanced business model demonstrated\nresilience to adverse markets and performed as\nintended, allowing for growth and sustainable \ncapital return:                               \n                                              \n     Net revenues were $53.7\u00a0billion and Net  \n  \u2022  Income was $11\u00a0billion, or $6.15 per     \n     diluted share.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     Reported full year ROTCE of 15.3% and    \n     an Expense Efficiency Ratio of 73%, and  \n     the standardized CET1 Ratio at December  \n     31, 2022 was                             \n  \u2022  15.3%.                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Continued to increase returns to         \n     shareholders. The quarterly dividend     \n  \u2022  was increased by 11% to $0.775, with     \n     total dividends paid of                  \n     $5.1\u00a0billion, and the Company            \n     repurchased $9.9\u00a0billion in shares.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Continued to deliver leading long-term   \n     shareholder return and premium           \n  \u2022  valuation relative to peers and          \n     improvement in rating agency             \n     profile.                                 \n                                              \nIn addition, Mr. Gorman maintained focus on   \nthe Company\u2019s risk and control framework, made\nthoughtful changes to further the development \nof members of senior leadership, continued the\nCompany\u2019s commitment to diversity and         \ninclusion and continued to lead the Company\u2019s \nexecution of the successful integrations of   \nE*TRADE and EatonVance. In determining Mr.    \nGorman\u2019s total compensation for 2022, the CMDS\nCommittee also took into consideration that,  \nnotwithstanding the above, in a challenging   \neconomic and market environment, Company      \nperformance for 2022 was not as strong as the \nprior year in which the Company achieved      \nrecord financial performance and the Company\u2019s\nshareholder return for 2022 was down.         \nConsistent with previous years\u2019 compensation  \nand shareholder feedback over the years, 75%  \nof Mr. Gorman\u2019s incentive compensation is     \ndeferred over three years and is subject to   \ncancellation, 60% of Mr. Gorman\u2019s incentive   \ncompensation is delivered in future           \nperformance-vested equity, and 100% of Mr.    \nGorman\u2019s deferred incentive compensation is   \ndelivered in the form of equity awards,       \naligning his compensation with shareholders\u2019  \ninterests. In addition, as discussed in       \nSection 4.2, for grants beginning in 2023, the\nCMDS Committee amended the performance-vested \nequity awards to ensure that the awards       \ncontinue to be aligned with Company           \nperformance and strategic objectives, while   \nmaintaining strong alignment with shareholder \ninterests.                                    \n                                         \n  54MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n1.2 Framework for CEO Compensation Decision   \nThe CMDS Committee\u2019s framework for determining\nCEO compensation supports and reinforces the  \nCompany\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy and  \nincorporates the following key steps: Each    \nyear, the CMDS Committee establishes a target \ncompensation range for the CEO and outlines   \nguidelines for the CEO performance assessment \nat year end.                                  \n                                              \n                       \u200b                       \n  At the start of                             \n  2022, the CMDS                              \n  Committee, in                               \n  consultation                                \n  with its                                    \n  independent                                 \n  compensation                                \n  consultant,                                 \n  established a                               \n  target range for                            \n  CEO compensation as                         \n  well as the factors                         \n  to be considered in                         \n  determining          \u200b                       \n  year-end                                    \n  compensation.

In making    \nprogress on these long-term strategic         \nobjectives, the Company also continued on the \npath to meeting the goals announced at the    \nbeginning of 2022, as described in more detail\nin the following table.                       \n                                              \n     The attainment of these goals assumes a  \n     normal market environment and may be     \n     impacted                                 \n  *  by external factors that cannot be       \n     predicted at this time, including        \n     geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market  \n     conditions, and future legislation and   \n     regulations, and any changes thereto.    \n                                              \nDuring 2022, the Company also continued to    \nexecute on growth objectives in each of its   \nbusinesses. The Company continued to          \nsuccessfully integrate its E*TRADE and Eaton  \nVance acquisitions, which have significantly  \nincreased the scale and breadth of its Wealth \nand Investment Management franchises and      \nhelped change the mix of its business, which  \non the whole is more balance sheet-light and  \nbenefits from more fee-based revenues.

A         \nsignificant portion of pay is deferred, all of\nwhich is awarded in equity, subject to future \nstock price performance and cancellation and  \nclawback and, in the case of LTIP awards,     \nsubject to future achievement of specified    \nfinancial objectives over a three-year period.\n                                         \n  60MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThese compensation elements support the       \nCompany\u2019s key compensation objectives,        \ndiscussed in Section 2, including delivering  \npay for sustainable performance.              \n                                              \n                       \u2022\u200775% of 2022 CEO      \n  Deferred Incentive   incentive              \n  Compensation         compensation is        \n                       deferred over          \n                       three years            \n  \u2022\u2007Clawbacks cover                           \n  material adverse                            \n  outcomes, even                              \n  absent                                      \n  misconduct                                  \n  \u2022\u2007No automatic                              \n  vesting on change                           \n  in control; double                          \n  trigger                                     \n  in place                                    \n                       \u2022\u2007100% of CEO          \n  Equity-Based         deferred incentive     \n  Compensation         compensation awarded   \n                       in                     \n                       equity                 \n  \u2022\u2007Significant                               \n  portion of                                  \n  equity-based                                \n  compensation                                \n  aligns employee and                         \n  shareholderinteres\u2026                         \n  \u2022\u2007Meaningful share                          \n  ownership and                               \n  retention                                   \n  requirements                                \n  further shareholder                         \n  alignment                                   \n                       \u2022\u200760% of CEO 2022      \n  Performance-Vested   incentive              \n  Equity Incentive     compensation is        \n  Award                performance-vested,    \n                       consistent with        \n                       shareholder feedback   \n  \u2022\u2007Shares earned can                         \n  range from 0 to                             \n  1.5x target based                           \n  on                                          \n  three-year                                  \n  performance against                         \n  absolute and                                \n  relative ROTCE                              \n  objectives                                  \n  \u2022\u2007For 2023 awards                           \n  (for 2022 service),                         \n  replaced relative                           \n  TSR performance                             \n  objective with                              \n  relative ROTCE to                           \n  ensure award                                \n  continues to be in                          \n  alignment with                              \n  Company performance                         \n  and strategic                               \n  objectives, while                           \n  maintaining strong                          \n  alignment with                              \n  shareholder                                 \n  interests(new)                              \n                       \u2022\u2007Prohibitions on      \n  Best Practices       pledging, hedging,     \n                       selling short or       \n                       trading derivatives    \n  \u2022 No excise tax                             \n  protection upon a                           \n  change in                                   \n  control                                     \n  \u2022\u2007Annual risk                               \n  review                                      \n  \u2022\u2007CMDS Committee                            \n  retains independent                         \n  compensation                                \n  consultant                                  \n                                              \nSection 4.1 contains the compensation         \ndecisions (both the amount and mix of         \ncompensation elements) for each NEO. Sections \n4.2 and 4.3 contain more detail about the     \nelements and key features of our compensation \nprogram. 1.5 Ongoing Shareholder Engagement   \nand \u201cSay on Pay\u201d Vote Morgan Stanley is       \ncommitted to open and ongoing communication   \nwith our shareholders, and takes the          \nopportunity to engage with shareholders       \ndirectly on compensation and other matters to \nunderstand their perspectives and provide     \ninformation about Morgan Stanley\u2019s programs,  \nperformance assessment and decision-making    \nprocess. A substantial majority (approximately\n95%) of the votes cast at the May 2022 annual \nmeeting of shareholders were in favor of our  \nannual \u201cSay on Pay\u201d proposal. In 2022, we     \ncontinued our engagement program, seeking     \nfeedback from shareholders and proxy advisory \nfirms on a variety of topics, including our   \nstrategy, financial performance, executive    \ncompensation, corporate governance, human     \ncapital management, including diversity and   \ninclusion, and environmental and social goals.\nThe feedback that we received during the      \nengagement program was conveyed to the CMDS   \nCommittee and the Board. Shareholders who     \nprovided feedback during our engagement       \nprogram generally praised the quality of the  \nCompany\u2019s disclosure and reported that the    \nCommittee\u2019s use of discretion in the          \nadministration of the program is reasonable   \nand that executive compensation at Morgan     \nStanley is viewed as well-aligned with        \nperformance. The CMDS Committee factored      \nshareholder feedback, including the \u201cSay on   \nPay\u201d vote results, into its consideration of  \nthe executive compensation structure and      \ndetermination of 2022 NEO pay levels. After   \ncarefully considering shareholder feedback and\nother factors, the CMDS Committee maintained  \nits performance-based approach to executive   \ncompensation for 2022. In addition, as        \ndiscussed in Section 4.2, for grants beginning\nin 2023, the CMDS Committee amended the       \nperformance-vested equity awards to ensure    \nthat the awards continue to be aligned with   \nCompany performance and strategic objectives, \nwhile maintaining strong alignment with       \nshareholder interests.                        \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT61  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n2.

Framework for Making Compensation Decisions\n3.1 Factors Considered in Compensation        \nDecisions The 2022 compensation of the NEOs   \nwas determined by the CMDS Committee after    \nconsideration of Company business results,    \nstrategic performance, and individual         \nperformance, as well as competitor            \ncompensation data and, with respect to the    \nCEO, benchmarking data, and other             \nconsiderations set forth below. PERFORMANCE   \nPRIORITIES For 2022, a number of quantitative \nand qualitative performance priorities were   \nset by the CMDS Committee and the Board at the\nbeginning of the year. The performance        \npriorities are established based on a         \ndirectional assessment made at the beginning  \nof the year in light of the market            \nenvironment, and the Company\u2019s strategic      \nobjectives and their attainment or non-       \nattainment does not correspond to any specific\ncompensation decision. To inform its decision-\nmaking process for NEO compensation for 2022, \nthe CMDS Committee evaluated Company and      \nindividual performance in light of the pre-   \nestablished performance priorities.

BENCHMARKING TARGET CEO PAY As       \ndiscussed in Section 1.2, the CMDS Committee, \nin consultation with its independent          \ncompensation consultant, Pay Governance,      \nestablished a target range for 2022           \ncompensation for the CEO of $40 million or    \nmore for strong performance exceeding         \nexpectations to $20 million or less for       \nperformance below expectations. To inform its \ndecision-making with respect to the           \nappropriate target range, the CMDS Committee  \nreviewed available 2021 compensation levels   \nfor selected financial companies in the S&P   \n100 Index, which are intended to reflect      \ninstitutions of similar size, scope, and      \ncomplexity. The CMDS Committee then utilized  \nthe range of results as a benchmark from which\nto set the target range for 2022 compensation \nfor the CEO.                                  \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT63  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nRELATIVE PAY CONSIDERATIONS We place          \nimportance on the pay relationships among     \nmembers of our Operating Committee because we \nview our Operating Committee members as highly\ntalented executives capable of rotating among \nthe leadership positions of our businesses and\nkey functions. Our goal is always to be in a  \nposition to appoint our most senior executives\nfrom within our Company and to incentivize our\npeople to aspire to senior executive roles. At\nyear end, the CMDS Committee reviewed the     \nrelative differences between the compensation \nfor the CEO and other NEOs and between the    \nNEOs and other members of the Operating       \nCommittee. INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE \nCEO, INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AND INDEPENDENT   \nCONSULTANT At the end of the year, Mr. Gorman \npresented the CMDS Committee with performance \nassessments and compensation recommendations  \nfor each NEO, other than himself. The CMDS    \nCommittee reviewed these recommendations with \nits independent compensation consultant to    \nassess whether they were reasonable compared  \nwith the market for executive talent and met  \nin executive session to discuss the           \nperformance of our CEO and the other NEOs and \nto determine their compensation. In addition, \nthe CMDS Committee and Board reviewed proposed\nNEO incentive compensation with Mr. Gorman,   \nand the CMDS Committee reviewed CEO           \ncompensation with the Board (other than Mr.   \nGorman). COMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSIDERATIONS  \nPrior to determining individual NEO incentive \ncompensation, the CMDS Committee reviewed and \nconsidered the relationship between Company   \nperformance, total compensation expense (which\nincludes fixed compensation costs such as base\nsalaries, allowances, benefits, commissions,  \namortization of prior deferred compensation   \nawards and severance costs), and incentive    \ncompensation as a subset of overall           \ncompensation expense. This exercise furthers  \nthe balancing of the objectives of delivering \nreturns for shareholders, while providing     \nappropriate rewards to motivate superior      \nindividual performance. GLOBAL REGULATORY     \nPRINCIPLES The Company\u2019s compensation         \npractices are subject to oversight by our     \nregulators in the U.S. and internationally.   \nFor example, the Company is subject to the    \nFederal Reserve guidance that is designed to  \nhelp ensure that incentive compensation paid  \nby banking organizations does not encourage   \nimprudent risk-taking that threatens the      \norganizations\u2019 safety and soundness. The      \nCompany is also subject to the compensation-  \nrelated provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as  \nwell as the remuneration code of the U.K.     \nFinancial Conduct Authority and the U.K.      \nPrudential Regulation Authority (U.K. PRA)    \nRulebook, which prescribes the compensation   \nstructure for certain employees who are       \nidentified as material risk takers. TAX       \nDEDUCTIBILITY Section 162(m) of the Internal  \nRevenue Code (Section 162(m)) limits the tax  \ndeductibility of compensation for certain     \nexecutive officers that is more than $1       \nmillion. The CMDS Committee continues to have \nthe flexibility to pay non-deductible         \ncompensation if it believes it is in the best \ninterests of the Company.                     \n                                         \n  64MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \n3.2 Evaluating Company and Individual         \nPerformance for Alignment with Executive      \nCompensation As set forth in Section 1.3, in  \ndetermining the annual incentive compensation \nof the CEO and other NEOs, the CMDS Committee \nweighed the Company\u2019s overall financial       \nperformance and, as applicable, business unit \nperformance and achievement of its long-term  \nstrategic objectives. Management reviewed the \nCompany\u2019s forecasted 2022 financial           \nperformance with the CMDS Committee in        \nDecember 2022, and the CMDS Committee assessed\nfull-year actual financial results before     \nfinalizing compensation decisions in January  \n2023. COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND       \nSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES In 2022, Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nclear strategy and balanced business model    \nenabled the Company to deliver solid financial\nresults in a challenging market environment,  \nthough less than the record financial         \nperformance in 2021. The CMDS Committee       \nconsidered these results, as well as the      \nperformance indicated below, in determining   \ncompensation for our NEOs.                    \n

For other NEOs, the amount of      \nincentive compensation that is deferred is    \nbased on a deferral table, which results in a \nmore significant deferral at higher incentive \ncompensation levels.                          \n                                              \n         M\u2026      M\u2026      M\u2026      Mr.      M\u2026  \n         G\u2026      Y\u2026      P\u2026      Sa\u2026      S\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $1\u2026      $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $7\u2026      $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $5\u2026      $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $6\u2026      $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $\u2026      $2\u2026      $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr. Gorman received 46,397 RSUs, Ms.   \n       Yeshaya received 28,998 RSUs,          \n       Mr. Pick received 61,477 RSUs, Mr.     \n       Saperstein received 52,197 RSUs and    \n       Mr. Simkowitz received 61,992 RSUs     \n       (in each case, calculated using the    \n       volume-weighted average price of       \n       Company common stock of $96.9873 on    \n       January\u00a018, 2023, the                  \n  (a)  grant date).

Each NEO   \nreceives a base salary and is eligible to     \nreceive discretionary annual incentive        \ncompensation for prior year performance.      \nAnnual incentive compensation is intended to  \nreward NEOs for achievement of the Company\u2019s  \nfinancial and strategic objectives over the   \nprior year and is delivered in a mix of a cash\nbonus and deferred incentive compensation in  \nthe form of deferred equity. The amount of    \nincentive compensation that is deferred is    \nbased on a deferral table, which provides for \na more significant deferral at higher         \nincentive compensation levels. For 2022, the  \nCMDS Committee granted 100% of each NEO\u2019s     \ndeferred incentive compensation in equity-    \nbased RSUs and LTIP awards, aligning          \ncompensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. The\nLTIP awards, which are deferred equity awards \nthat are subject to future achievement of     \nspecified financial objectives over a three-  \nyear period, are described in more detail in

\nNEO\u2019s compensation to the Company\u2019s long-term \nfinancial performance and reinforce the NEO\u2019s \naccountability for the achievement of the     \nCompany\u2019s financial and strategic objectives  \nby directly linking the ultimate realizable   \naward value to prospective performance against\ncore financial measures over a three-year     \nperiod. GENERAL TERMS The 2023\u20132025 LTIP      \nawards will vest and convert to shares of the \nCompany\u2019s common stock at the end of the      \nthree-year performance period upon the        \nCompany\u2019s achievement of predetermined        \nperformance objectives with respect to the    \nCompany\u2019s average ROTCE and the Company\u2019s     \naverage ROTCE relative to the ROTCE of each   \nmember of a peer group, as set forth below,   \nover the period beginning on January 1, 2023  \nand ending on December 31, 2025. These        \nperformance objectives are consistent with,   \nand drive, Morgan Stanley\u2019s long-term         \nstrategy, reflective in the strategic         \nobjectives in Section 1.3 and the performance \npriorities in Section 3.1. While each         \nparticipant was awarded a target number of    \nperformance stock units, the actual number of \nunits earned could vary from zero, if         \nperformance objectives are not met, to up to  \n1.5 times target, if performance objectives   \nare meaningfully exceeded. No participant will\nreceive any portion of the LTIP award if the  \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \nThe LTIP awards remain subject to cancellation\nupon certain events until they are converted  \nto shares of Company common stock. If, after  \nconversion of the LTIP awards, the CMDS       \nCommittee determines that the performance     \ncertified by the CMDS Committee was based on  \nmaterially inaccurate financial statements,   \nthen the shares delivered will be subject to  \nclawback by the Company. LTIP awards are also \nsubject to any clawback policy adopted by the \nCompany from time to time, including to comply\nwith applicable rules and regulations         \n(including the Dodd-Frank Act and the         \nregulations and listing standards adopted     \nthereunder). PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES One-half  \nof the target LTIP award is earned based on   \nthe Company\u2019s average ROTCE over the three-   \nyear performance period (MS Average ROTCE).   \nThe other half of the target LTIP award is    \nearned based on the Company\u2019s average ROTCE   \nover the three-year performance period        \nrelative to the ROTCE of each member of a     \n                                         \n  70MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \npeer group (ROTCE Comparison Group) over the  \nsame three-year performance period (Relative  \nROTCE).

For 2022, \nthe CMDS Committee retained a special         \nindependent compensation consultant, Semler   \nBrossy, to assist the CMDS Committee in review\nand development of alternatives for a         \npotential redesign of the Company\u2019s LTIP      \nprogram. For grants beginning in 2023, the    \nCMDS Committee replaced the relative TSR      \nobjective included in prior year LTIP awards  \nwith an objective that measures Company ROTCE \nrelative to the ROTCE of each member of a peer\ngroup. This change ensures that the award     \ncontinues to be aligned with Company          \nperformance and strategic objectives, while   \nmaintaining strong alignment with shareholder \ninterests through the share-based nature of   \nthe award, as well as the time-vested deferred\nRSU award that each NEO also receives as part \nof total compensation. The CMDS Committee     \nreviews the structure and terms of the LTIP   \nprogram at least annually and considered      \nchanges to the LTIP program in consultation   \nwith its regular independent compensation     \nconsultant, Pay Governance, and its special   \nindependent compensation consultant, Semler   \nBrossy, over the course of multiple meetings  \nand also discussed the changes as part of the \nCompany\u2019s shareholder engagement. After       \nconsideration, the CMDS Committee determined  \nthat a relative ROTCE objective as compared to\na relative TSR objective (which could be      \nsubject to market variations and changes in   \nperformance of peer companies that are not    \ninfluenced by NEO performance) was better     \naligned with Company strategic objectives,    \ngiven that ROTCE is a key Company performance \npriority and that the significant proportion  \nof executive compensation awarded in the form \nof equity awards sufficiently aligns          \nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of           \nshareholders and motivates executives to work \nto achieve strong shareholder returns. In     \naddition, ROTCE is an objective financial     \nmeasure used as a performance criterion in    \nperformance equity programs of many of the    \nCompany\u2019s peers. As described in further      \ndetail in note 2 to the \u201c2022 Grants of Plan- \nBased Awards\u201d table, each of our NEOs received\nan LTIP award in 2022 on similar terms as     \ndescribed above, other than with respect to   \nthe use of a related TSR objective in lieu of \nthe relative ROTCE objective.                 \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT71  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThe CMDS Committee has consistently set       \nchallenging performance objectives for our    \nLTIP awards. The variability over time of the \npercentage of our LTIP awards that have been  \nearned demonstrates a strong pay-for-         \nperformance link. Since the inception of the  \nprogram in 2009, the average of the pay-outs  \nof all eleven LTIP awards up to and including \nthe 2020 LTIP awards is 107% of target. LTIP  \nPROGRAM PERFORMANCE As described in note 3 to \nthe \u201c2022 Stock Vested\u201d table, LTIP awards    \ngranted in 2020 (2020 LTIP award) vested at   \n150% of target, based on performance over the \nthree-year performance period ended December  \n31, 2022. 4.4 Additional Compensation         \nPractices ROBUST CLAWBACK POLICIES AND        \nPROCEDURES Throughout the year, employee      \nconduct matters are reviewed to determine     \nwhether they present situations that could    \nrequire clawback or cancellation of previously\nawarded compensation, as well as downward     \nadjustments to current-year compensation.     \nClawbacks of previously awarded compensation  \nare reviewed with the Employee Discipline     \nOversight Committee (a committee of senior    \nmanagement currently composed of the Chief    \nFinancial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief \nRisk Officer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Human\nResources Officer, and the Head of Non-       \nFinancial Risk) (EDOC) and reported to the    \nCMDS Committee. In addition, the Global       \nIncentive Compensation Discretion Policy      \nadopted by the CMDS Committee sets forth      \nstandards for managers on the use of          \ndiscretion when making annual compensation    \ndecisions and considerations for assessing    \nrisk management and outcomes. Further, the    \nCompany\u2019s control functions conduct a semi-   \nannual review of employee conduct with respect\nto risk and control matters, and are asked to \nidentify inappropriate behavior that may not  \nbe captured through other Company processes.  \nThe results of the reviews are reported to the\nEDOC and are reflected in performance feedback\nand considered in promotion and compensation  \ndecisions. The Company will review and revise \nits clawback policies to comply with the Dodd-\nFrank clawback requirements once the rule is  \nfinalized by the New York Stock Exchange. NO  \nCHANGE IN CONTROL TAX GROSS-UP PROTECTION NEOs\nare not contractually entitled to any golden  \nparachute excise tax protection upon a change \nin control of Morgan Stanley and are not      \nentitled to severance pay upon termination of \nemployment in excess of broad-based benefits. \nHEALTH AND INSURANCE BENEFITS All NEOs are    \neligible to participate in Company-sponsored  \nhealth and insurance benefit programs         \navailable in the relevant jurisdiction to     \nsimilarly situated employees.

The Company\u2019s Board-approved\npolicy authorizes the CEO to use the Company\u2019s\naircraft. As of January 1, 2010, Mr. Gorman   \nentered into a time-share agreement with the  \nCompany permitting him to reimburse the       \nCompany for the incremental cost of his       \npersonal use of the Company\u2019s aircraft. In    \n2021, for health and safety reasons, NEOs were\nauthorized to use the Company\u2019s aircraft and  \ncertain NEOs entered into time-share          \nagreements with the Company permitting them to\nreimburse the Company in part for their       \npersonal use of the Company\u2019s aircraft.       \nBeginning in 2022, the CEO again began        \nreimbursing the Company for the incremental   \ncost of his personal use of the Company\u2019s     \naircraft and other NEOs are generally not     \nauthorized to use the Company\u2019s aircraft for  \npersonal reasons unless they receive prior    \npermission from both the CEO and the Chief    \nLegal Officer and reimburse the Company for   \nthe incremental cost of their personal use of \nthe Company\u2019s aircraft in an amount not to    \nexceed permitted regulatory maximums.

Our     \nannual equity awards relating to performance  \nin a year are made shortly after year end.    \nTherefore, compensation in the table includes \nnot only non-equity compensation awarded for  \nservices in the applicable year but, in the   \ncase of stock awards granted in the years     \nreported in the table, compensation awarded   \nfor performance in prior years and forward-   \nlooking performance-vested compensation.

Effective after December 31, 2010, the  \nERP was frozen and no further benefit accruals\nwill occur. Benefits are generally payable as \nan annuity at age 65 (or earlier, subject to  \ncertain reductions in the amounts payable).   \nUnder the pre-2004 provisions of the ERP,     \nbenefits are payable in full at age 60 and    \nreduced 4% per year for retirement between    \nages 55 and 60 for employees who retire after \nage 55 with 10 years of service. Before the   \nERP was frozen, annual benefits were equal to \n1% of eligible earnings plus 0.5% of eligible \nearnings in excess of Social Security covered \ncompensation for each year of service.        \nEligible earnings generally included all      \ntaxable compensation, other than certain      \nequity-based and non-recurring amounts, up to \n$170,000 per year. ERP participants who, as of\nJanuary 1, 2004, had age plus service equal to\nat least 65 and who had been credited with    \nfive years of service, received benefits      \ndetermined under the ERP\u2019s pre-2004 benefit   \nformula, if greater.

MORGAN STANLEY COMPENSATION  \nINCENTIVE PLAN (MSCIP) Prior to 2020 year end,\na portion of a participant\u2019s year-end deferred\nincentive compensation may be granted under   \nMSCIP. Earnings on MSCIP awards are based on  \nthe performance of notional investments       \navailable under the plan and selected by the  \nparticipants. Participants may reallocate such\nbalances periodically, as determined by the   \nplan administrator. Until MSCIP awards reach  \ntheir scheduled distribution date, they are   \nsubject to cancellation and clawback by the   \nCompany. As of December 31, 2022, no NEO had  \nany outstanding MSCIP awards.                 \n                                         \n  82MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nPRE-TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM (PTIP) Under PTIP,  \nparticipants were permitted to defer a portion\nof their cash bonus or commissions for one or \nmore fiscal years. The plan has been closed to\nnew contributions since 2003. Earnings on PTIP\ncontributions are based on the performance of \nnotional investments available under the plan \nand selected by the participants. Participants\ncould generally elect the commencement date   \nfor distributions of their contributions and  \nearnings and the number of annual installments\nover which to receive distributions           \n(generally, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years). Subject to\nearlier distribution on death or termination  \nof employment due to disability, no           \ndistributions may begin prior to the          \nattainment of age 55 and prior to termination \nof employment. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUs)  \nRSUs are granted under the Morgan Stanley     \nEquity Incentive Compensation Plan or another \nCompany equity plan as determined by the CMDS \nCommittee. Each RSU constitutes a contingent  \nand unsecured promise of the Company to pay   \nthe holder one share of Company common stock  \non the conversion date of the RSU. The RSUs   \nincluded in this table are considered vested; \nhowever, the RSUs are subject to cancellation \nand clawback if a cancellation or clawback    \nevent occurs at any time prior to the         \nscheduled conversion date. The cancellation   \nand clawback events applicable to RSUs held by\nour NEOs are described in the CD&A and in     \n\u201cPotential Payments upon Termination or Change\nin Control.\u201d Potential Payments upon          \nTermination or Change in Control This section \ndescribes and quantifies the benefits and     \ncompensation to which each NEO would have been\nentitled under our existing plans and         \narrangements if the NEO\u2019s employment had      \nterminated or if the Company had undergone a  \nchange in control, in each case on December   \n31, 2022. 1. General Policies NO SPECIAL      \nSEVERANCE PAYMENTS Our NEOs would be entitled \nto a cash severance payment under the broad-  \nbased Morgan Stanley Severance Pay Plan       \n(Severance Plan) in connection with an        \ninvoluntary termination of employment other   \nthan for cause, subject to the NEO executing a\nrelease agreement in a form satisfactory to   \nthe Company, on the same basis as all other   \nemployees. The NEOs are not entitled to any   \nadditional or enhanced cash severance payments\nupon any termination of employment under the  \nSeverance Plan or otherwise, or to excise tax \nprotection upon a change in control of the    \nCompany. NO ENHANCED TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR  \nBENEFITS NEOs are entitled to receive post-   \ntermination benefits that are generally       \navailable to all salaried employees, such as  \ndeath, disability and post-retirement welfare \nbenefits, and are eligible for Company-paid   \nretiree medical coverage under the Morgan     \nStanley Grandfathered Retiree Medical Plan for\nthemselves and eligible dependents following  \nany termination of employment with three years\nof service. Following termination of          \nemployment, the NEOs are also entitled to     \namounts, to the extent vested, due under the  \nterms of our pension arrangements, as         \ndescribed under \u201c2022 Pension Benefits,\u201d and  \nour nonqualified deferred compensation plans, \nas described under \u201c2022 Nonqualified Deferred\nCompensation.\u201d Our NEOs are not entitled to   \nspecial or enhanced termination benefits under\nour pension and nonqualified deferred         \ncompensation plans as compared to other       \nemployees. CANCELLATION AND CLAWBACK OF       \nDEFERRED COMPENSATION Even if an NEO is       \nconsidered vested in a deferred incentive     \ncompensation award, the award may be subject  \nto cancellation through the distribution date \nin the event the NEO engages in a cancellation\nevent or if a clawback event occurs. In       \ngeneral, a cancellation event includes:       \nengaging in competitive activity during a     \nspecified period following a voluntary        \ntermination of employment; engaging in cause  \n(i.e., a breach of the NEO\u2019s obligation to the\nCompany, including a failure to comply with   \ninternal policies or compliance, ethics or    \nrisk management standards and failure or      \nrefusal to perform duties satisfactorily,     \nincluding supervisory and management duties); \nimproper disclosure of the Company\u2019s          \nproprietary information; solicitation of      \nCompany employees, clients or customers       \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT83  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nduring, and within a specified period         \nfollowing termination of, employment; the     \nmaking of unauthorized disclosures or         \ndisparaging or defamatory comments about the  \nCompany; resignation from employment without  \nproviding the Company proper advance notice;  \nor the failure to cooperate with or assist the\nCompany in connection with investigations,    \nregulatory matters, lawsuits or arbitrations  \nfollowing termination of employment. Clawback \nof deferred compensation awards by the Company\ncan be triggered through the applicable       \nscheduled distribution date if the NEO had    \nsignificant responsibility for a material     \nadverse outcome for the Company or any of its \nbusinesses or functions, even absent          \nmisconduct, or if the NEO\u2019s act or omission   \n(including with respect to direct supervisory \nresponsibilities) causes a restatement of the \nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial results,     \nviolates the Company\u2019s global risk management \nprinciples, policies and standards, or causes \na loss of revenue associated with a position  \non which the NEO was paid and the NEO operated\noutside of internal control policies.

Based on\nthis information, for 2022, the ratio of the  \nannual total compensation of the CEO to the   \nmedian of the annual total compensation of all\nother employees of the Company was 274 to 1.  \nTo identify the median of the annual total    \ncompensation of all employees of the Company, \nwe took the following steps:                  \n                                              \n      The pay ratio rule gives companies the  \n      ability to make the median employee     \n      determination only once every three     \n  1.  years, and we did                       \n      not make a new median employee          \n      determination for 2022. The median      \n      employee determination for 2020 is      \n      described below.                        \n                                              \n                                              \n     We measured the employee population of   \n     the Company as of December\u00a031, 2020 and  \n     included all employees of Morgan         \n     Stanley and its                          \n     consolidated subsidiaries globally.

Annual total      \n     reward consists of fixed compensation    \n     (e.g., base salary and allowances) and   \n     annual incentive compensation delivered  \n     in cash                                  \n     or equity and other variable             \n     compensation analogous to annual         \n     incentive compensation (e.g.,            \n     commissions). We annualized the          \n     compensation of all permanent employees  \n  \u2022  who were employed for less than the      \n     full fiscal year.

A\ndetailed discussion of the CMDS Committee\u2019s   \ndecisions regarding the compensation awarded  \nto the NEOs for 2022 performance can be found \nin the CD&A. PvP TABLE Pursuant to SEC rules, \nthe PvP Table is required to include for each \nyear \u201cCompensation Actually Paid\u201d (CAP) to the\nCEO and the average CAP to the non-CEO NEOs.  \nCAP is an SEC defined term that represents a  \nnew calculation of compensation that differs  \nfrom compensation paid during the year, as    \nwell as the Summary Compensation Table (SCT)  \ncalculation of compensation, as detailed in   \nfootnote 1 of this PvP Table, and the way in  \nwhich the CMDS Committee views annual         \ncompensation decisions, as discussed in       \nSection 4.1 of the CD&A. For example, the CAP \ncalculation for a given year includes the     \nchange in fair value of multiple years of     \nequity grants that are outstanding and        \nunvested during the year, or which vested     \nduring the year, whereas the SCT calculation  \nincludes only the fair value of equity awards \ngranted during the year. The CAP calculation  \nalso includes the value of dividend           \nequivalents accumulated on unvested equity    \nawards, whereas the SCT calculation does not. \nThese differences result in a CAP calculation \nthat is significantly impacted by changes in  \nstock price and other projected performance   \nresults and may be significantly higher or    \nlower than the corresponding SCT calculation. \nIt is also important to note that outstanding \nequity awards may be represented in more than \none year of the table, as demonstrated in the \nsupplemental table to footnote 1 to the PvP   \nTable. Equity grants (RSU and LTIP awards)    \nconstitute a meaningful portion of            \ncompensation for the CEO and other NEOs. The  \nvalue of equity grants will not be realized   \nbefore the scheduled payment date (generally  \nthree years from grant) and the ultimate value\nof such awards is subject to changes in stock \nprice. LTIP awards are further subject to the \nresults of pre-determined three-year          \nperformance objectives. LTIP awards are earned\nbased 50% on performance against Company ROE  \nor ROTCE goals and 50% on the Company\u2019s TSR   \nrelative to the TSR of the S&P 500 Financials \nSector Index. While each participant was      \nawarded a target number of LTIP performance   \nunits, the actual number of performance units \nearned could vary from zero up to 1.5 times   \ntarget, if performance objectives are         \nmeaningfully exceeded, and no participant will\nreceive any portion of the LTIP award if the  \nthreshold performance objectives are not met. \n(For a summary of historical LTIP program     \nperformance, see Section 4.3 of the CD&A.) In \naddition, equity awards are subject to        \ncancellation upon certain events before they  \nconvert to shares of Company common stock. The\nCEO and other NEOs are also subject to an     \nEquity Ownership Commitment and are not able  \nto sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all \nof the shares of Company common stock received\nupon conversion of equity awards (See         \n\u201cOwnership of our Stock \u2013 Executive Equity    \nOwnership Commitment\u201d).                       \n

As shown in the table below,  \nyear over year changes to the CAP to CEO and  \nthe Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs between 2020  \nand 2021 and between 2021 and 2022 generally  \ncorrelate to changes in the Company\u2019s         \ncumulative TSR (as calculated pursuant to SEC \nrules for the PvP table), Net Income and ROTCE\nfor the same periods. The Company delivered   \nstrong Net Income and ROTCE growth, and       \nsignificant stock appreciation and returns to \nshareholders, over these periods. The table   \nbelow shows that CEO and Average Non-CEO NEO  \ncompensation (as reported in SCT) changes were\nin line with changes in the Company\u2019s Net     \nIncome and ROTCE, while changes in the value  \nof the CAP to CEO and the Average CAP to Non- \nCEO NEOs were impacted by the following       \nfactors: dividends/change in pension value,   \nand changes in fair value of equity awards    \n(e.g., due to performance conditions of       \nperformance-based equity and share price).    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                               \n  (1)  As reported in the SCT  \n                               \n                                              \n       For 2021, also includes multiple RSU   \n  (2)  awards for one NEO that vested         \n       in 2021 due to achieving FCR           \n       eligibility                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  (3)  Value of initial fixed $100            \n       investment                             \n                                              \n                                \n  90MORGAN                      \n  STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n                        \n  Compensation Matters  \n                        \nThe correlation between changes in the CAP to \nCEO and the Average CAP to Non-CEO NEOs and   \nchanges in the Company\u2019s cumulative TSR, Net  \nIncome and ROTCE for the periods shown in the \ntable is due in part to the Company\u2019s use of  \nequity incentives that are directly tied to   \nstock price and, in particular, LTIP awards   \nthat are also directly tied to Company        \nfinancial performance and constitute a        \nsignificant portion of incentive compensation \nfor the CEO (60% for 2022) and non-CEO NEOs   \n(30% on average for 2022). Pursuant to SEC    \nrules, the CAP calculation for the fair value \nof unvested LTIP awards is based on the stock \nprice and the probable outcome of the         \nPerformance Conditions at the end of each year\nof the performance period. For LTIP awards    \nincluded in CAP, one half of the target award \nis earned based on the Company\u2019s average ROE  \nor ROTCE over the three-year performance      \nperiod; therefore, increases in Company       \nROE/ROTCE result in increases in CAP values   \nand decreases in Company ROE/ROTCE result in  \ndecreases in CAP values. Because the LTIP is  \nequity-based, increases in Company stock price\nresult in increases in TSR and increases in   \nCAP values and decreases in Company stock     \nprice result in decreases in TSR and decreases\nin CAP values. Unlike LTIP awards, RSUs do not\nsignificantly influence the correlations shown\nin the above table because, pursuant to SEC   \nrules, the CAP calculations for the fair value\nof unvested RSU awards are generally fixed at \nthe grant date fair value of the awards at the\nbeginning of each year due to FCR eligibility \nunder the award terms and deemed vesting at   \ngrant. The Company\u2019s ROTCE is a performance   \npriority that is used as a factor in          \ndetermining incentive compensation for the CEO\nand Non-CEO NEOs. The Company does not use Net\nIncome to determine compensation levels or    \nLTIP award pay-outs. The use of LTIP awards is\nalso responsible in part for the significant  \nvariation between the SCT and CAP values in   \nthe PvP Table. As described above, pursuant to\nSEC rules, the CAP calculation for the value  \nof unvested LTIP awards is based on the stock \nprice and the probable outcome of the         \nPerformance Conditions at the end of each year\nof the performance period and is reported for \neach year during which the award is           \noutstanding and unvested, whereas the SCT     \ncalculation for the unvested LTIP awards is   \nbased on the stock price on the grant date,   \nwhich is generally at the beginning of the    \nyear, and is reported only for the year during\nwhich the award is granted. This means that in\na year in which Company stock price improves, \nthe CAP amount will be outsized compared to   \nthe corresponding SCT amount. Further, because\nthe CEO receives a substantially larger       \nproportion of his compensation in LTIP awards \nas compared to the non-CEO NEOs, the          \nvariability for any given year between CAP to \nthe CEO and the SCT Total for the CEO is      \nlarger than the variability between CAP to    \nNon-CEO NEOs and the Average SCT Total for the\nNon-CEO NEOs. For example, for 2022, 40% of   \nthe CEO\u2019s equity incentives are earned based  \non ROTCE and on average 25% of the Non-CEO    \nNEOs\u2019 equity incentives are based on ROTCE,   \ntherefore, the impact of ROTCE on CAP to CEO \u2014\nboth positive and negative \u2014 is more          \npronounced as compared to the impact to the   \nAverage CAP to the Non-CEO NEOs. Commitment to\nEquitable Compensation Practices Attracting,  \nretaining and advancing under-represented     \ntalent is a priority for the Company, and a   \nkey aspect to this is ensuring that women and \nall other under-represented groups are        \nrewarded equitably. Morgan Stanley has robust \ncompensation practices that help ensure that  \ncompensation and reward decisions are made    \nfairly and consistently and are based on an   \nindividual\u2019s role, performance and experience.\nThe Company reviews compensation decisions for\nemployees on an ongoing basis, including at   \nthe point of hire as well as during our annual\ncompensation process, to help ensure that     \nindividual compensation decisions are in line \nwith this philosophy. A diverse workforce is  \nkey to our success, and consistent with that, \nwe are committed to continually assessing our \nrewards structure and decisions to help ensure\nequity in pay for all employees.              \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT91  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nOwnership of Our Stock Executive Equity       \nOwnership Commitment Members of the Company\u2019s \nOperating Committee are subject to an Equity  \nOwnership Commitment. The Equity Ownership    \nCommitment requires each of our CEO, CFO and  \nCo-Presidents (collectively, Covered Officers)\nto achieve ownership of a number of shares of \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to a specified multiple of his or her   \nbase salary within five years. Our CEO is     \nrequired to achieve ownership of shares of    \ncommon stock and equity awards with a value   \nequal to 10 times his base salary and each    \nother Covered Officer is required to achieve  \nownership of shares of common stock and equity\nawards with a value equal to six times his or \nher base salary. Unearned performance stock   \nunits are not counted for purposes of the     \nstock ownership requirement. In addition,     \nOperating Committee members (including all    \nexecutive officers) are required to retain    \ncommon stock and equity awards equal to a     \npercentage of common stock received from      \nequity awards (less allowances for the payment\nof any option exercise price and taxes)       \ngranted to them for service on the Operating  \nCommittee (Equity Award Shares, and such      \nservice, Covered Service) as follows:         \n                                              \n     Our CEO is required to retain 75% of     \n     Equity Award Shares acquired pursuant    \n     to equity awards granted in respect of   \n     any performance                          \n     year prior to and including the fifth    \n  \u2022  year of Covered Service as CEO and 50%   \n     of Equity Award Shares acquired          \n     pursuant to equity awards granted in     \n     respect of any performance year          \n     following the fifth year of Covered      \n     Service as CEO.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Each of our other Operating Committee    \n     members is required to retain 50% of     \n     Equity Award Shares acquired from        \n     equity awards granted                    \n     in respect of any performance year       \n     prior to and including the fifth year    \n     of Covered Service and 33% of Equity     \n  \u2022  Award Shares acquired pursuant to        \n     equity awards granted in respect of any  \n     performance year following the fifth     \n     year of Covered                          \n     Service; provided that Operating         \n     Committee members who are Covered        \n     Officers must retain 75% of all Equity   \n     Award Shares until the applicable        \n     ownership requirement is met.            \n                                              \nThis commitment ties a portion of our         \nOperating Committee members\u2019 net worth to the \nCompany\u2019s stock price and provides a          \ncontinuing incentive for them to work toward  \nsuperior long-term stock price performance.   \nExceptions to the Equity Ownership Commitment \nare subject to the approval of the CMDS       \nCommittee. None of our executive officers     \ncurrently have prearranged trading plans under\nSEC Rule 10b5-1. Director Equity Ownership    \nRequirement Our Corporate Governance Policies \nrequire each independent director to retain   \nownership of a number of shares of Morgan     \nStanley common stock and equity awards with a \nvalue equal to five times the annual cash     \nBoard retainer, and to retain 100% of his or  \nher Morgan Stanley stock unit awards (on an   \nafter-tax basis) until such ownership         \nrequirement is met. In addition, as discussed \nunder \u201cDirector Compensation,\u201d our independent\ndirectors generally receive an equity award   \nupon initial election to the Board and receive\nan annual equity award thereafter with a grant\ndate fair value of $260,000 (prorated in the  \ncase of the initial award) as part of their   \ndirector compensation. Fifty percent of each  \nequity award granted to our independent       \ndirectors does not become payable until the   \ndirector retires from the Board (and may be   \ndeferred beyond retirement at the director\u2019s  \nelection). We believe these equity ownership  \nopportunities and requirements enhance the    \nalignment of independent directors\u2019 interests \nwith the long-term interests of our           \nshareholders.

This\nnon-binding \u201cfrequency\u201d vote is required at   \nleast once every six years and will be held   \nagain at the Company\u2019s 2029 annual meeting of \nshareholders. After careful consideration, our\nBoard has determined that holding an annual   \nadvisory vote on executive compensation is the\nmost appropriate alternative for the Company  \nat this time, and recommends that you vote for\na one-year interval for the advisory vote on  \nexecutive compensation. While the Company\u2019s   \nexecutive compensation program is designed to \npromote a long-term connection between pay and\nperformance, our Board recognizes that an     \nannual advisory vote on executive compensation\nwill allow our shareholders to provide us     \nevery year with their view on our compensation\nphilosophy, policies and practices as         \ndisclosed annually in the proxy statement. We \nbelieve that an annual advisory vote on       \nexecutive compensation is consistent with our \npractice of seeking the views of, and engaging\nin discussions with, our shareholders on      \ncorporate governance matters and our executive\ncompensation philosophy, policies and         \npractices. You may cast your vote on your     \npreferred voting frequency by choosing the    \noption of one year, two years or three years  \nor you may abstain from voting. Because this  \nvote is advisory, the result will not be      \nbinding on the Board in any way, although the \nBoard will consider the outcome of the vote   \nand disclose its decision as to frequency by  \nfiling a Current Report on Form 8-K following \nthe 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. Our  \nBoard unanimously recommends that you vote for\nthe option of once every \u201c1 YEAR\u201das the       \nfrequency with which shareholders are provided\nan advisory vote on executive compensation.   \nProxies solicited by the Board will be voted  \nfor \u201c1 YEAR\u201dunless otherwise instructed.      \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT95  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                              \nShareholder Proposals The Company sets forth  \nbelow two shareholder proposals and the       \nproponents\u2019 supporting statements.

Proponent\u2019s  \nStatement Proposal 5 - Adopt Improved         \nShareholder Right to Call a Special           \nShareholder Meeting Shareholders ask our board\nto take the steps necessary to amend the      \nappropriate company governing documents to    \ngive the owners of a combined 10% of our      \noutstanding common stock the power to call a  \nspecial shareholder meeting. One of the main  \npurposes of this proposal is to give          \nshareholders who own Morgan Stanley stock in  \nstreet name the same right to formally        \nparticipate in calling for a special          \nshareholder meeting as non street name        \nshareholders and to clear up any ambiguity on \nthis right for street name shareholders in the\nclearest possible everyday language without   \ncumbersome addition steps to the fullest      \nextent possible. Currently it appears to take \nthe backing of 25% of the non street name     \nMorgan Stanley shareholders in order to call  \nfor a special shareholder meeting. All non    \nstreet name shareholders may be frozen out of \nthe shareholder right to call for a special   \nshareholder meeting. There is no reason to    \ngive a greater shareholder voice to non street\nname shareholders compared to other           \nshareholders. If street name shareholders are \nfrozen out, and if street name shareholders   \nown 50% of Morgan Stanly stock, it means that \n50% of the other shareholders would need to   \ntake the tedious steps to call for a special  \nshareholder meeting. It is highly unlikely    \nthat this would ever happen and thus a freeze \nout acts as a poison pill for a so-called     \nright of 25% of shares to call for a special  \nshareholder meeting. A realistic right for    \nshareholders to call for a special shareholder\nmeeting enables shareholders to replace poor  \nperforming directors without the need to wait \nuntil the next annual meeting. One of the main\npurposes of the right for shareholders to call\nfor a special shareholder meeting is to       \nimprove management engagement with            \nshareholders on important challenges facing   \nMorgan Stanley. If shareholders have a        \nrealistic right to call for a special         \nshareholder meeting, management will have more\nof an incentive to genuinely engage with      \nshareholders on matters of critical importance\nto Morgan Stanley.

Given   \n     the right of shareholders to call a      \n     special                                  \n     meeting that is already in place and     \n     that certain important matters must be   \n     submitted to shareholder vote, the       \n     Board does not believe that it is        \n     necessary or advisable to lower the      \n     threshold required to call a special     \n     meeting of                               \n     shareholders from 25% to 10%.            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Special meetings are costly,             \n     time-consuming and impose other          \n     significant burdens on the Company.The   \n     right to call special meetings is an     \n     important shareholder right in that it   \n     provides an avenue to resolve            \n     extraordinary matters that cannot wait   \n     until the next annual meeting to be      \n     addressed. However, planning for and     \n     conducting a                             \n     special meeting is an expensive and      \n     time-consuming undertaking. Our Board    \n     believes that allowing owners of at      \n     least 25% of our common stock to call a  \n     special meeting strikes the right        \n     balance between providing an important   \n     right to                                 \n     owners of a significant portion of our   \n     common stock, on the one hand, while     \n  \u2022  avoiding unnecessary, burdensome and     \n     costly special meetings called by a      \n     small minority of shareholders to        \n     advance their own interests, on the      \n     other hand.                              \n     Lowering the threshold in the Bylaws     \n     for shareholders to call a special       \n     meeting from 25% to 10% would be         \n     disruptive to our Company\u2019s operations,  \n     require significant attention from our   \n     Board and management and impose          \n     substantial                              \n     administrative and financial burdens on  \n     the Company. Specifically, our Board     \n     believes it is in the best interests of  \n     the Company and our shareholders to      \n     hold a special meeting only if           \n     requested by the owners of 25% of our    \n     common stock                             \n     because:                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Preparing for special meetings would     \n     require considerable attention from      \n  \u00b0  senior management,                       \n     diverting them from managing our         \n     operations and executing our business    \n     strategy.                                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Holding these special meetings also      \n     would require the preparation and        \n     distribution of proxy                    \n  \u00b0  materials, together with the             \n     solicitation and tabulation of votes,    \n     resulting in significant legal,          \n     printing and distribution costs for the  \n     Company.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n     Allowing any 10% holder(s) of our        \n     common stock to have an unlimited        \n     ability to call special meetings         \n     at any time and for any purpose would    \n  \u00b0  encourage them to use this costly        \n     mechanism to serve their narrow          \n     interests, without providing any         \n     corresponding benefit to Morgan Stanley  \n     and our shareholders as a whole.         \n                                              \nOur Board unanimously recommends that you vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201dthis proposal.

According to          \nscientific consensus, limiting warming to     \n1.5\u00b0C means that the world cannot develop new \noil and gas fields or coal mines beyond those \nalready approved (new fossil fuel exploration \nand development). 2Furthermore, existing      \nfossil fuel supplies are sufficient to satisfy\nglobal energy needs. 3New oil and gas fields  \nwould not produce in time to mitigate current \nenergy market turmoil resulting from the      \nUkraine War. 4 Morgan Stanley (MS) has        \ncommitted to align its financing with the     \ngoals of the Paris Agreement, 5achieving net- \nzero emissions by 2050, consistent with       \nlimiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. 6However,   \nMS\u2019 current policies and practices are not    \nnet-zero aligned. MS is among the world\u2019s     \nlargest funders of fossil fuels, providing    \n$137 billion in lending and underwriting to   \nfossil fuel companies during 2016-2021,       \nincluding $61 billion to 100 top companies    \nengaged in new fossil fuel exploration and    \ndevelopment. 7 Without a policy to phase out  \nfinancing of new fossil fuel exploration and  \ndevelopment, MS is unlikely to meet its       \nclimate commitments and merits scrutiny for   \nmaterial risks that may include:              \n                                              \n     Greenwashing: Banking and securities     \n     regulators are tightening and enforcing  \n  \u2022  greenwashing regulations, which could    \n     result in                                \n     major fines and settlements.8            \n                                              \n                                              \n     Regulation: Central banks, including     \n     the Fed, are starting to implement       \n  \u2022  climate stress tests9and scenario        \n     analyses,10and some have begun to        \n     propose increased capital requirements   \n     for banks\u2019 climate risks.11              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Competition: Dozens of global banks      \n  \u2022  have adopted policies to phase out       \n     financial support for new oil and gas    \n     fields12and coal mines.13                \n                                              \n                                              \n  1  https://www.swissre.com/media/press-re\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2022\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/res\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  5  https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  6  https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-bankin\u2026  \n                                              \n                                        \n  7  http://bankingonclimatechaos.org/  \n                                        \n                                              \n  8  https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  9  https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  10  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsev\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  11  https://www.bis.org/review/r220223e.h\u2026  \n                                              \n                                        \n  12  https://oilgaspolicytracker.org/  \n                                        \n                                   \n  13  https://coalpolicytool.org/  \n                                   \n                                         \n  MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT99  \n                                         \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                         \n  Shareholder Proposals  \n                         \n                                              \n     Reputation: Campaigns targeting MS\u2019      \n     climate policies include hundreds of     \n  \u2022  organizations with tens of millions of   \n     global                                   \n     members and supporters, including        \n     current and potential MS customers.14    \n                                              \nBy exacerbating climate change, MS is         \nincreasing systemic risk, which will have     \nsignificant negative impacts \u2014 including      \nphysical risks and transition risks 15\u2014 for   \nitself and for diversified investors.

RESOLVED: Shareholders request that  \nthe Board of Directors adopt a policy for a   \ntime-bound phase-out of MS\u2019 lending and       \nunderwriting to projects and companies        \nengaging in new fossil fuel exploration and   \ndevelopment. Supporting Statement: This       \nproposal is intended, in the discretion of    \nboard and management, to enable support for   \nMS\u2019 energy clients\u2019 low-carbon transition.    \nStatement of the Board Recommending a Vote    \nAgainst this Proposal A similar proposal      \nasking the Board to adopt a policy by the end \nof 2022 committing to proactive measures to   \nensure that the Company\u2019s lending and         \nunderwriting do not contribute to new fossil  \nfuel development was included in our 2022     \nproxy statement and received approximately    \n8.4% of the vote in favor. While there are    \nsome minor differences in this year\u2019s         \nproposal, the impact effectively remains the  \nsame in that it will impede our ability to    \nwork with oil and gas clients on their        \ntransition to a low-carbon economy \u2014 to the   \ndetriment of our clients, shareholders and the\nreal-economy. Morgan Stanley recognizes the   \nneed to balance the urgency for action on     \nclimate with the realities of the current     \nsocial, economic and geopolitical landscape.  \nMoreover, we have previously made a commitment\nto achieve Net-Zero financed emissions (Net-  \nZero), which we continue to support and work  \ntowards. The proposal does not take into      \naccount current geopolitical realities, and   \nthat the demand for fossil fuel production may\nnot decline as quickly and steadily as        \npreviously thought. Morgan Stanley believes   \nthat we need to have the flexibility to assist\nour clients and adopting an overly restrictive\npolicy would limit our ability to meet our    \nclients\u2019 needs. Accordingly, the Board        \nbelieves that this proposal is not in the best\ninterest of Morgan Stanley or its shareholders\nand clients and opposes this proposal for the \nreasons discussed below.                      \n                                              \n     Morgan Stanley continues to support the  \n     transition to a low-carbon economy. We   \n  \u2022  have already                             \n     committed to achieve Net-Zero by 2050,   \n     and have announced multiple commitments  \n     to help facilitate this transition.      \n                                              \n                                              \n     In 2020, we were the first major U.S.    \n  \u00b0  headquartered global financial services  \n     firm to commit to                        \n     achieve Net-Zero by 2050.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     In 2021, we publicly announced our 2030  \n     interim financed emissions targets for   \n     the auto manufacturing, energy and       \n     power sectors, which we identified as    \n     the most emissions-intensive sectors in  \n     our corporate lending portfolio.Our      \n     reduction targets, which cover client    \n     Scope                                    \n     1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions and     \n  \u00b0  all greenhouse gases, cover our          \n     corporate lending portfolio.

A         \n     significant mismatch in supply and       \n     demand in the short-term could           \n     contribute to price spikes and a         \n     disorderly transition, which could       \n     undermine support to address climate     \n     change.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Less ability to forge long-term          \n  \u00b0  partnerships with companies pursuing     \n     low-carbon                               \n     opportunities.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n     The transition to a low-carbon economy   \n     may pose various challenges and          \n     opportunities to different companies.    \n  \u2022  Such opportunities may                   \n     present themselves over a long           \n     timeline, and as noted above, may        \n     require financing in both the near- and  \n     long-term.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n     These opportunities include transition   \n     to low-carbon energy development,        \n     electrification of upstream operations   \n     and investment in                        \n     assets that reduce emissions.            \n     Fossil-fuel clients that seek financial  \n  \u2022  solutions to implement these changes     \n     present opportunities for partnership    \n     with our firm in multiple alternative    \n     ways that support the transition to a    \n     low-carbon                               \n     economy, to the benefit of Morgan        \n     Stanley and our shareholders, as well    \n     as the climate.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     As noted above, Morgan Stanley is        \n     well-positioned to partner with and      \n     advise these clients in seizing          \n  \u2022  opportunities to reduce                  \n     emissions. By forcing us to choose a     \n     date after which we must stop these      \n     relationships, the proposal impedes our  \n     ability to assist with this process.     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u00b0  Less ability to tailor our engagement    \n     to the needs of individual companies.    \n                                              \n                                              \n     The proposal deprives us of the          \n     flexibility to consider the diverse      \n     nature, businesses and regulatory        \n     circumstances of our oil and             \n  \u2022  gas clients within the United States     \n     and globally, as well as the best        \n     decarbonization strategy for these       \n     clients in the face of geopolitical      \n     events, changing market conditions, and  \n     quickly evolving climate technology.     \n                                              \n                                          \n  102MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                         \n  Shareholder Proposals  \n                         \n                                              \n     In addition, the proposal does not take  \n     into account the relative amount of new  \n     fossil fuel exploration and development  \n     performed                                \n  \u2022  by a client.

If you hold shares     \nthrough a broker, follow the voting           \ninstructions you receive from your broker. If \nyou do not submit voting instructions to your \nbroker, your broker may still be permitted to \nvote your shares in certain cases.

If you hold shares as a      \nrecord shareholder, you may have your shares  \nvoted by submitting a proxy for your shares by\nmail, telephone or the Internet as described  \non the proxy card. If you submit your proxy   \nvia the Internet, you may incur Internet      \naccess charges. Submitting your proxy will not\nlimit your right to vote at the annual        \nmeeting. A properly completed and submitted   \nproxy will be voted in accordance with your   \ninstructions, unless you subsequently revoke  \nyour proxy in accordance with the procedures  \ndescribed below (see \u201cHow Can I Revoke My     \nProxy?\u201d). If you submit a signed proxy card   \nwithout indicating your voting instructions,  \nthe person voting the proxy will vote your    \nshares according to the Board\u2019s               \nrecommendations. How Do I Submit Voting       \nInstructions for Shares Held in Employee      \nPlans? If you hold shares in, or have been    \nawarded stock units under, certain employee   \nplans, you will separately receive directions \non how to submit your voting instructions.    \nShares held in the following employee plans   \nalso are subject to the following rules:      \n401(k) Plan. The Northern Trust Company       \n(Northern Trust), the 401(k) Plan\u2019s trustee,  \nmust receive your voting instructions for the \ncommon stock held on your behalf in the 401(k)\nPlan on or before May 16, 2023. If Northern   \nTrust does not receive your voting            \ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares together with other unvoted, forfeited \nand unallocated shares in the 401(k) Plan in  \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives from other participants in   \nthe 401(k) Plan. On March 20, 2023, there were\n28,781,109 shares in the 401(k) Plan. Other   \nEquity-Based Plans. State Street Global       \nAdvisors Trust Company acts as trustee for the\nTrust that holds shares of common stock       \nunderlying stock units awarded to employees   \nunder several of Morgan Stanley\u2019s equity-based\nplans. Employees allocated shares held in the \nTrust must submit their voting instructions   \nfor receipt by the trustee on or before May   \n16, 2023. If the trustee does not receive your\ninstructions by that date, it will vote such  \nshares, together with shares held in the Trust\nthat are unallocated or held on behalf of     \nformer Morgan Stanley employees and employees \nin certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., in \nthe same proportion as the voting instructions\nthat it receives for shares held in the Trust \nin connection with such plans. On March 20,   \n2023, 61,646,399 shares were held in the Trust\nin connection with such plans.                \n                                          \n  106MORGAN STANLEY 2023 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                          \nTABLE OF CONTENTS                             \n                                        \n  Information About the Annual Meeting  \n                                        \nHow Can I Revoke My Proxy? You can revoke your\nproxy at any time before your shares are voted\nby (1) delivering a written revocation notice \nprior to the annual meeting to Martin M.      \nCohen, Corporate Secretary, Morgan Stanley,   \n1585 Broadway, Suite C, New York, New York    \n10036; (2) submitting a later dated proxy that\nwe receive no later than when the polls close \nduring the annual meeting; or (3) voting at   \nthe annual meeting. Attending the annual      \nmeeting does not revoke your proxy unless you \nvote at the meeting. Why Did I Receive a One- \nPage Notice Regarding the Internet            \nAvailability of Proxy Materials? Pursuant to  \nSEC rules, we are mailing to certain of our   \nshareholders a Notice about the availability  \nof proxy materials on the Internet instead of \npaper copies of the proxy materials. This     \nprocess allows us to expedite our             \nshareholders\u2019 receipt of proxy materials,     \nlower the costs of distribution and reduce the\nenvironmental impact of our annual meeting.   \nAll shareholders receiving the Notice will    \nhave the ability to access the proxy materials\nand submit a proxy over the Internet. It is   \nimportant that you submit your proxy to have  \nyour shares voted. Instructions on how to     \naccess the proxy materials over the Internet  \nor to request a paper copy of the proxy       \nmaterials may be found in the Notice. The     \nNotice is not a proxy card and cannot be      \nreturned to submit your vote. You must follow \nthe instructions on the Notice to submit your \nproxy to have your shares voted. Other        \nBusiness We do not know of any other matters  \nthat may be presented for action at the       \nmeeting other than those described in this    \nproxy statement. If any other matter is       \nproperly brought before the meeting, the proxy\nholders will vote on such matter in their     \ndiscretion as permitted under SEC rules. How  \nCan I Submit a Shareholder Proposal or        \nNominate a Director for the 2024 Annual       \nMeeting?
