Current Report on Form 8-K Item 8.01 Other\nEvents. As part of its previously disclosed strategic review, on\nJanuary 11, 2022, Citigroup Inc. (Citi) announced that it\nintends to exit the consumer, small business and middle market\nbanking operations of Citibanamex, which would advance Citi \u2019s\nstrategic goals to invest in businesses aligned with Citi \u2019s\ncore strengths, simplify its operations and drive long-term\nshareholder value. The businesses in the intended exit include\nthe Mexico consumer and small business banking operations,\nreported as part of Citi \u2019s Global Consumer Bankingsegment, as\nwell as the Mexico middle market banking business, reported in\nCiti \u2019s Institutional Clients Groupsegment.

Citi will continue to operate a locally-licensed\nbanking business in Mexico through its global Institutional\nClients Group, which remains important to Citi \u2019s global\nnetwork. The method and timing of Citi \u2019s exit from its\nconsumer, small business and middle market banking operations in\nMexico, which could include a sale or a public market\nalternative, will be determined by Citi and will be aligned with\nits objectives of maximizing shareholder value and strengthening\nboth the businesses that Citi will exit and those it will\nretain.
