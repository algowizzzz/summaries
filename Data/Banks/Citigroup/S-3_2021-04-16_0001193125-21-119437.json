For more information, see \u0093Citigroup Inc.\u0094\nbelow. Debt Securities Debt securities are unsecured general\nobligations of Citigroup in the form of senior or subordinated\ndebt. Senior debt includes Citigroup\u0092s notes, debt and\nguarantees and any other debt for money borrowed that is not\nsubordinated. Subordinated debt, so designated at the time it\nis issued, would not be entitled to interest and principal\npayments if interest and principal payments on the senior debt\nwere not made. The senior and subordinated debt will be issued\nunder separate indentures between Citigroup and a trustee.\nBelow are summaries of the general features of the debt\nsecurities from these indentures, unless otherwise specified\nin connection with a particular offering. For a more detailed\ndescription of these features, see \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0094 below.

If any of these events occur with        \n      another company, the other company generally would be     \n      required to assume Citigroup\u0092s responsibilities for the    \n      debt. Unless the transaction                              \n      resulted in a default, Citigroup would be released from   \n      all liabilities and obligations under the debt            \n      securities when the other company assumed its             \n      responsibilities.                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      The indentures provide that holders of a majority of the  \n      total principal amount of the senior debt securities      \n      outstanding in any series and holders of a majority of    \n      the total principal amount of the subordinated debt       \n      securities outstanding in any series that, in each case,  \n      are affected by such change, may vote to change           \n      Citigroup\u0092s obligations or your                            \n      rights concerning those securities. However, changes to   \n      the financial terms of that security, including changes   \n      in the payment of principal or interest on that security  \n      or, except in certain circumstances, the currency of      \n      payment, cannot be made                                   \n      unless every holder affected consents to the change.      \n                                                                \n2\n                                                                \n      Citigroup may satisfy its obligations under the debt      \n      securities or be released from its obligation to comply   \n      with                                                      \n      certain limitations at any time by depositing sufficient  \n      amounts of cash and/or government securities with the     \n      trustee to pay Citigroup\u0092s obligations under the           \n      particular securities when due.                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      The indentures govern the actions of the trustee with     \n      regard to the debt securities, including when the         \n      trustee                                                   \n      is required to give notices to holders of the securities  \n      and when lost or stolen debt securities may be replaced.  \n                                                                \nEvents of Default and Defaults Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of senior debt, the only\nevents of default specified in the senior debt indenture are:\n                                                                \n      failure to pay principal or required interest for 30      \n      days after it is due; and                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      certain events of insolvency or bankruptcy, whether       \n      voluntary or not.                                         \n                                                                \nOnly these events of default provide for a right of\nacceleration of the senior debt securities. No other event,\nincluding a default in the performance of any other covenant\nof Citigroup in the senior indenture or any other default that\nis not also an event of default, will result in acceleration.\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of subordinated debt, the only events of default\nspecified in the subordinated debt indenture are certain\nevents of insolvency or bankruptcy, whether voluntary or not.\nOnly these events of default provide for a right of\nacceleration of the subordinated debt securities. No other\nevent, including a default in the payment of principal of,\npremium, if any, or interest on, subordinated debt securities,\nthe performance of any other covenant of Citigroup in the\nsubordinated indenture or any other default that is not also\nan event of default, will result in acceleration. Remedies\nSenior Indenture: If there were an event of default, the\ntrustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount of senior\ndebt securities outstanding in a series could demand that the\nprincipal be paid immediately. However, holders of a majority\nin principal amount of the securities in that series could\nrescind that acceleration of the debt securities. The\noccurrence of a default for any reason other than (i)\nnonpayment of principal or interest that has continued for 30\ndays or (ii) certain events of insolvency or bankruptcy will\nnot give the trustee or such holders the right to demand that\nthe principal of the senior debt securities be paid\nimmediately. Subordinated Indenture: If there were an event of\ndefault, the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal amount\nof subordinated debt securities outstanding in a series could\ndemand that the principal be paid immediately. However,\nholders of a majority in principal amount of the securities in\nthat series may rescind that acceleration of the debt\nsecurities. The occurrence of a default for any reason other\nthan certain events of insolvency or bankruptcy will not give\nthe trustee or such holders the right to demand that the\nprincipal of the subordinated debt securities be paid\nimmediately. TLAC Eligibility Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities, the\ndebt securities are intended to qualify as eligible long-term\ndebt for purposes of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System\u0092s total loss-absorbing capacity (\u0093TLAC\u0094) rule.\nAs a result, in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy or other\nresolution proceeding, Citigroup\u0092s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on\nCitigroup\u0092s shareholders and then on its unsecured creditors,\nincluding the holders of the debt securities. Further, in a\nbankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup, any\nvalue realized by holders of the debt securities\n\n3\n\nmay not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed on the debt\nsecurities. For more information about the final TLAC rule and\nits consequences for the debt securities, you should refer to\nthe\nsections \u0093Managing Global Risk \u0097 Liquidity Risk \u0097 Long-Term\nDebt \u0097 Resolution Plan\u0094 and \u0093 \u0097 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity\n(TLAC)\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCommon Stock Warrants\n\nCitigroup may issue common stock warrants and will do so under\na separate common stock warrant agreement between Citigroup\nand a bank or trust\ncompany. You are encouraged to read the standard form of the\ncommon stock warrant agreement, which will be filed as an\nexhibit to one of Citigroup\u0092s future current reports and\nincorporated by reference in its registration statement of\nwhich\nthis prospectus forms a part. You can receive copies of these\ndocuments by following the directions beginning on page 7.\n\nCommon stock\nwarrants are securities pursuant to which Citigroup may sell\nor purchase common stock. The particular terms of each issue\nof common stock warrants, the common stock warrant agreement\nrelating to the common stock warrants and the common stock\nwarrant\ncertificates representing common stock warrants will be\ndescribed in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIndex Warrants\n\nCitigroup may issue index warrants and will do so under a\nseparate index warrant agreement between Citigroup and a bank\nor trust company. You\nare encouraged to read the standard form of the index warrant\nagreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to one of\nCitigroup\u0092s future current reports and incorporated by\nreference in its registration statement of which this\nprospectus forms a\npart. You can receive copies of these documents by following\nthe directions beginning on page 7.\n\nIndex warrants are securities that, when\nproperly exercised by the purchaser, entitle the purchaser to\nreceive from Citigroup an amount in cash or a number of\nsecurities that will be indexed to prices, yields, or other\nspecified measures or changes in an index or differences\nbetween two or\nmore indices.\n\nThe prospectus supplement for a series of index warrants will\ndescribe the formula for determining the amount in cash or\nnumber of securities, if any, that Citigroup will pay you when\nyou exercise an index warrant and will contain information\nabout the relevant underlying assets and other specific terms\nof the index warrant.\n\nCitigroup will generally issue index warrants in book-entry\nform, which means that they will not be evidenced by physical\ncertificates. Also,\nCitigroup will generally list index warrants for trading on a\nnational securities exchange, such as the New York Stock\nExchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094), NYSE Arca, the NASDAQ Global Market or the\nChicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nThe index warrant agreement for any series of index warrants\nwill provide that holders of a majority of the total principal\namount of the\nindex warrants outstanding in any series may vote to change\ntheir rights concerning those index warrants. However, changes\nto fundamental terms such as the amount or manner of payment\non an index warrant or changes to the exercise times cannot be\nmade unless every holder affected consents to the change.\n\nAny prospective purchasers of index warrants should be aware\nof special United\nStates federal income tax considerations applicable to\ninstruments such as the index warrants. The prospectus\nsupplement relating to each series of index warrants will\ndescribe the important tax considerations.\n\n4\n\nPreferred Stock Citigroup may issue preferred stock with\nvarious terms to be established by its board of directors or a\ncommittee designated by the board. Each series of preferred\nstock will be more fully described in the particular\nprospectus supplement that will accompany this prospectus,\nincluding redemption provisions, rights in the event of\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up of Citigroup, voting\nrights and conversion rights. Generally, each series of\npreferred stock will rank on an equal basis with each other\nseries of preferred stock and will rank prior to Citigroup\u0092s\ncommon stock. The prospectus supplement will also describe how\nand when dividends will be paid on the series of preferred\nstock. Depositary Shares Citigroup may issue depositary shares\nrepresenting fractional shares of preferred stock. Each\nparticular series of depositary shares will be more fully\ndescribed in the prospectus supplement that will accompany\nthis prospectus. These depositary shares will be evidenced by\ndepositary receipts and issued under a deposit agreement\nbetween Citigroup and a bank or trust company. You are\nencouraged to read the standard form of the deposit agreement,\nwhich is incorporated by reference in Citigroup\u0092s registration\nstatement of which this prospectus forms a part. Stock\nPurchase Contracts and Stock Purchase Units Citigroup may\nissue stock purchase contracts, including contracts obligating\nholders to purchase from or sell to Citigroup, and Citigroup\nto sell to or purchase from the holders, a specified number of\nshares of common stock, shares of preferred stock or\ndepositary shares at a future date or dates. The stock\npurchase contracts may be issued separately or as part of\nstock purchase units, consisting of a stock purchase contract\nand any combination of debt securities, capital securities,\njunior subordinated debt securities or debt obligations of\nthird parties, including U.S. Treasury securities. The\napplicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of\nthe stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units,\nincluding, if applicable, collateral or depositary\narrangements. Common Stock Citigroup may issue common stock,\npar value $0.01 per share. Holders of common stock are\nentitled to receive dividends when declared by Citigroup\u0092s\nboard of directors. Each holder of common stock is entitled to\none vote per share. The holders of common stock have no\npreemptive rights or cumulative voting rights. Use of Proceeds\nCitigroup will use the net proceeds it receives from any\noffering of these securities for general corporate purposes,\nwhich may include funding its operating units and\nsubsidiaries, financing possible acquisitions or business\nexpansion and refinancing or extending the maturity of\nexisting debt obligations. Citigroup may use a portion of the\nproceeds from the sale of index warrants and indexed notes to\nhedge its exposure to payments that it may have to make on\nsuch index warrants and indexed notes as described below under\n\u0093Use of Proceeds and Hedging.\u0094 Plan of Distribution Citigroup\nmay sell the offered securities in any of the following ways:\n                                              \n      to or through underwriters or dealers;  \n                                              \n5\n                           \n      by itself directly;  \n                           \n                          \n      through agents; or  \n                          \n                                                              \n      through a combination of any of these methods of sale.  \n                                                              \nThe prospectus supplement will explain the ways Citigroup\nsells specific securities, including the names of any\nunderwriters and details of the pricing of the securities, as\nwell as the commissions, concessions or discounts Citigroup is\ngranting the underwriters, dealers or agents. If Citigroup\nuses underwriters in any sale, the underwriters will buy the\nsecurities for their own account and may resell the securities\nfrom time to time in one or more transactions, at a fixed\npublic offering price or at varying prices determined at the\ntime of sale. In connection with an offering, underwriters and\nselling group members and their affiliates may engage in\ntransactions to stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the\nmarket price of the securities, in accordance with applicable\nlaw. Citigroup expects that the underwriters for any offering\nwill include one or more of its broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nincluding Citigroup Global Markets Inc. These broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries also expect to offer and sell previously issued\nsecurities as part of their business, and may act as a\nprincipal or agent in such transactions. Citigroup or any of\nits subsidiaries may use this prospectus and the related\nprospectus supplements and pricing supplements in connection\nwith these activities. Offerings in which Citigroup\u0092s broker-\ndealer subsidiaries participate will conform with the\nrequirements set forth in Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. addressing conflicts of interest\nwhen distributing the securities of an affiliate. See below\nunder \u0093Plan of Distribution.\u0094 Where You Can Find More\nInformation As required by the Securities Act of 1933,\nCitigroup filed a registration statement relating to the\nsecurities offered by this prospectus with the Securities and\nExchange Commission.

Generally, forward-looking statements are\nnot based on historical facts but instead represent\nCitigroup\u0092s and its management\u0092s beliefs regarding future\nevents. Such statements may be identified by words such as\nbelieve, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase,\nmay fluctuate, targetandillustrative,and\nsimilar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as\nwill, should, wouldand could.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u0092s current expectations and are subject to risks,\nuncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results and\ncapital and other financial conditions may differ materially\nfrom those included in these statements due to a variety of\nfactors, including without limitation the precautionary\nstatements included in this prospectus and any accompanying\nprospectus supplement, and the factors and uncertainties\nsummarized under \u0093Forward-Looking Statements\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s\nmost recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and the factors listed and described under \u0093Risk\nFactors\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s most\nrecent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q. Precautionary statements included in such filings should\nbe read in conjunction with this prospectus\nand any accompanying prospectus supplement. Any forward-\nlooking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak\nonly as to the date they are made, and Citigroup does not\nundertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the\nimpact of\ncircumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-\nlooking statements were made.\n\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO FLOATING RATE DEBT SECURITIES\n\nCompounded SOFR is a daily compounded rate that is relatively\nnew in the marketplace.\n\nCitigroup may issue floating rate notes linked to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u0093SOFR\u0094). Additionally, under the\nbenchmark\ntransition provisions of London Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u0093LIBOR\u0094) linked floating rate notes, if a Benchmark\nTransition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date\noccur with respect to LIBOR, then the rate of interest on such\nLIBOR-linked floating rate notes will be determined using SOFR\n(unless a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark\nReplacement Date also occur with respect to the Benchmark\nReplacements that are linked to SOFR, in which case the rate\nof\ninterest will be based on the next-available Benchmark\nReplacement). In the following discussion of SOFR, a reference\nto SOFR-linked notes means floating rate notes at any time\nwhen the rate of interest on those notes is or will be\ndetermined based\non SOFR.\n\nThe interest rate on such notes will be based on a formula\nused to calculate a daily compounded SOFR rate or will be\ncalculated\nusing the SOFR Index, as applicable, both of which are\nrelatively new in the market. This interest rate for SOFR-\nlinked notes will not be SOFR published on or in respect of a\nparticular date during such interest or observation period or\nan average\nof SOFR during such period. Accordingly, the interest rate on\nSOFR-linked notes will differ from the interest rate on other\ninvestments linked to SOFR that use an alternative basis to\ndetermine the applicable interest rate. Also, if the SOFR rate\nfor a particular day during an observation or interest period\nis negative, the amount of interest attributable to that day\nmay be less than zero; provided that in no event will the\ninterest payable on a SOFR-linked note for any interest\nperiod be less than zero.\n\nLimited market precedent exists for securities that use SOFR\nas the interest rate, and the method for\ncalculating an interest rate based upon SOFR in those\nprecedents varies. Accordingly, the specific formula for\nCompounded SOFR or the SOFR Index used for determining the\ninterest due on the SOFR-linked notes may not be widely\nadopted by other market\nparticipants, if at all. If the market adopts a calculation\nmethod that differs from that for the SOFR-linked notes, the\nreturn on, value of and market for such floating rate notes\ncould be adversely affected.\n\n8\n\nAny failure of SOFR to gain market acceptance could adversely\naffect holders of the SOFR-linked notes.\n\nSOFR may fail to gain market acceptance. SOFR was developed\nfor use in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial\ncontracts\nas an alternative to the London interbank offered rate for\nU.S. dollar obligations (\u0093U.S. dollar LIBOR\u0094) in part because\nit is considered to be a good representation of general\nfunding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury repo market.\nHowever, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S.\nTreasury securities, it does not measure bank-specific credit\nrisk and, as a result, is less likely to correlate with the\nunsecured short-term funding costs of banks. This may mean\nthat market\nparticipants would not consider SOFR to be a suitable\nsubstitute or successor for all of the purposes for which U.S.\ndollar LIBOR historically has been used (including, without\nlimitation, as a representation of the unsecured short-term\nfunding\ncosts of banks), which may, in turn, lessen its market\nacceptance. Any failure of SOFR to gain market acceptance\ncould adversely affect the return on, value of and market for\nthe SOFR-linked notes.\n\nAny market for SOFR-linked notes may be illiquid or\nunpredictable.\n\nSOFR-linked notes will likely have no established trading\nmarket when issued, and an established trading market for the\nSOFR-linked notes may\nnever develop or may not be very liquid. Market terms for\nsecurities that are linked to SOFR may evolve over time, and\nas a result, trading prices of the SOFR-linked notes may be\nlower than those of later-issued securities that are linked to\nSOFR.\nSimilarly, if SOFR does not prove to be widely used in\nsecurities that are similar or comparable to the SOFR-linked\nnotes, the trading price of the SOFR-linked notes may be lower\nthan those of securities that are linked to rates that are\nmore widely\nused. You may not be able to sell your SOFR-linked notes at\nall or may not be able to sell the SOFR-linked notes at prices\nthat will provide you with a yield comparable to similar\ninvestments that have a developed secondary market, and\nconsequently,\nyou may suffer from increased pricing volatility and market\nrisk.\n\nThe manner of adoption or application of reference rates based\non SOFR\nin the bond market may differ materially compared with the\napplication and adoption of SOFR in other markets, such as the\nderivatives and loan markets. You should carefully consider\nhow any potential inconsistencies between the adoption of\nreference\nrates based on SOFR across these markets may impact any\nhedging or other financial arrangements which you may put in\nplace in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposal\nof the SOFR-linked notes.\n\nYou should not rely on indicative or historical data\nconcerning the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\u0093NY Federal Reserve\u0094)\nstarted publishing SOFR in April 2018 and has also started\npublishing\nhistorical indicative SOFR dating back to 2014, although such\nhistorical indicative data inherently involves assumptions,\nestimates and approximations. You should not rely on such\nhistorical indicative data or on any historical changes or\ntrends in\nSOFR as an indicator of the future performance of SOFR. Since\nthe initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate\nhave, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in\ncomparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may\nbear\nlittle or no relation to the historical actual or historical\nindicative data. In addition, the return on and value of the\nSOFR-linked notes may fluctuate more than floating rate\nsecurities that are linked to less volatile rates.\n\nChanges in SOFR could adversely affect holders of the SOFR-\nlinked notes.\n\nBecause SOFR is published by the NY Federal Reserve based on\ndata received from other sources, Citigroup has no control\nover its determination,\ncalculation or publication. There can be no assurance that\nSOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a\nmanner that is materially adverse to the interests of\ninvestors in the SOFR-linked notes. If the manner in which\nSOFR is\ncalculated is changed, that change may result in a reduction\nin the amount of interest that accrues on the SOFR-linked\nnotes, which may adversely affect the trading prices of the\nSOFR-linked notes. In addition, the interest rate on the SOFR-\nlinked\nnotes for any day will not be adjusted for any modification or\namendment to SOFR for that day that NY Federal Reserve may\npublish if the interest rate for that day has already been\ndetermined prior to such publication. Further, if the interest\nrate\non the SOFR-linked notes for any interest period declines to\nzero or becomes negative, no interest will accrue on the SOFR-\nlinked notes with respect to that interest period.\n\n9\n\nWith respect to SOFR Index notes, implementation of use of the\nSOFR Index or increased regulatory\nscrutiny of such SOFR Index could increase the costs and risks\nof administering such SOFR Index and complying with any such\nregulations or requirements. These factors may have the effect\nof discouraging market participants from continuing to\nadminister the SOFR Index, trigger changes in the rules or\nmethodologies used in the SOFR Index or lead to the\ndiscontinuance or unavailability of the SOFR Index.\n\nThe total amount of interest payable with respect to each\ninterest period for SOFR-linked notes will not be known until\nnear the end of the interest period.\n\nThe total amount of interest payable with respect to each\ninterest period for a SOFR-linked note will not be known until\nnear\nthe end of such interest period. As a result you will not know\nthe total amount of interest payable with respect to each such\ninterest period until shortly prior to the related interest\npayment date and it may be difficult for you to reliably\nestimate the amount of interest that will be payable on each\nsuch interest payment date.\n\nAny Benchmark Replacement may not be the economic equivalent\nof Compounded SOFR.\n\nUnder the benchmark transition provisions of the SOFR-linked\nnotes, if Citigroup (or its affiliate) determines\nthat a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred with respect to SOFR, then the\ninterest rate on the SOFR-linked notes will be determined\nusing the next available Benchmark Replacement (which may\ninclude a\nrelated Benchmark Replacement Adjustment). However, there is\nno assurance that the characteristics of the Benchmark\nReplacement will be similar to SOFR or the then-current\nBenchmark that it is replacing and the Benchmark Replacement\nmay not be the\neconomic equivalent of Compounded SOFR or the then-current\nBenchmark that it is replacing. Further, the ISDA Fallback\nRate, which is another Benchmark Replacement, may change over\ntime.\n\nIn addition, (i) any failure of the Benchmark Replacement to\ngain market acceptance could adversely affect the floating\nrate notes,\n(ii) the Benchmark Replacement may have a very limited history\nand the future performance of the Benchmark Replacement may\nnot be predicted based on historical performance, (iii) the\nsecondary trading market for floating rate notes based\non the Benchmark Replacement may be limited and (iv) the\nadministrator of the Benchmark Replacement may make changes\nthat could change the value of the Benchmark Replacement or\ndiscontinue the Benchmark Replacement and has no obligation to\nconsider your interests in doing so.\n\nThe implementation of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes\ncould adversely affect holders of SOFR-linked notes.\n\nUnder the benchmark transition provisions of the SOFR-linked\nnotes, if a particular Benchmark Replacement or Benchmark\nReplacement Adjustment cannot be determined, then the next-\navailable Benchmark Replacement or Benchmark Replacement\nAdjustment will apply. These replacement rates and adjustments\nmay be selected or formulated by (i) the Relevant Governmental\nBody (such as the ARRC), (ii) ISDA or (iii) in certain\ncircumstances, Citigroup (or its affiliate). In addition, the\nbenchmark transition provisions expressly authorize Citigroup\n(or its affiliate) to make certain changes, which are defined\nas\n\u0093Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes,\u0094 with respect to,\namong other things, the determination of interest periods,\nobservation periods and interest reset dates, and the timing\nand frequency of determining rates and making payments of\ninterest. The application of a Benchmark Replacement and\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation of\nBenchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, could result in\nadverse consequences to the amount of interest payable on the\nSOFR-linked\nnotes, which could adversely affect the return on, value of\nand market for such notes.\n\n10\n\nCitigroup (or its affiliate) will have authority to make\ndeterminations, decisions and elections that could affect the\nreturn on, value of and market for the SOFR-linked notes.\n\nUnder the terms of the SOFR-linked notes, Citigroup (or its\naffiliate) will be authorized to make certain determinations,\ndecisions and elections with respect to the interest rate on\nSOFR-linked notes. Citigroup (or its affiliate) will make any\nsuch determination, decision or election in its sole\ndiscretion,\nand any such determination, decision or election that is made\ncould affect the amount of interest payable on SOFR-linked\nnotes. For example, if Citigroup (or its affiliate) determines\nthat a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred, then Citigroup (or its\naffiliate) will determine, among other things, the Benchmark\nReplacement, Benchmark Replacement Adjustment and Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes. Any exercise of discretion by\nus, or by\none of our affiliates, under the terms of the SOFR-linked\nnotes could present a conflict of interest. The interests of\nCitigroup (or its affiliate) in making the determinations\ndescribed above may be adverse to your interests as a holder\nof such\nfloating rate notes. All determinations, decisions or\nelections by Citigroup (or its affiliates), including those\nmade by an affiliate acting as calculation agent, will be\nconclusive and binding absent manifest error.\n\nCertain base rates described herein refer to \u0093benchmarks,\u0094\nincluding LIBOR and EURIBOR, that may be discontinued or\nreformed, which may adversely affect the value of and return\non floating rate notes.\n\nCertain base rates, including LIBOR, the Euro Interbank\nOffered Rate\n(\u0093EURIBOR\u0094) and other rates or indices described herein, are\ndeemed to be \u0093benchmarks\u0094 and are the subject of ongoing\nnational and international regulatory scrutiny and reform.\nSome of these reforms are already effective, while\nothers are still to be implemented or formulated. For example,\non March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited\n(\u0093IBA\u0094), the current LIBOR administrator, announced plans to\ncease publishing LIBOR for several tenors and\ncurrencies (including one-week and 2-month USD LIBOR) on\nDecember 31, 2021, but to extend the publication of the most\ncommonly used LIBOR tenors (overnight and one,\nthree, six and 12 months) until June 30, 2023. This\nannouncement by the IBA is a Benchmark Transition Event.\nAdditionally, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the\nOffice of the\nComptroller of the Currency have strongly encouraged banks to\ncease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nbenchmark rate as soon as practicable and in any event by\nDecember 31, 2021. There is no assurance that LIBOR will\ncontinue\nto be published until any particular date, but as of the date\nhereof, LIBOR will be discontinued or deemed no longer\nrepresentative after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023,\ndepending on the LIBOR currency and tenor.\n\nAny of the international, national or other proposals for\nreform or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094 could\nincrease the costs and risks of administering or otherwise\nparticipating in the setting of a \u0093benchmark\u0094 and complying\nwith any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may\nhave the effect of discouraging market participants from\ncontinuing to administer or contribute to certain\n\u0093benchmarks,\u0094 trigger changes in the rules or methodologies\nused in certain \u0093benchmarks\u0094 or lead to the discontinuance or\nunavailability of quotes of certain\n\u0093benchmarks.\u0094\n\nTo the extent interest payments on a floating rate debt\nsecurity are linked to a specific \u0093benchmark\u0094\nthat is discontinued or is no longer quoted, the applicable\nbase rate will be determined using the alternative methods\ndescribed in \u0093Description of Debt Securities \u0097 Interest Rate\nDetermination.\u0094 Any of these alternative methods may\nresult in interest payments that are different than or that do\nnot otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would\nhave been made on those notes if the relevant \u0093benchmark\u0094 was\navailable in its current form. Under certain of the\nbase rates described herein (including the Treasury Rate and\nthe Prime Rate), the final alternative method sets the\ninterest rate for an interest period at the same rate as the\nimmediately preceding interest period. For the LIBOR base\nrate, a\nBenchmark Replacement will be used to determine the interest\nrate if such base rate is discontinued, as described in\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities \u0097 Interest Rate Determination\n\u0097 Floating Rate Notes, except SOFR Notes \u0097 LIBOR\nNotes.\u0094 For the EURIBOR base rate, a substitute or successor\nbase rate will be used to determine the interest rate if\nEURIBOR is discontinued or is permanently no\n\n11\n\nlonger being published, as described in \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Interest Rate Determination \u0097 Floating Rate\nNotes, except SOFR Notes \u0097 EURIBOR Notes.\u0094 Any of\nthe foregoing may have an adverse effect on the value of such\nnotes, and may cause adverse U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences for holders of such notes.\n\nSOFR differs fundamentally from, and may not be a comparable\nsubstitute for, U.S. dollar LIBOR.\n\nIn June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the\n\u0093ARRC\u0094) convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System\nand the NY Federal Reserve announced the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar\nLIBOR. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo\nfinancing rate that represents overnight secured funding\ntransactions,\nit differs fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR. For example,\nSOFR is a secured overnight rate, while U.S. dollar LIBOR is\nan unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over\ndifferent maturities. In addition, because SOFR is a\ntransaction-based rate, it is backward-looking, whereas U.S.\ndollar LIBOR is forward-looking. Because of these and other\ndifferences, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform\nin the same way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have done at any\ntime,\nand there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute\nfor U.S. dollar LIBOR.\n\nInterest on any floating rate notes linked to EURIBOR will be\ncalculated using a substitute or successor base rate selected\nby Citigroup if EURIBOR is discontinued.\n\nIf, during the term of any\nfloating rate notes linked to EURIBOR, Citigroup (or its\naffiliate) determines that EURIBOR has been discontinued or is\npermanently no longer being published, Citigroup (or such\naffiliate) will use a substitute or successor base rate that\nit has\ndetermined, in its sole discretion after consulting with any\nsource it deems to be reasonable, to be the industry-accepted\nsubstitute or successor base rate, or, if there is no such\nindustry-accepted substitute or successor base rate, a\nsubstitute\nor successor base rate that is most comparable to EURIBOR.\nCitigroup (or such affiliate) also will determine, in its sole\ndiscretion after consulting with any source it deems to be\nreasonable, any adjustments to the relevant methodology or\ndefinitions for calculating such substitute or successor base\nrate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such\nsubstitute or successor base rate comparable to EURIBOR in a\nmanner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices\nfor\nsuch substitute or successor base rate.\n\nThe interests of Citigroup (or its affiliate) in making the\ndeterminations described above may be\nadverse to your interests as a holder of the floating rate\nnotes. The selection of a substitute or successor base rate,\nand any decisions made by Citigroup (or such affiliate) in\nconnection with implementing such substitute or successor base\nrate,\ncould result in adverse consequences to the applicable\ninterest rate on the floating rate notes, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for such\nsecurities. Further, there is no assurance that the\ncharacteristics of any\nsubstitute or successor base rate will be similar to EURIBOR\nor that any substitute or successor base rate will produce the\neconomic equivalent of EURIBOR.\n\nThere may be no trading market for the notes.\n\nIf the floating rate notes are a new issue of securities, they\nwill have no established trading market and will not be listed\non any securities\nexchange. The underwriters will not be obligated to make a\ntrading market in the notes and may discontinue market making\nat any time at their sole discretion. Therefore, no assurance\ncan be given as to the liquidity of or trading markets for any\nseries of notes.\n\n12\n\nCITIGROUP INC.\n\nCitigroup Inc. is a global diversified financial services\nholding company whose businesses provide consumers,\ncorporations, governments and\ninstitutions with a broad, yet focused range of financial\nproducts and services, including consumer banking and credit,\ncorporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, trade\nand securities services and wealth management. Citigroup has\napproximately 200 million customer accounts and does business\nin more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citigroup\ncurrently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two\nprimary business segments: Global Consumer Banking and\nInstitutional Clients Group, with the remaining operations in\nCorporate/Other. Its businesses conduct their activities\nacross the North America, Latin America, Asia and Europe,\nMiddle East and Africa regions. Citigroup\u0092s principal\nsubsidiaries are Citibank, N.A., Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nand Grupo Financiero Citibanamex, S.A. de C.V., each of which\nis a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Citigroup. Citigroup\nwas incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the State of\nDelaware as a corporation with perpetual duration.\n\nCitigroup is a holding company and services its obligations\nprimarily by earnings from\nits operating subsidiaries. Citigroup may augment its capital\nthrough issuances of common stock, noncumulative perpetual\npreferred stock and equity issued through awards under\nemployee benefits plans, among other issuances. Citigroup and\nCitigroup\u0092s subsidiaries that operate in the banking and\nsecurities businesses can only pay dividends if they are in\ncompliance with the applicable regulatory requirements imposed\non them by federal and state bank regulatory authorities and\nsecurities regulators. Citigroup\u0092s subsidiaries may be party\nto credit agreements that also may restrict their ability to\npay dividends. Citigroup currently believes that none of these\nregulatory or contractual restrictions on the ability of\nits subsidiaries to pay dividends will affect Citigroup\u0092s\nability to service its own debt. Citigroup must also maintain\nthe required capital levels of a bank holding company. Under\ncapital regulations, Citigroup must submit a capital plan,\nsubjected to stress testing, to the Federal Reserve, and have\nits stress capital buffer determined annually, before it may\npay dividends on its stock.\n\nCitigroup is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u0093Dodd-Frank\nAct\u0094) and\nthe rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal Reserve to\nperiodically submit a plan for Citigroup\u0092s rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. On December 17, 2019,\nthe Federal Reserve and FDIC issued feedback on the resolution\nplans filed on July 1, 2019 by the eight U.S. Global\nSystemically Important Banks, including Citigroup. The Federal\nReserve and FDIC identified one shortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies,\nin Citigroup\u0092s resolution plan relating to governance\nmechanisms. Based on regulatory changes effective December 31,\n2019, Citigroup\u0092s July 2021 resolution plan submission will be\na \u0093targeted\u0094 resolution plan, only including\na subset of the information of a full resolution plan, as\nidentified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC. Citigroup will\nalternate between a submitting a full resolution plan and a\ntargeted resolution plan on a biennial cycle. On July 1, 2020,\nthe\nFederal Reserve and FDIC provided information to the eight\nlargest domestic banking organizations, including Citigroup,\nrequired to be included in the targeted resolution plans due\non July 1, 2021. For additional information on Citigroup\u0092s\nresolution plan submissions, see \u0093Managing Global\nRisk\u0097Liquidity Risk\u0097Resolution Plan\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s most\nrecent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Citigroup\u0092s preferred\nresolution\nstrategy is \u0093single point of entry\u0094 under the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode.\n\nUnder Citigroup\u0092s preferred \u0093single point of\nentry\u0094 resolution plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent\nholding company, would enter into bankruptcy, while\nCitigroup\u0092s material legal entities (as defined in the public\nsection of its 2019 resolution plan, which can be found on the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC\u0092s websites) would remain operational\nand outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings.\nCitigroup believes its resolution plan has been designed to\nminimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. and global\nfinancial systems, while maximizing the value of the\nbankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup\u0092s creditors,\nincluding the holders of the securities being offered by this\nprospectus. In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve\u0092s\nfinal TLAC rule, Citigroup believes it has developed the\nresolution plan so that Citigroup\u0092s shareholders and unsecured\ncreditors\u0097including the holders of the securities being\noffered by this prospectus\u0097bear any losses resulting from\nCitigroup\u0092s bankruptcy. Accordingly, any value realized by\nholders of the holders of the securities being\n\n13\n\noffered by this prospectus may not be sufficient to repay the\namounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy\nor other resolution proceeding of Citigroup. Claims of holders\nof the\ndebt securities offered by this prospectus and other debt\nsecurities of Citigroup would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of Citigroup\u0092s subsidiaries and to the\nclaims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured\ncreditors\nof Citigroup. Accordingly, in a resolution of Citigroup under\nChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of the debt\nsecurities offered by this prospectus and other debt\nsecurities of Citigroup would realize value only to the extent\navailable\nto Citigroup as a shareholder of its subsidiaries, and only\nafter any claims of priority and secured creditors of\nCitigroup have been fully repaid. If Citigroup were to enter\ninto a resolution, none of Citigroup, the Federal Reserve or\nthe FDIC is\nobligated to follow Citigroup\u0092s preferred resolution strategy\nunder its resolution plan.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in response to\nfeedback received from the Federal Reserve and FDIC, Citigroup\ntook the following actions:\n                                                                \n       Citicorp LLC (\u0093Citicorp\u0094), an existing wholly owned        \n  (i)  subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an           \n       intermediate holding company for certain of Citigroup\u0092s   \n       operating material legal entities;                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with    \n        Citicorp, Citigroup\u0092s operating material legal           \n        entities and certain other affiliated entities          \n  (ii)  pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide       \n        liquidity and capital support to Citigroup\u0092s operating   \n        material legal entities in the event Citigroup were to  \n        enter bankruptcy proceedings                            \n        (\u0093Citi Support Agreement\u0094);                               \n                                                                \n                                                  \n  (iii)  pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:  \n                                                  \n                                                                \n      Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets,         \n      including certain high-quality liquid assets and          \n      inter-affiliate loans (\u0093Contributable Assets\u0094), to          \n      Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business as usual       \n      funding vehicle for Citigroup\u0092s operating material legal   \n      entities;                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer       \n      Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject to    \n      certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among other     \n      things, meet Citigroup\u0092s near-term cash needs;             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will    \n      be required to contribute most of its remaining assets    \n      to                                                        \n      Citicorp; and                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under    \n  (iv)  the Citi Support Agreement, as well as the              \n        Contributable                                           \n        Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.   \n                                                                \nThe Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, besides\nCiticorp\u0092s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant to which\nCiticorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup during\nbusiness as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt service as\nwell as other operating needs: (i) one or more\nfunding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a\ncommitted line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans to\nCitigroup.\n\nIn addition to Citigroup\u0092s required resolution plan under Title\nI of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act grants\nthe FDIC\nthe authority, under certain circumstances, to resolve\nsystemically important financial institutions, including\nCitigroup. This resolution authority is commonly referred to as\nthe FDIC\u0092s \u0093orderly liquidation\nauthority.\u0094 Under the FDIC\u0092s stated preferred \u0093single point of\nentry\u0094 strategy for such resolution, the bank holding company\n(Citigroup) would be placed in receivership; the unsecured long-\nterm debt and shareholders of the\nparent holding company would bear any losses; the FDIC would use\nits power to create a \u0093bridge entity\u0094 for Citigroup; transfer\nthe systemically important and viable parts of its business,\nprincipally the stock of Citigroup\u0092s main\noperating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such\nsubsidiaries, to the bridge entity; and recapitalize the\noperating subsidiaries using assets of Citigroup that have been\ntransferred to the bridge entity and exchange external debt\nclaims against Citigroup for equity in the bridge entity. Under\nthis Title II resolution strategy, the value of the stock of the\nbridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of the debt\nsecurities offered by use of this prospectus and\nother debt securities of Citigroup may not be sufficient to\n\n14\n\nrepay all or part of the principal amount and interest on the\ndebt securities and those other securities. Any of the\nsecurities being offered by this prospectus may be fully\nsubordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S. government in the event of a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding with\nrespect to Citigroup, including a proceeding under the \u0093orderly\nliquidity authority\u0094 provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nTo date, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of\nentry resolution strategy and it is not obligated to follow such\na strategy in a Title II resolution of Citigroup.\n\nUnder the regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding\ncompany is expected to act as a source of financial strength for\nits subsidiary\nbanks. As a result of this regulatory policy, the Federal\nReserve might require Citigroup to commit resources to its\nsubsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of Citigroup or its shareholders or creditors.\n\nThe principal office of Citigroup is located at 388 Greenwich\nStreet, New York, New York 10013, and its telephone number is\n(212) 559-1000.\n\n15\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS AND HEDGING\n\nGeneral. Citigroup will use the proceeds it receives from the\nsale of the offered securities for general\ncorporate purposes, which may include:\n                                                    \n      funding the business of its operating units;  \n                                                    \n                                                                \n      funding investments in, or extensions of credit or        \n      capital contributions to, its subsidiaries;               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      financing possible acquisitions or business expansion;    \n      and                                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      lengthening the average maturity of liabilities, which    \n      means that it could reduce its short-term liabilities or  \n      refund maturing indebtedness.                             \n                                                                \nCitigroup expects to incur additional indebtedness in the future\nto fund its businesses.\nCitigroup or one or more subsidiaries may enter into a swap\nagreement in connection with the sale of the offered securities\nand may earn additional income from that transaction.\n\nUse of Proceeds Relating to Index Warrants and Indexed Notes.\nCitigroup or one or more of its subsidiaries may\nuse all or some of the proceeds received from the sale of index\nwarrants or indexed notes to purchase or maintain positions in\nthe underlying assets. Citigroup or one or more of its\nsubsidiaries may also purchase or maintain positions in options,\nfutures contracts, forward contracts or swaps, or options on the\nforegoing, or other derivative or similar instruments relating\nto the relevant index or underlying assets. Citigroup may also\nuse the proceeds to pay the costs and expenses of hedging\nany currency, interest rate or other index-related risk relating\nto such index warrants and indexed notes.\n\nCitigroup expects that it or\none or more of its subsidiaries will increase or decrease their\ninitial hedging position over time using techniques which help\nevaluate the size of any hedge based upon a variety of factors\naffecting the value of the underlying instrument. These\nfactors may include the history of price changes in that\nunderlying instrument and the time remaining to maturity.\nCitigroup or one or more of its subsidiaries may take long or\nshort positions in the index, the underlying assets, options,\nfutures\ncontracts, forward contracts, swaps, or options on the\nforegoing, or other derivative or similar instruments related to\nthe index or the underlying assets. These other hedging\nactivities may occur from time to time before the index warrants\nand\nindexed notes mature and will depend on market conditions and\nthe value of the index and the underlying assets.\n\nIn addition, Citigroup or\none or more of its subsidiaries may purchase or otherwise\nacquire a long or short position in index warrants and indexed\nnotes from time to time and may, in their sole discretion, hold,\nresell, exercise, cancel or retire such offered securities.\nCitigroup or one or more of its subsidiaries may also take\nhedging positions in other types of appropriate financial\ninstruments that may become available in the future.\n\nIf Citigroup or one or more of its subsidiaries has a long hedge\nposition in, or options, futures contracts or swaps or options\non the\nforegoing, or other derivative or similar instruments related\nto, the index or underlying assets, Citigroup or one or more of\nits subsidiaries may liquidate all or a portion of its holdings\nat or about the time of the maturity or earlier redemption\nor repurchase of, or the payment of any indexed interest on, the\nindex warrants and indexed notes. The aggregate amount and type\nof such positions are likely to vary over time depending on\nfuture market conditions and other factors. Since the\nhedging activities described in this section involve risks and\nmay be influenced by a number of factors, it is possible that\nCitigroup or one or more of its subsidiaries may receive a\nprofit from the hedging activities, even if the market value of\nthe index warrants or indexed notes declines. Citigroup is only\nable to determine profits or losses from any such position when\nthe position is closed out and any offsetting position or\npositions are taken into account.\n\nCitigroup has no reason to believe that its hedging activities,\nas well as those of its subsidiaries, will have a material\nimpact on the price\nof such options, futures contracts, forward contracts, swaps,\noptions on the foregoing, or other derivative or similar\ninstruments, or on the value of the index or the underlying\nassets.\n\n16\n\nHowever, Citigroup cannot guarantee you that its hedging\nactivities, as well as those of its subsidiaries, will not\naffect such prices or values. Citigroup will use the remainder\nof the proceeds\nfrom the sale of index warrants and indexed notes for the\ngeneral corporate purposes described above.\n\n17\n\nEUROPEAN MONETARY UNION\n\nThe foreign currencies in which notes may be denominated or\npayments in respect of index warrants may be due or by which\namounts due on the\noffered securities may be calculated could be issued by\ncountries that are member states of the European Union that have\nadopted or adopt the single Euro currency in accordance with the\nTreaty establishing the European Community (as that Treaty is\namended from time to time) (the \u0093Participating Member States\u0094).\n\nThe current Participating Member States are: Austria, Belgium,\nBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,\nRomania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. Other member\nstates of the European Union may also become participating\nmember states of the single Euro currency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThe debt securities offered by this prospectus will be unsecured\nobligations of Citigroup and will be either senior or\nsubordinated debt.\nSenior debt securities will be issued under a senior debt\nindenture dated as of November 13, 2013, as supplemented.\nSubordinated debt securities will be issued under a subordinated\ndebt indenture dated as of April 12, 2001, as\nsupplemented. The senior debt indenture and any of its\nsupplements and the subordinated debt indenture and any of its\nsupplements are sometimes referred to in this prospectus\nindividually as an \u0093indenture\u0094 and collectively as the\n\u0093indentures.\u0094 The indentures (or forms thereof) and any\nsupplements have been filed with the SEC and are incorporated by\nreference or included in the registration statement on Form S-3\nunder the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, of which this prospectus\nforms a part.\n\nThe following briefly summarizes the material provisions of\nthe indentures and the debt securities, other than pricing and\nrelated terms disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement\nor pricing supplement, as the case may be. You should read the\nmore detailed provisions of the applicable indenture,\nincluding the defined terms, for provisions that may be\nimportant to you. You should also read the particular terms of\nan offering of debt securities, which will be described in more\ndetail in the applicable prospectus supplement or pricing\nsupplement, as the case may be. Copies of the indentures may be\nobtained from Citigroup or the applicable trustee. So that you\nmay easily locate the more detailed provisions, the numbers in\nparentheses below refer to sections in the applicable\nindenture or, if no indenture is specified, to sections in each\nof the indentures. Wherever particular sections or defined terms\nof the applicable indenture are referred to, such sections or\ndefined terms are incorporated into this prospectus by\nreference, and the statements in this prospectus are qualified\nby that reference. If any debt securities are to be issued under\nan indenture having terms that differ from those described\nbelow, the terms of such indenture will be as described in the\napplicable supplement for the offering of such debt securities.\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093supplement\u0094 means either\na prospectus supplement or a pricing supplement, as applicable.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of\ndebt securities, the trustee under the senior debt indenture and\nunder the subordinated indenture will be The Bank of New York\nMellon.

The\nsupplement\nrelating to debt securities denominated in a foreign currency\nwill specify the denomination of such debt securities.\n\nThe currency for\npayment for book-entry debt securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency will be specified in the applicable supplement.\nHowever, when interests in such debt securities are held through\nDTC, all payments in respect of such debt securities will be\nmade in U.S. dollars. See \u0093\u0097 Book-Entry Procedures and\nSettlement\u0094 and \u0093Currency Conversions and Foreign Exchange Risks\nAffecting Debt Securities Denominated in a Foreign Currency \u0097\nCurrency Conversion\u0094\nbelow.\n\n21\n\nCitigroup may, without notice to or consent of the holders or\nbeneficial owners of a series of\ndebt securities, issue additional debt securities having the\nsame ranking, interest rate, maturity and other terms as the\ndebt securities initially issued. Any such debt securities could\nbe considered part of the same series of debt securities under\nthe indenture as the debt securities initially issued.\n\nThe senior debt securities will be issued only in registered\nform. The\nsubordinated debt securities may be issued in registered form,\nbearer form, or both; however, unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of subordinated debt\nsecurities, the subordinated debt securities will be issued in\nregistered form. If bearer securities are issued, the United\nStates federal income tax consequences and other special\nconsiderations, procedures and limitations applicable to such\nbearer securities will be described in the applicable\nsupplement. As\ncurrently anticipated, debt securities of a series will trade in\nbook-entry form, and global notes will be issued in physical\n(paper) form, as described below under \u0093\u0097 Book-Entry Procedures\nand Settlement.\u0094\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, the debt securities may be\npresented for exchange, and\ndebt securities other than a global security may be presented\nfor registration of transfer, at the principal trust office of\nthe relevant trustee in New York City. Holders will not have to\npay any service charge for any registration of transfer or\nexchange of debt securities, but Citigroup may require payment\nof a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental\ncharge payable in connection with such registration of transfer.\n(Senior Debt Indenture, Section3.06; Subordinated Debt\nIndenture, Section2.05) Debt securities in bearer form will be\ntransferable by delivery. Provisions with respect to the\nexchange of debt securities in bearer form will be described in\nthe applicable\nsupplement.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities denominated in a foreign currency, a\nfiscal agency agreement will be entered into in relation to the\ndebt securities between Citigroup and Citibank, N.A., London\nBranch, as registrar, fiscal agent and principal paying agent.\nThe terms \u0093registrar,\u0094 \u0093fiscal agent,\u0094\nand \u0093principal paying agent\u0094 shall include any successors\nappointed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of\nthe fiscal agency agreement, and any reference to an \u0093agent\u0094 or\n\u0093agents\u0094 shall mean any or all\n(as applicable) of such persons. The holders of the debt\nsecurities are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, the\nprovisions of the fiscal agency agreement. Unless otherwise\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, copies of the fiscal agency agreement are available\nfor inspection during usual business hours at the principal\noffice of Citibank, N.A., London Branch, located at Citigroup\nCentre, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, England.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, the debt securities are intended to\nqualify as\neligible long-term debt for purposes of the TLAC rule. As a\nresult, in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy or other\nresolution proceeding, Citigroup\u0092s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on\nCitigroup\u0092s\nshareholders and then on its unsecured creditors, including the\nholders of the debt securities. Further, in a bankruptcy or\nother resolution proceeding of Citigroup, any value realized by\nholders of the debt securities may not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed on the debt securities. For more information\nabout the final TLAC rule and its consequences for the debt\nsecurities, you should refer to the section \u0093Managing Global\nRisk \u0097 Liquidity Risk \u0097 Long-Term Debt \u0097\nResolution Plan\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\u0094 in\nCitigroup\u0092s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPayments of Principal and Interest\n\nPayments of principal and interest on debt securities issued in\nbook-entry form will be made as described below under\n\u0093\u0097 Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement.\u0094 Payments of principal\nand interest on debt securities issued in definitive form, if\nany, will be made as described below under \u0093\u0097 Definitive Notes\nand Paying Agents.\u0094\n\nInterest on the debt securities will be paid on the dates\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities (each, an\n\u0093interest payment date\u0094). If an interest payment date for a\nfixed rate note or the maturity\n\n22\n\ndate or redemption date of the debt securities falls on a day\nthat is not a Business Day, the payment due on such interest\npayment date or on the maturity date or redemption date will be\npostponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no further\ninterest will accrue in respect of such postponement. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\ndebt securities, if an interest payment date for a floating\nrate note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such\ninterest payment date will be the next following Business Day\nunless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case\nthe interest payment date will be the first preceding Business\nDay.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, all payments of interest on the\ndebt\nsecurities will be made to the persons in whose names the notes\nare registered at the close of business on the Business Day\npreceding an interest payment date.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, in this section, \u0093Business Day\u0094\nmeans any\nday which is a day on which commercial banks settle payments and\nare open for general business (a) in New York, in the case of\nU.S. dollar-denominated debt securities; (b) in New York, London\nand Tokyo, in the case of Yen-denominated debt securities; (c)\nin New York and Sydney, in the case of Australian dollar\n(\u0093A$\u0094)-denominated debt securities; and (d) in New York and\nLondon and which is also a TARGET\nbusiness day (\u0093TARGET\u0094), in the case of Euro-denominated debt\nsecurities. A \u0093TARGET business day\u0094 is a day on which TARGET 2\nis open for the settlement of payment in Euro, and \u0093TARGET 2\u0094 is\nthe Trans-European Automated\nReal-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer payment system which\nutilizes a single shared platform and which was launched on\nNovember 19, 2007. Unless otherwise specified in connection with\na particular offering of debt securities, in the case\nof Canadian dollar-denominated debt securities, \u0093Business Day\u0094\nshall mean any Toronto business day which is a day on which\ncommercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments\nand are open for general business (including dealings\nin foreign currency deposits and foreign exchange) in Toronto.\n\nIf a date for payment of interest or principal on the debt\nsecurities\nfalls on a day that is not a business day in the place of\npayment, such payment will be made on the next succeeding\nbusiness day in such place of payment as if made on the date the\npayment was due. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable\nfor\nthe period from and after the due date for payment of such\nprincipal or interest.\n\nInterest Rate Determination\n\nFixed Rate Notes\n\nUnless otherwise\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, each fixed rate note will bear interest from its\noriginal issue date, or from the last interest payment date to\nwhich interest has been paid or duly provided for, at the rate\nper\nannum stated in the applicable supplement until its principal\namount is paid or made available for payment.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities,\ninterest on each fixed rate note will be payable semi-annually\nin arrears on the dates set forth in the applicable supplement,\nwith each such day being an interest payment date, and at\nmaturity. Unless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of debt securities, interest on U.S.-dollar-\ndenominated fixed rate notes will be calculated on the basis of\na 360-day year\ncomprised of twelve 30-day months or, in the case of an\nincomplete month, the number of days elapsed. The day-count for\nfixed rate notes denominated in any other\ncurrency will be set forth in the applicable supplement. All\nU.S. dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro amounts resulting from\nthis calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-\nhalf cent being rounded\nupward. All Yen amounts resulting from this calculation will be\nrounded to the nearest Yen, with five-tenths or more of \u00a51 to be\nrounded upwards to the nearest \u00a51 per debt security. The\nrounding convention for any other currency will be\nset forth in the applicable supplement. Interest on Australian\ndollar-denominated debt securities for any period will be\ncalculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and\nthe actual number of days in the year. All Australian dollar\namounts resulting from this calculation will be rounded to the\nnearest Australian cent, with five-tenths or more of A$0.01 to\nbe rounded upwards to the nearest A$0.01 per note.\n\n23\n\nFloating Rate Notes \u0096 Compounded SOFR Notes\n\nSOFR is published by the NY Federal Reserve and is intended to\nbe a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by\nU.S. Treasury securities. The NY Federal Reserve reports that\nSOFR includes all trades in the Broad General Collateral Rate,\nplus bilateral U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement (\u0093repo\u0094)\ntransactions cleared through the\ndelivery-versus-payment service offered by the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (the \u0093FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of The\nDepository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\u0093DTC\u0094). SOFR is\nfiltered by the NY Federal Reserve to remove a\nportion of the foregoing transactions considered to be\n\u0093specials\u0094. According to the NY Federal Reserve, \u0093specials\u0094 are\nrepos for specific-issue collateral which take place at cash-\nlending rates below those for general collateral\nrepos because cash providers are willing to accept a lesser\nreturn on their cash in order to obtain a particular security.\n\nThe NY Federal\nReserve reports that SOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted\nmedian of transaction-level tri-party repo data collected from\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, which currently acts as the\nclearing bank for the tri-party repo market, as well as General\nCollateral Finance Repo transaction data and data on bilateral\nU.S. Treasury repo transactions cleared through the FICC\u0092s\ndelivery-versus-payment service. NY Federal\nReserve states that it obtains information from DTCC Solutions\nLLC, an affiliate of DTC. The NY Federal Reserve currently\npublishes the Secured Overnight Financing Rate daily on its\nwebsite at https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr.\nThe\nNY Federal Reserve states on its publication page for SOFR that\nuse of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations and\nindemnification obligations, including that NY Federal Reserve\nmay alter the methods of calculation, publication\nschedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any\ntime without notice.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of debt securities, each Compounded SOFR\nnote will bear interest at an annual rate initially equal to\nCompounded SOFR (as defined below) plus any spread or spread\nmultiplier specified in the note and the applicable supplement.\nInterest will be payable quarterly in arrears on the second\nBusiness Day (as defined below) following each interest period\nend date (as specified in the note and the applicable\nsupplement); provided that the interest payment date with\nrespect\nto the final interest period will be a redemption date, if\napplicable, or the maturity date.\n\nInterest for each interest period will be\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount of the SOFR note\nby the product of (i) Compounded SOFR plus the applicable spread\nor spread multiplier (as specified in the note and the\napplicable supplement) multiplied by (ii) the quotient\nof actual number of calendar days in such interest period\ndivided by 360; provided that in no event will the interest\npayable on the SOFR notes be less than zero. Interest will be\ncalculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed\nand a year of 360 days.\n\n\u0093Interest period\u0094 means the period from, and including, each\ninterest period end date (as specified in\nthe note and the applicable supplement) to, but excluding, the\nnext succeeding interest period end date; provided that, if\nCitigroup has an option to early redeem the Compounded SOFR\nnotes, the interest period following an election by\nCitigroup to redeem the notes, and the final interest period\nwill be the period from, and including, the immediately\npreceding interest period end date to, but excluding, the\nredemption date or the maturity date; and provided further that\nCompounded SOFR for each calendar day from, and including, the\nRate Cut-Off Date (as defined below) to, but excluding, the\nredemption date or the maturity date will equal SOFR in respect\nof the Rate Cut-Off Date.\n\nIn the event that any interest period end date (other than a\nredemption date or the\nmaturity date) is not a Business Day (as defined below), then\nsuch date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day,\nunless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case\nthe interest period end date will be the immediately\npreceding Business Day. In the event that the maturity date or a\nredemption date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then\nsuch date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day,\nand no further interest will accrue with respect to such\npostponement.\n\n24\n\nFor the purposes of calculating interest with respect to any\ninterest period for a Compounded\nSOFR note:\n\n\u0093Compounded SOFR\u0094 means a rate of return of a daily compounded\ninterest investment calculated in accordance with the\nformula below, with the resulting percentage being rounded, if\nnecessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage\npoint (0.00000005 being rounded upwards):\n\nwhere\n\n\u0093do\u0094, for any interest period, is the number of U.S. Government\nSecurities Business Days in the relevant interest period.\n\n\u0093i\u0094 is a series of whole numbers from one to do, each\nrepresenting the relevant U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Days in chronological order from, and including, the\nfirst U.S. Government Securities Business Day in the relevant\ninterest period.\n\n\u0093SOFRi\u0094, for any day \u0093i\u0094 in the relevant interest period, is a\nreference rate equal to SOFR in respect of\nthat day.\n\n\u0093ni\u0094, for any day \u0093i\u0094 in the relevant interest period, is the\nnumber of calendar days from,\nand including, such U.S. Government Securities Business Day \u0093i\u0094\nto, but excluding, the following U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Day.\n\n\u0093d\u0094 is the number of calendar days in the relevant interest\nperiod.\n\n\u0093U.S. Government Securities Business Day\u0094 means any day except\nfor a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which the Securities\nIndustry\nand Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) recommends that the\nfixed income departments of its members be closed for the entire\nday for purposes of trading in U.S. government securities.\n\n\u0093SOFR\u0094 means, with respect to any day, the rate determined by\nthe calculation agent in accordance with the following\nprovisions:\n                                                                \n       the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for trades made on  \n       such day that appears at approximately 3:00 p.m. (New    \n  (1)  York City time) on the NY Federal Reserve\u0092s Website on    \n       the U.S. Government Securities Business Day immediately  \n       following such day (\u0093SOFR Determination Time\u0094); or         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       if the rate specified in (1)\u00a0above does not so appear,   \n       unless a Benchmark Transition Event and its related      \n       Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred as described    \n       in (3)\u00a0below, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate       \n  (2)  published on the NY Federal Reserve\u0092s Website for the     \n       first preceding U.S. Government Securities Business Day  \n       for which the Secured                                    \n       Overnight Financing Rate was published on the NY         \n       Federal Reserve\u0092s Website; or                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related          \n       Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the    \n  (3)  relevant                                                 \n       interest period end date, the calculation agent will     \n       use the Benchmark Replacement to determine the rate and  \n       for all other purposes relating to the notes.            \n                                                                \nEffect of Benchmark Transition Event\n\n.

The \u0093Reuters Screen\nCDOR Page\u0094 means the display designated as page \u0093CDOR\u0094 on the\nReuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may\nreplace the CDOR page on that or any\nother service, by the Administrator) for purposes of publishing\nor displaying, among other things, Canadian dollar bankers\u0092\nacceptance rates.\n\nIf such rate does not appear on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page on\nsuch day, CDOR for such period will be determined using the\ndisplay designated\nas page \u0093CDOR\u0094 on Bloomberg or an equivalent service that\ndisplays\n\n40\n\naverage bid rates of interest for Canadian dollar bankers\u0092\nacceptances with maturities of three months (an \u0093Alternative\nCDOR Page\u0094) as of the time of day at which such Alternative\nCDOR Page becomes available.\n\nIf no such Alternative CDOR Page is available on such day, then\nCDOR for such interest period will be the\naverage of the bid rates of interest (expressed and rounded as\nset forth above) for Canadian dollar bankers\u0092 acceptances with\nmaturities of three months for same-day settlement as quoted by\nthree of the\nfive largest Schedule I banks (as defined in the Bank Act\n(Canada)) selected by Citigroup (or one of its affiliates) as\nmay quote such a rate as of approximately 10:15 a.m., Toronto\ntime, on the first business day of such interest period.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if Citigroup (or one of its\naffiliates) determines that CDOR has been permanently or\nindefinitely\ndiscontinued, then Citigroup (or such affiliate) shall use, as a\nsubstitute for CDOR and for each future interest payment date,\nthe alternative reference rate selected or recommended by the\ncentral bank, monetary authority, relevant regulatory\nsupervisor or any similar institution (including any committee\nor working group thereof), or identified through any other\napplicable regulatory or legislative action or guidance, that is\nconsistent with accepted market practice for debt obligations\nsuch as the CDOR notes (the \u0093Alternative Rate\u0094). As part of such\nsubstitution, Citigroup (or such affiliate) shall make such\nadjustments to the Alternative Rate and the spread thereon, as\nwell as the business day convention, interest\npayment dates and related provisions and definitions, in each\ncase that are consistent with accepted market practice or\napplicable regulatory or legislative action or guidance for the\nuse of such Alternative Rate for debt obligations such as the\nCDOR notes. If Citigroup (or such affiliate) determines that\nthere is no clear market consensus as to an Alternative Rate,\nCitigroup (or such affiliate) shall determine an appropriate\nalternative reference rate and adjustments thereto, and the\ndecision shall be binding on the calculation agent and the\nnoteholders. If Citigroup (or such affiliate) is unable to\ndetermine an appropriate alternative reference rate and\nadjustments, CDOR for such interest period shall be CDOR for the\nimmediately preceding interest period, and the process set forth\nin this paragraph to determine an Alternative Rate shall be\nrepeated for each subsequent interest period until such time as\nan Alternative Rate is determined or, in the case of the\nfirst interest period during the floating rate period, the most\nrecent rate that could have been determined in accordance with\nthis provision had the interest rate on the notes been a\nfloating rate during the fixed rate period.\n\nBBSW Rate Notes. Each BBSW note will bear interest at a rate\nequal to the Australian dollar\nBank-Bill Reference Rate (the \u0093BBSW Rate\u0094) and any spread or\nspread multiplier specified in the note and the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine the BBSW Rate for each\ninterest period on each interest determination date. The\ninterest determination\ndate is the first day of each interest period. The BBSW Rate\nwill be the rate for prime bank eligible securities having a\ntenor closest to the interest period which is designated as the\n\u0093AVG MID\u0094 on the Reuters Screen BBSW Page at\napproximately 10:30 a.m. (or such other time at which such rate\ncustomarily appears on that page), Sydney time, on the interest\ndetermination date.\n\nIf the rate is not published prior to 10:45 a.m. (or such other\ntime that is 15 minutes after the then-prevailing time), Sydney\ntime, on the\ninterest determination date, or if it is displayed but the\ncalculation agent determines that there is an obvious error in\nthat rate, then the BBSW Rate will be the rate determined by an\nalternative financial institution appointed by the calculation\nagent (upon written direction of Citigroup) to be most\ncomparable to the BBSW Rate and which is consistent with\nindustry accepted practices. Such rate will notified in writing\nto the calculation agent (with a copy to the Citigroup) by such\nalternate\nfinancial institution..\n\n\u0093Reuters Screen BBSW page\u0094 means the display which appears on\nthe display on Reuters (or any successor\nservice) as page \u0093BBSW\u0094 (or any other page as may replace such\npage), for the purpose of displaying BBSW rates or base lending\nrates of major Australian banks.\n\nAll percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of\ninterest will be expressed as a percentage per annum and will be\nrounded, if\nnecessary, to the nearest 1/10,000 of 1% (.0001), with five\nhundred thousandths of a percentage point rounded upward.\n\n41\n\nFixed Rate/Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Rate Reset Notes.\n\nThe applicable supplement may provide that a debt security will\nbe a fixed rate note for a specified portion of its term and a\nfloating rate\nnote for the remainder of its term. In such an event, the\ninterest rate on the debt security will be determined as if it\nwere a fixed rate note and a floating rate note for each\nrespective period, all as specified herein and in the applicable\nsupplement. The applicable supplement may provide that a debt\nsecurity will be a fixed rate note for a specified portion of\nits term and then reset that fixed rate at specified intervals\nfor the remainder of its term. In such event, the interest\nrate on the debt security will be determined as specified herein\nand in the applicable supplement.\n\nDual Currency Debt Securities\n\nCitigroup may from time to time offer dual currency debt\nsecurities on which Citigroup has the option of making all\npayments of principal and\ninterest on such debt securities, the payments on which would\notherwise be made in the specified currency of those debt\nsecurities, in the optional payment currency specified in the\napplicable supplement. This option will be exercisable in whole\nbut\nnot in part on an option election date, which will be any of the\ndates specified in the applicable supplement. Information as to\nthe relative value of the specified currency compared to the\noptional payment currency will be set forth in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nThe supplement for each issuance of dual currency debt\nsecurities will specify, among other things, the specified\ncurrency; the optional payment currency; and the designated\nexchange rate. The designated exchange rate will be a fixed\nexchange rate used for converting amounts denominated in the\nspecified currency into amounts denominated in the optional\npayment\ncurrency. The supplement will also specify the option election\ndates and interest payment dates for the related issuance of\ndual currency debt securities. Each option election date will be\na particular number of days before an interest payment date\nor maturity, as set forth in the applicable supplement. Each\noption election date will be the date on which Citigroup may\nselect whether to make all scheduled payments due thereafter in\nthe optional payment currency rather than in the specified\ncurrency.\n\nIf Citigroup makes such an election, the amount payable in the\noptional payment currency will be determined using the\ndesignated exchange rate specified in the applicable supplement.\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, if such an election is made, notice\nof the election will be provided in accordance with the\nterms of the dual currency debt securities within two business\ndays of the option election date. The notice will state (1) the\nfirst date, whether an interest payment date and/or maturity, on\nwhich scheduled payments in the optional payment\ncurrency will be made and (2) the designated exchange rate.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, any\nsuch notice by Citigroup, once given, may not be withdrawn. The\nequivalent value in the specified currency of payments made\nafter such an election may be less, at the then current exchange\nrate, than if Citigroup had made the payment in the specified\ncurrency.\n\nFor United States federal income tax purposes, holders of dual\ncurrency debt securities may need to comply with rules which\ndiffer from the\ngeneral rules applicable to holders of other types of debt\nsecurities offered by this prospectus. The United States federal\nincome tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and\ndisposition of dual currency debt securities will be set forth\nin the\napplicable supplement.\n\nExtension of Maturity\n\nIf so stated in the supplement relating to a particular offering\nof debt securities, Citigroup may extend the stated maturity of\nthose debt\nsecurities for an extension period.

We will register\nthe global securities in the name of a depositary or its nominee\nand deposit the global securities with that depositary. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, The Depository Trust Company, New\nYork, New York, or DTC, will be the depositary if we use a\ndepositary.\n\nFollowing the issuance of a global security in registered form,\nthe depositary will credit the accounts of its participants with\nthe debt\nsecurities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly\nor indirectly through financial institutions that are\nparticipants in the depositary can hold beneficial interests in\nthe global securities. Because the laws of some jurisdictions\nrequire certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of\nsuch securities in definitive form, you may encounter\ndifficulties in your ability to own, transfer or pledge\nbeneficial interests in a global security.\n\nSo long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner\nof a global security, we and the relevant trustee will treat the\ndepositary\nas the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes\nof the applicable indenture. Therefore, except as set forth\nbelow, you will not be entitled to have debt securities\nregistered in your name or to receive physical delivery of\ncertificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly, you\nwill have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the\nparticipant in the depositary through whom you hold your\nbeneficial interest in order to exercise any rights of a holder\nunder the indenture. We understand that under existing\npractices, the depositary would act upon the instructions of a\nparticipant or authorize that participant to take any action\nthat a holder is entitled to take.\n\nYou may elect to hold interests in the global securities either\nin the United States through DTC or outside the United States\nthrough\nClearstream Banking, S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094) or Euroclear Bank,\nS.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear\nSystem, (\u0093Euroclear\u0094) if you are a participant of such system,\nor indirectly through organizations that are\nparticipants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream\nand Euroclear will\n\n47\n\nbe recorded on DTC\u0092s books as being held by the U.S. depositary\nfor each of Clearstream and Euroclear, which U.S. depositaries\nwill in turn hold interests on behalf of their\nparticipants\u0092 customers\u0092 securities accounts.\n\nAs long as the debt securities are represented by the global\nsecurities, we will\npay principal of and interest and premium, if any, on those\nsecurities to or as directed by DTC as the registered holder of\nthe global securities. Payments to DTC will be in immediately\navailable funds by wire transfer. DTC, Clearstream or\nEuroclear, as applicable, will credit the relevant accounts of\ntheir participants on the applicable date. Neither we nor the\nrelevant trustee will be responsible for making any payments to\nparticipants or customers of participants or for maintaining\nany records relating to the holdings of participants and their\ncustomers, and you will have to rely on the procedures of the\ndepositary and its participants.\n\nIf an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency\nother than the U.S. dollar, we will make payments of principal\nand any interest in\nthe foreign currency in which the debt securities are\ndenominated or, only for notes held through DTC, in U.S.\ndollars. See \u0093Currency Conversions and Foreign Exchange Risks\nAffecting Debt Securities Denominated in a Foreign Currency\n\u0097 Currency Conversion\u0094 below.\n\nSettlement\n\nYou will be required to make your initial payment for the debt\nsecurities in immediately available funds. Secondary market\ntrading between DTC\nparticipants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with\nDTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds\nusing DTC\u0092s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Secondary market\ntrading between\nClearstream customers and/or Euroclear participants will occur\nin the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and\noperating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear and will be\nsettled using the procedures applicable to conventional\neurobonds in immediately available funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding directly or\nindirectly through DTC, on the one\nhand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream customers\nor Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC\nin accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European\ninternational clearing system by U.S. depositary;\nhowever, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of\ninstructions to the relevant European international clearing\nsystem by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its\nrules and procedures and within its established deadlines\n(based on European time). The relevant European international\nclearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement\nrequirements, deliver instructions to the U.S. depositary to\ntake action to effect final settlement on its behalf by\ndelivering or receiving debt securities in DTC, and making or\nreceiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-\nday funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream customers\nand Euroclear\nparticipants may not deliver instructions directly to their\nrespective U.S. depositaries.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of\ndebt securities received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result\nof a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during\nsubsequent securities settlement processing and dated the\nbusiness day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or\nany transactions in such debt securities settled during such\nprocessing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream\ncustomers or Euroclear participants on such business day.

Thereafter, the holders of the\ndefinitive debt\nsecurities will be recognized as the \u0093holders\u0094 of the debt\nsecurities under the applicable indenture.\n\nThe applicable indenture\nprovides for the replacement of a mutilated, lost, stolen or\ndestroyed definitive debt security, so long as the applicant\nfurnishes to Citigroup and the trustee such security or\nindemnity and such evidence of ownership as they may require.\n\nIn the event definitive debt securities are issued, the holders\nof definitive debt securities will be able to receive payments\nof principal\nand interest on their debt securities at the office of\nCitigroup\u0092s paying agent maintained in the Borough of Manhattan\n(in the case of holders of U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities or holders of debt securities denominated in a\nforeign\ncurrency electing to receive payments in U.S. dollars) and in\nLondon (in the case of holders of debt securities denominated in\na foreign currency not electing to receive payments in U.S.\ndollars). Payment of principal of a definitive debt security\nmay be made only against surrender of the debt security to one\nof Citigroup\u0092s paying agents.

A form\nof such instrument of transfer will be obtainable at the\nrelevant office of Citibank, N.A.. Upon surrender, Citigroup\nwill execute, and the trustee will authenticate and deliver, new\ndebt securities to the designated transferee in the amount being\ntransferred, and a new debt security for any amount not being\ntransferred will be issued to the transferor. Such new\nsecurities will be delivered free of charge at the relevant\noffice\nof Citibank, N.A., as requested by the owner of such new debt\n\n49\n\nsecurities.

In the event of (i) any conflict\nbetween a provision of the senior debt indenture and the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939, as amended (the \u0093TIA\u0094) or (ii) the\nomission of a provision required to be included in the senior\ndebt indenture by the TIA, the TIA will control.\n\nSubordinated Debt\n\nThe subordinated debt\nsecurities will be issued under the subordinated debt indenture,\nwill be unsecured obligations of Citigroup, will rank\nsubordinated and junior in right of payment, to the extent set\nforth in the subordinated debt indenture, to all \u0093Senior\nIndebtedness\u0094 (as defined below) of Citigroup and will rank\nequally with all other unsecured and subordinated indebtedness\nof Citigroup, whether existing at the time of issuance or\ncreated thereafter, other than subordinated indebtedness which\nis designated as junior to the subordinated debt securities. In\nthe event of (i) any conflict between a provision of the\nsubordinated debt indenture and the TIA, or (ii) the omission of\na provision required to be included in the\nsubordinated debt indenture by the TIA, the TIA will control.\n\nIf Citigroup defaults in the payment of any principal of, or\npremium, if\nany, or interest on any Senior Indebtedness when it becomes due\nand payable after any applicable grace period, then, unless and\nuntil the default is cured or waived or ceases to exist,\nCitigroup cannot make a payment on account of or redeem or\notherwise acquire the subordinated debt securities.\nNevertheless, holders of subordinated debt securities may still\nreceive and retain:\n                                                                \n      securities of Citigroup or any other corporation          \n      provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment  \n      that                                                      \n      are subordinate, at least to the same extent that the     \n      subordinated debt securities are subordinate to Senior    \n      Indebtedness; and                                         \n                                                                \n50\n                                                                \n      payments made from a defeasance trust as described        \n      below.                                                    \n                                                                \nIf there is any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or other\nsimilar proceeding relating to Citigroup, its creditors or its\nproperty, then all\nSenior Indebtedness must be paid in full before any payment may\nbe made to any holders of subordinated debt securities.

The indentures\nprovide that Citigroup will not merge or consolidate with\nanother entity or sell other than for cash or lease all or\nsubstantially all its assets to another entity, except if such\nlease or sale is to\none or more of its Subsidiaries, unless:\n                                                                \n      either (1)\u00a0Citigroup is the continuing entity, or (2)\u00a0    \n      the successor entity, if other than Citigroup, in         \n      the case of the senior debt indenture is a U.S. entity,   \n      and expressly assumes by supplemental indenture the       \n      obligations evidenced by the securities issued pursuant   \n      to the indenture; and                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      in the case of the senior debt indenture or if provided   \n      in the applicable supplement for a series of              \n      subordinated                                              \n      debt, immediately after the transaction, there would not  \n      be any default in the performance of any covenant or      \n      condition of the indenture (Senior Debt Indenture,        \n      Sections 5.05 and 16.05; Subordinated Debt Indenture,     \n      Section\u00a015.01).                                           \n                                                                \nLimitations on Future Issuances of Subordinated Debt Securities\nunder the Subordinated Debt Indenture. The subordinated debt\nindenture provides that any subordinated debt securities issued\nunder the subordinated debt indenture shall either (x) be issued\nwith the concurrence or approval of\nthe staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the staff\nof the Federal Reserve System or (y) qualify at the time of\nissuance for Tier 2 capital treatment (irrespective of any\nlimits on the amount of Citigroup\u0092s Tier 2 capital) under\nthe applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations,\npolicies or published interpretations of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nOther than\nthe restrictions described above, the indentures do not contain\nany covenants or provisions that would protect holders of the\ndebt securities in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.\n\nModification of the Indentures\n\nUnder the\nindentures, Citigroup and the relevant trustee can enter into\nsupplemental indentures to establish the form and terms of any\nseries of debt securities without obtaining the consent of any\nholder of debt securities in certain circumstances described\nin the indentures, including to conform the terms of any series\nof debt securities to the terms specified in the applicable\noffering document.\n\nCitigroup and the trustee may, with the consent of the holders\nof at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the\nsenior debt\nsecurities of a series or at least a majority in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the subordinated debt securities of a series\nthat, in each case, are affected by such modification, modify\nthe applicable indenture or the rights of the holders of the\nsecurities of such series to be affected.\n\nNo such modification may, without the consent of the holder of\neach security so affected:\n                                                         \n      change the fixed maturity of any such securities;

No other event,\nincluding a default that is not also an event of default, will\nresult in acceleration (Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 6.01,\n6.02 and 6.07).\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of subordinated debt, the only events of default\nspecified in the\nsubordinated debt indenture are events of insolvency or\nbankruptcy, whether voluntary or not, with respect to Citigroup.\nOnly these events of default provide for a right of acceleration\nof the subordinated debt securities. No other event, including\na default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or\ninterest on, subordinated debt securities, the performance of\nany other covenant of Citigroup in the subordinated indenture or\nany other default that is not also an event of default, will\nresult in acceleration (Subordinated Debt Indenture, Sections\n6.01, 6.02 and 6.07).\n\nIf an event of default regarding debt\nsecurities of any series issued under the indentures should\noccur and be continuing, either the trustee or the holders of\n25% in the principal amount of outstanding debt securities of\nsuch series may declare each debt security of that series due\nand\npayable (Section 6.02). Citigroup is required to file annually\nwith the trustee a statement of an officer as to the fulfillment\nby Citigroup of its obligations under the indentures during the\npreceding year (Senior Debt Indenture, Section5.06; Subordinated\nDebt Indenture, Section5.04).\n\nNo event of default regarding one\nseries of senior debt securities issued under the senior debt\nindenture is necessarily an event of default regarding any other\nseries of senior debt securities (Senior Debt Indenture,\nSection6.01). For purposes of this\nsection, \u0093series\u0094 refers to debt securities having identical\nterms, except as to issue date, principal amount and, if\napplicable, the date from which interest begins to accrue.\n\nHolders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding\ndebt securities of any series will be entitled to control\ncertain actions of the\ntrustee under the indentures and to waive past defaults\nregarding such series\n\n54\n\n(Sections 6.02 and 6.06). The trustee generally will not be\nunder any obligation to act at the request, order or direction\nof any of the holders of debt securities, unless one or more of\nsuch holders shall have offered to the trustee security or\nindemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (Section 10.01).\n\nIf a default\noccurs regarding a series of debt securities, the trustee may\nuse any sums that it collects under the relevant indenture for\nits own reasonable compensation and expenses incurred prior to\npaying the holders of debt securities of such series\n(Section 6.05).\n\nBefore any holder of any series of debt securities may institute\naction for any remedy, except payment on such\nholder\u0092s debt security when due, the holders of not less than\n25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series\noutstanding must request the trustee to take action. Holders\nmust also offer security and indemnity reasonably\nsatisfactory to the trustee against liabilities incurred by the\ntrustee for taking such action (Section 6.07).\n\nDefeasance\n\nSenior Debt Indenture. Unless otherwise specified in connection\nwith a particular offering of senior debt\nsecurities, after Citigroup has deposited with the trustee cash\nand/or U.S. government securities or, in the case of debt\nsecurities denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars,\nafter Citigroup has deposited with the trustee funds in the\ncurrency specified in the applicable supplement and/or other\ngovernment securities specified in the applicable supplement in\ntrust for the benefit of the holders sufficient to pay the\nprincipal of, premium, if any, and interest on the senior debt\nsecurities of such series when due, then Citigroup, at its\noption:\n                                                                \n      will be deemed to have paid and satisfied its             \n      obligations on all outstanding senior debt securities of  \n      such                                                      \n      series, which is known as \u0093defeasance and discharge\u0094        \n      (Senior Debt Indenture, Section\u00a012.02); or                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      will cease to be under any obligation under specific      \n      covenants, relating to the senior debt securities of      \n      such                                                      \n      series, which is known as \u0093covenant defeasance\u0094 (Senior     \n      Debt Indenture, Section\u00a012.03).                           \n                                                                \nIn the case of both defeasance and discharge and covenant\ndefeasance, Citigroup must also deliver to the trustee an\nopinion of counsel to the\neffect that the holders of the senior debt securities of such\nseries will have no United States federal income tax\nconsequences as a result of such deposit (Senior Debt Indenture,\nSection12.04).\n\nWhen there is a defeasance and discharge, (1) the senior debt\nindenture will no longer govern the senior debt securities of\nsuch series,\n(2) Citigroup will no longer be liable for payment and (3) the\nholders of such senior debt securities will be entitled only to\nthe deposited funds. When there is a covenant defeasance,\nhowever, Citigroup will continue to be obligated to\nmake payments when due if the deposited funds are not\nsufficient.\n\nThe obligations and rights under the senior debt indenture\nregarding\ncompensation, reimbursement and indemnification of the trustee,\noptional redemption, mandatory or optional sinking fund\npayments, if any, registration of transfer and exchange of the\nsenior debt securities of such series, replacement of mutilated,\ndestroyed, lost or stolen senior debt securities and certain\nother administrative provisions will continue even if Citigroup\nexercises its defeasance and discharge or covenant defeasance\noptions (Senior Debt Indenture, Sections 12.02 and 12.03).\n\nUnder current United States federal income tax law, defeasance\nand discharge should be treated as a taxable exchange of the\nsenior debt securities for an interest in the trust. As a\nconsequence, each holder of the senior debt securities would\nrecognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the value\nof the holder\u0092s interest in the trust and holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis for the senior debt securities deemed\nexchanged, except to the extent attributable to accrued but\nunpaid interest, which will be taxable as ordinary income. Each\nholder would then be required to include in income his share of\nany\nincome, gain and loss recognized by the trust. Even though\nUnited States federal income tax on the deemed exchange would be\nimposed on a holder, the holder would not receive any cash until\nthe maturity or an earlier redemption of the senior debt\nsecurities, except for any current interest\n\n55\n\npayments. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax\nadvisors as to the specific consequences of a defeasance and\ndischarge, including the applicability and effect of tax laws\nother\nthan the United States federal income tax law.\n\nUnder current United States federal income tax law, a covenant\ndefeasance would not be\ntreated as a taxable exchange of senior debt securities.\n\nSubordinated Debt Indenture.Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\nsubordinated debt securities, the defeasance and discharge and\ncovenant defeasance provisions contained in the subordinated\ndebt indenture will apply and are substantially the same as\nthose described above for the senior debt indenture\n(Subordinated Debt Indenture, Sections 11.01, 11.02, 11.03,\n11.04 and 11.05).\n\nUnder the subordinated debt indenture, in the case of both\ndefeasance and discharge and covenant defeasance, Citigroup must\nalso deliver to\nthe trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders\nof the subordinated debt securities will have no United States\nfederal income tax consequences as a result of such deposit.\n\nConcerning the Trustee\n\nCitigroup has had\nand may continue to have banking relationships with the trustee\nin the ordinary course of business.\n\n56\n\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following is a general\nsummary of United States federal income tax considerations that\nmay be relevant to a beneficial owner of a debt security.

Purchasers of such notes should carefully examine\nthe\napplicable supplement and should consult with their tax advisors\nwith respect to such notes. Prospective purchasers of debt\nsecurities with maturities of one year should be aware that\nspecial United States federal income tax rules apply to\nshort-term debt instruments, and should consult with their tax\nadvisors with respect to such securities.\n\nProspective investors should\nconsult their tax advisors in determining the tax consequences\nto them of purchasing, holding, and disposing of the debt\nsecurities, including the application to their particular\nsituation of the United States federal income tax considerations\ndiscussed below, as well as the application of state, local,\nforeign or other tax laws.\n\nAs used in this summary, the term \u0093United\nStates holder\u0094 means a beneficial owner of a debt security who\nis a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic\ncorporation or is otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax\non a net income basis in respect of the debt securities. The\nterm \u0093non-United States holder\u0094 means a beneficial owner of a\ndebt security who is not a United States holder.\n\n57\n\nUnited States Holders\n\nPayments of Interest\n\nPayments of\nqualified stated interest, as defined below under \u0093Original\nIssue Discount,\u0094 on a debt security will be taxable to a United\nStates holder as ordinary interest income at the time that such\npayments are accrued or are received, in accordance\nwith the United States holder\u0092s method of tax accounting.\n\nIf such payments of interest are made in foreign currency with\nrespect to\na debt security that is denominated in such foreign currency,\nthe amount of interest income realized by a United States holder\nthat uses the cash method of tax accounting will be the U.S.\ndollar value of the specified currency payment based on the\nspot rate of exchange on the date of receipt regardless of\nwhether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. No\nexchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the\nreceipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss\nrealized\non the disposition of the foreign currency so received, see\n\u0093Transactions in Foreign Currency,\u0094 below). A United States\nholder of DTC debt securities (as defined below) that uses the\ncash method of tax accounting and receives a payment of\ninterest in U.S. dollars should realize interest income equal to\nthe amount of U.S. dollars received. A United States holder that\nuses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest\nincome on the foreign currency debt security in the\nrelevant foreign currency and translate the amount accrued into\nU.S. dollars based on:\n                                                                \n      the average exchange rate in effect during the interest   \n      accrual period, or portion thereof, within such           \n      holder\u0092s taxable year; or                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      at such holder\u0092s election, at the spot rate of exchange    \n      on (i)\u00a0the last day of the accrual period, or             \n      the last day of the taxable year within such accrual      \n      period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable  \n      year, or (ii)\u00a0the date of receipt, if such date is        \n      within five business days of the last day of the accrual  \n      period.                                                   \n                                                                \nSuch election must be applied consistently by the United States\nholder to all debt instruments from year to year and\ncan be changed only with the consent of the IRS. A United States\nholder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will\nrecognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an\ninterest payment made relating to a foreign currency debt\nsecurity, including interest payments relating to DTC debt\nsecurities made in U.S. dollars, if the spot rate of exchange on\nthe date the payment is received differs from the rate\napplicable to a previous accrual of that interest income. Such\nforeign\ncurrency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or\nloss, but generally will not be treated as an adjustment to\ninterest income received on the debt securities.\n\nPurchase, Sale and Retirement of Debt Securities\n\nA United States holder\u0092s tax basis in a debt security generally\nwill equal the cost of such debt security to such holder:\n                                                                \n      increased by any amounts includible in income by the      \n      holder as original issue discount (\u0093OID\u0094) and               \n      market discount (each as described below); and            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      reduced by any amortized premium and any payments other   \n      than payments of qualified stated interest (each as       \n      described below) made on such debt security.              \n                                                                \nIn the case of a foreign currency debt security, the cost of\nsuch debt\nsecurity to a United States holder will generally be the U.S.\ndollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date\nof purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that\ndate. In the case of a foreign currency debt security that is\ntraded on an established securities market, a United States\nholder generally should determine the U.S. dollar value of the\ncost of such debt security by translating the amount paid in\nforeign currency into its U.S. dollar value at the spot rate of\nexchange (i) on the settlement date of the purchase in the case\nof a United States holder using the cash method of tax\naccounting or (ii) on the trade date, in the case of a United\nStates holder using the accrual method of tax accounting,\nunless such holder elects to use the spot rate applicable to\ncash method United States holders. The\n\n58\n\namount of any subsequent adjustments to a United States holder\u0092s\ntax basis in a foreign currency debt security in respect of OID,\nmarket discount and premium will be determined in the manner\ndescribed under \u0093Original Issue Discount,\u0094 \u0093Market Discount\u0094 and\n\u0093Debt Securities Purchased at a Premium\u0094 below. The conversion\nof U.S. dollars to another specified currency and the immediate\nuse of such specified\ncurrency to purchase a foreign currency debt security generally\nwill not result in any exchange gain or loss for a United States\nholder.\n\nUpon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition\n(collectively, a \u0093disposition\u0094) of a debt security, a United\nStates\nholder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition,\nless any accrued qualified stated interest, which will be\ntaxable as ordinary income in the manner described above under\n\u0093Payments of Interest,\u0094 and (ii) the United States holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis in such debt security. If a United States\nholder receives a specified currency other than the U.S. dollar\nin respect of such disposition of a debt\nsecurity, the amount realized will be the U.S. dollar value of\nthe specified currency received calculated at the spot rate of\nexchange on the date of disposition of the debt security.\n\nIn the case of a foreign currency debt security that is traded\non an established securities market, a United States holder that\nreceives a\nspecified currency other than the U.S. dollar in respect of such\ndisposition generally should determine the amount realized (as\ndetermined on the trade date) by translating that specified\ncurrency into its U.S. dollar value at the spot rate of\nexchange (i) on the settlement date of the disposition in the\ncase of a United States holder using the cash method of tax\naccounting or (ii) on the trade date, in the case of a United\nStates holder using the accrual method of tax\naccounting, unless such holder elects to use the spot rate\napplicable to cash method United States holders. The election\navailable to accrual basis United States holders in respect of\nthe purchase and sale of foreign currency debt securities traded\non an established securities market, discussed above, must be\napplied consistently by the United States holder to all debt\ninstruments from year to year and can be changed only with the\nconsent of the IRS.\n\nExcept as discussed below in connection with foreign currency\ngain or loss and market discount, gain or loss recognized by a\nUnited States\nholder on the disposition of a debt security will generally be\nlong term capital gain or loss if the United States holder\u0092s\nholding period for the debt security exceeds one year at the\ntime of such disposition. Long term capital gains\nrecognized by an individual holder generally are subject to tax\nat a lower rate than short-term capital gains or ordinary\nincome.\n\nGain or\nloss recognized by a United States holder on the disposition of\na foreign currency debt security generally will be treated as\nordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is\nattributable to changes in exchange rates during the period\nin which the holder held such debt security.\n\nTransactions in Foreign Currency\n\nForeign currency received as interest on, or on a disposition\nof, a debt security will have a tax basis equal to its U.S.\ndollar value at the\ntime such interest is received or at the time such proceeds are\nreceived. The amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or\nother disposition of such foreign currency will be equal to the\ndifference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or\nthe fair market value in U.S. dollars of the other property\nreceived in such sale or other disposition, and (ii) the United\nStates holder\u0092s tax basis in such foreign currency.\n\nA United States holder that purchases a debt security with\npreviously owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain\nor loss in an\namount equal to the difference, if any, between such holder\u0092s\ntax basis in such foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair\nmarket value of such debt security on the date of purchase. Any\nsuch gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or\nloss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. The\nconversion of U.S. dollars to foreign currency and the immediate\nuse of such currency to purchase a debt security generally will\nnot result in any exchange gain or loss for a United\nStates holder.\n\n59\n\nOriginal Issue Discount\n\nIn General. Debt securities with a term greater than one year\nmay be issued with OID for United States federal\nincome tax purposes. Such debt securities are called OID debt\nsecurities in this prospectus. United States holders generally\nmust accrue OID in gross income over the term of the OID debt\nsecurities on a constant yield basis, regardless of their\nregular method of tax accounting. As a result, United States\nholders generally will recognize taxable income in respect of an\nOID debt security in advance of the receipt of cash attributable\nto such income.\n\nOID generally will arise if the stated redemption price at\nmaturity of the debt security exceeds its issue price by at\nleast a de minimis\namount of 0.25% of the debt security\u0092s stated redemption price\nat maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to\nmaturity. OID may also arise if a debt security has particular\ninterest payment characteristics, such as interest holidays,\ninterest payable in additional securities or stepped interest.\nFor this purpose, the issue price of a debt security is the\nfirst price at which a substantial amount of debt securities is\nsold for cash, other than to bond houses, brokers or similar\npersons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,\nplacement agents or wholesalers. The stated redemption price at\nmaturity of a debt security is the sum of all payments due under\nthe debt security, other than payments of qualified\nstated interest. The term qualified stated interest generally\nmeans stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or\nproperty, other than debt instruments of the issuer, at least\nannually during the entire term of the OID debt security at\na single fixed rate of interest or, under particular conditions,\nbased on one or more interest indices.\n\nFor each taxable year of a United\nStates holder, the amount of OID that must be included in gross\nincome in respect of an OID debt security will be the sum of the\ndaily portions of OID for each day during such taxable year or\nany portion of such taxable year in which such a United\nStates holder held the OID debt security. Such daily portions\nare determined by allocating to each day in an accrual period a\npro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period.\nAccrual periods may be of any length and may vary in length\nover the term of an OID debt security. However, accrual periods\nmay not be longer than one year and each scheduled payment of\nprincipal or interest must occur on the first day or the final\nday of a period.\n\nThe amount of OID allocable to any accrual period generally will\nequal (i) the product of the OID debt security\u0092s adjusted issue\nprice at the beginning of such accrual period multiplied by its\nyield to maturity (as adjusted to take into account the length\nof such accrual period), less (ii) the amount, if any, of\nqualified stated interest allocable to that accrual period.\nThe adjusted issue price of an OID debt security at the\nbeginning of any accrual period will equal the issue price of\nthe OID debt security, as defined above, (i) increased by\npreviously accrued OID from prior accrual periods, and\n(ii) reduced by any payment made on such debt security, other\nthan payments of qualified stated interest, on or before the\nfirst day of the accrual period. The yield to maturity of an OID\ndebt security is the discount rate (appropriately\nadjusted to reflect the length of accrual periods) that causes\nthe present value on the issue date of all payments on the OID\ndebt security to equal the issue price. In the case of an OID\ndebt security that is a floating rate debt security, both the\nyield to maturity and the qualified stated interest will be\ndetermined for these purposes as though the OID debt security\nwill bear interest in all periods at a fixed rate generally\nequal to the value, as of the issue date, of the floating\ninterest\nrate on the OID debt security or, in the case of some floating\nrate notes, the rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably\nexpected for the OID debt security. (Additional rules may apply\nif interest on a floating rate debt security is based on\nmore than one interest index.) As a result of this \u0093constant\nyield\u0094 method of including OID in income, the amounts includible\nin income by a United States holder in respect of an OID debt\nsecurity generally are lesser in the early years\nand greater in the later years than the amounts that would be\nincludible on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe book/tax conformity rule applies\nto OID in some cases, and therefore may require accrual method\nholders to include OID on an OID debt security in a more\naccelerated manner than described above in this section if they\ndo so for financial accounting purposes. It is uncertain what\nadjustments, if any, should be made in later accrual periods\nwhen taxable income exceeds income reflected on the United\nStates holder\u0092s financial statements to reflect the accelerated\naccrual of income in earlier periods. In addition, it is\npossible, although less\n\n60\n\nlikely, that accrual method holders may be required to include\nde minimis OID in gross income as the de minimis OID accrues on\ntheir financial statements. The application of the book-tax\nconformity rule to OID and de minimis OID is uncertain, and\naccrual method taxpayers should consult with their tax advisors\non how the rule may apply to their investment in the debt\nsecurities.\n\nForeign Currency Debt Securities.In the case of an OID debt\nsecurity that is also a foreign currency\ndebt security, a United States holder should determine the U.S.\ndollar amount includible in income as OID for each accrual\nperiod by:\n                                                                \n      calculating the amount of OID allocable to each accrual   \n      period in the specified currency using the                \n      constant-yield                                            \n      method described above; and                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      translating the amount of the specified currency so       \n      derived at the average exchange rate in effect during     \n      that                                                      \n      accrual period, or portion of such accrual period within  \n      a United States holder\u0092s taxable year, or, at the United   \n      States holder\u0092s election (as described above under         \n      \u0093Payments of Interest\u0094), at the spot rate of exchange on    \n      (i)\u00a0the last day of the accrual period, or the last day   \n      of the taxable year within such accrual period if the     \n      accrual period spans more than one taxable year, or (ii)  \n      on the date of receipt, if such date is within five       \n      business days of the                                      \n      last day of the accrual period.                           \n                                                                \nAll payments on an OID debt security, other than payments of\nqualified stated interest,\nwill generally be viewed first as payments of previously accrued\nOID, to the extent thereof, with payments attributed first to\nthe earliest accrued OID, and then as payments of principal.\nUpon the receipt of an amount attributable to OID, whether in\nconnection with a payment of an amount that is not qualified\nstated interest or the disposition of the OID debt security, a\nUnited States holder will recognize ordinary income or loss\nmeasured by the difference between (i) the amount received\nand (ii) the amount accrued. The amount received will be\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the\ndate of receipt or on the date of disposition of the OID debt\nsecurity. The amount accrued will be determined by using the\nspot rate of exchange applicable to such previous accrual.\n\nAcquisition Premium. A United States holder that\npurchases an OID debt security for an amount less than or equal\nto the remaining redemption amount, but in excess of the OID\ndebt security\u0092s adjusted issue price, generally is permitted to\nreduce the daily portions of OID by a fraction. The\nnumerator of such fraction is the excess of the United States\nholder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the OID debt security immediately\nafter its purchase over the OID debt security\u0092s adjusted issue\nprice. The denominator of such fraction is the\nexcess of the remaining redemption amount over the OID debt\nsecurity\u0092s adjusted issue price. For purposes of this\nprospectus,\n                                                                \n      \u0093remaining redemption amount\u0094 means the sum of all amounts  \n      payable on an OID debt security after the                 \n      purchase date other than payments of qualified stated     \n      interest.                                                 \n                                                                \nThe debt securities may have special redemption,\nrepayment or interest rate reset features, as indicated in the\napplicable supplement. Debt securities containing such features,\nin particular OID debt securities, may be subject to special\nrules that differ from the general rules discussed above.\nAccordingly, purchasers of debt securities with such features\nshould carefully examine the applicable supplement, and should\nconsult their tax advisors relating to such debt securities.\n\nMarket Discount\n\nIf a United States\nholder purchases a debt security for an amount that is less than\nthe debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity or, in\nthe case of an OID debt security, for an amount that is less\nthan the debt security\u0092s revised issue price,\ni.e., the debt security\u0092s issue price increased by the amount of\naccrued OID, the debt security will be considered to have market\ndiscount. The market discount rules are subject to a de minimis\nrule similar to the rule relating to de\nminimis OID, described above (in the second paragraph under\n\u0093Original Issue Discount\u0094). Any gain recognized by the United\nStates holder on the disposition of debt securities having\nmarket discount generally will be treated as ordinary\nincome to the extent of the market discount that accrued on the\ndebt security while held by such United States holder.\n\n61\n\nAlternatively, the United States holder may elect to include\nmarket discount in income currently\nover the life of the debt security. Such an election will apply\nto market discount debt securities acquired by the United States\nholder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to\nwhich such election applies and is revocable only with the\nconsent of the IRS. Market discount will accrue on a straight-\nline basis unless the United States holder elects to accrue the\nmarket discount on a constant-yield method. Such an election\nwill apply to the debt security to which it is made and is\nirrevocable. Unless the United States holder elects to include\nmarket discount in income on a current basis, as described\nabove, the United States holder could be required to defer the\ndeduction of a portion of the interest paid on any indebtedness\nincurred or maintained to purchase or carry the debt security.\n\nMarket discount on a foreign currency debt security will be\naccrued by a\nUnited States holder in the specified currency. The amount\nincludible in income by a United States holder in respect of\nsuch accrued market discount will be the U.S. dollar value of\nthe amount accrued. This is generally calculated at the spot\nrate\nof exchange on the date that the debt security is disposed of by\nthe United States holder. Any accrued market discount on a\nforeign currency debt security that is currently includible in\nincome will be translated into U.S. dollars at the average\nexchange rate for the accrual period or portion of such accrual\nperiod within the United States holder\u0092s taxable year.\n\nUnder the\nbook/tax conformity rule, an accrual method holder that has made\nthe election described above in the second paragraph of this\nsection may be required to accrue market discount in a more\naccelerated manner than described therein if the holder does so\nfor financial accounting purposes. It is also possible, although\nless likely, that accrual method holders that have not made the\nelection described in such paragraph and that accrue market\ndiscount on a current basis on their financial statements\nmay be required to accrue market discount\u0097including de minimis\nmarket discount\u0097currently for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe application of the book/tax conformity rule to debt security\nwith market discount is uncertain, and\naccrual method taxpayers should consult with their tax advisors\non how the rule may apply to their investment in the debt\nsecurities.\n\nDebt Securities Purchased at a Premium\n\nA United States holder that purchases a debt security for an\namount in excess of the remaining redemption\namount will be considered to have purchased the debt security at\na premium and the OID rules will not apply to such holder. Such\nholder may elect to amortize such premium, as an offset to\ninterest income, using a constant-yield method, over the\nremaining term of the debt security. Such election, once made,\ngenerally applies to all debt instruments held by the United\nStates holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to\nwhich the election applies and to all debt instruments\nsubsequently acquired by the United States holder. Such election\nmay be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A United States\nholder that elects to amortize such premium must reduce its tax\nbasis in a debt security by the amount of the premium\namortized during its holding period. For a United States holder\nthat does not elect to amortize bond premium, the amount of such\npremium will be included in the United States holder\u0092s tax basis\nwhen the debt security matures or is disposed of\nby the United States holder. Therefore, a United States holder\nthat does not elect to amortize premium and holds the debt\nsecurity to maturity will generally be required to treat the\npremium as capital loss when the debt security matures.\n\nAmortizable bond premium in respect of a foreign currency debt\nsecurity will be computed in the specified currency and will\nreduce interest\nincome in the specified currency. At the time amortized bond\npremium offsets interest income, exchange gain or loss, which\nwill be taxable as ordinary income or loss, will be realized on\nthe amortized bond premium on such debt security based on the\ndifference between (i) the spot rate of exchange on the date or\ndates such premium is recovered through interest payments on the\ndebt security and (ii) the spot rate of exchange on the date on\nwhich the United States holder acquired the\ndebt security. See \u0093Original Issue Discount \u0097Acquisition\nPremium\u0094 above for a discussion of the treatment of a debt\nsecurity purchased for an amount less than or equal to the\nremaining redemption amount but in excess of the debt\nsecurity\u0092s adjusted issue price.\n\n62\n\nForeign Currency Notes and Reportable Transactions\n\nA United States holder that participates in a \u0093reportable\ntransaction\u0094 will be required to disclose its participation to\nthe IRS. The\nscope and application of these rules is not entirely clear. A\nUnited States holder may be required to treat a foreign currency\nexchange loss from a foreign currency debt security as a\nreportable transaction if the loss exceeds $50,000 in a single\ntaxable year if the United States holder is an individual or\ntrust, or higher amounts for other United States holders. In the\nevent the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the foreign\ncurrency debt security constitutes participation in a\n\u0093reportable transaction\u0094 for purposes of these rules, a United\nStates holder will be required to disclose its investment to the\nIRS, currently on Form 8886. Prospective purchasers should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the application\nof these rules to the acquisition, ownership or disposition of a\nforeign currency debt security.\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\nInformation returns may be required to be filed with the IRS\nrelating to payments made to particular United States holders of\ndebt securities.\nIn addition, United States holders may be subject to a backup\nwithholding tax on such payments if they do not provide their\ntaxpayer identification numbers in the manner required, fail to\ncertify that they are not subject to backup withholding tax,\nor otherwise fail to comply with applicable backup withholding\ntax rules. United States holders may also be subject to\ninformation reporting and backup withholding tax with respect to\nthe proceeds from a disposition of the debt securities. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be\nallowed as a credit against the United States holder\u0092s United\nStates federal income tax liability provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\n\nNon-UnitedStates Holders\n\nSubject to the discussion below under \u0093\u0097 FATCA,\u0094 under current\nUnited States federal income tax law:\n                                                                \n      withholding of United States federal income tax will not  \n      apply to payments of interest on a debt security to a     \n      non-United States holder, provided that,                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       the holder does not actually or constructively own 10%   \n       or more of the total combined voting power of all        \n  (1)  classes of stock of Citigroup entitled to vote and is    \n       not a controlled foreign corporation related to          \n       Citigroup through stock ownership;                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       the beneficial owner provides its name and address and   \n       certifies (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN or Form          \n  (2)  W-8BEN-E), under penalties of perjury, that it is a      \n       non-United States holder in                              \n       compliance with applicable requirements; and             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       neither Citigroup nor its paying agent has actual        \n  (3)  knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner    \n       of the                                                   \n       debt security is a United States holder.                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      withholding of United States federal income tax will      \n      generally not apply to any gain realized on the           \n      disposition                                               \n      of a debt security.                                       \n                                                                \nIn general, backup withholding and information reporting will\nnot apply to a payment of interest on\na debt security to a non-United States holder, or to proceeds\nfrom the disposition of a debt security by a non-United States\nholder, in each case, if the holder\ncertifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-United\nStates holder and neither Citigroup nor its paying agent has\nactual knowledge, or reason to know, to the contrary. Any\namounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules will be refunded or credited against\nthe non-United States holder\u0092s United States federal income tax\nliability provided the required information is timely furnished\nto the IRS. In\ncertain circumstances, if a debt security is not held through a\nqualified intermediary, the amount of payments made on such debt\nsecurity, the name and address of the beneficial owner and the\namount, if any, of tax withheld may be reported to the\nIRS.\n\n63\n\nFATCA\n\nUnder the U.S. tax rules known as the Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance Act (\u0093FATCA\u0094), a holder of debt securities will\ngenerally be\nsubject to 30% U.S. withholding tax on payments made on the debt\nsecurities if the holder (i) is, or holds its debt securities\nthrough, a foreign financial institution that has not entered\ninto an agreement with the U.S. government to report,\non an annual basis, certain information regarding accounts with\nor interests in the institution held by certain United States\npersons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or\npartially owned by\nUnited States persons, or that has been designated as a\n\u0093nonparticipating foreign financial institution\u0094 if it is\nsubject to an intergovernmental agreement between the United\nStates and a foreign country, or (ii) fails to provide\ncertain documentation (usually an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E)\ncontaining information about its identity, its FATCA status, and\nif required, its direct and indirect U.S. owners. The adoption\nof, or implementation of, an intergovernmental agreement between\nthe United States and an applicable foreign country, or future\nU.S. Treasury regulations, may modify these requirements.\nIf any taxes were to be deducted or withheld from any payments\nin respect of the debt securities as a result of a beneficial\nowner or intermediary\u0092s failure to comply with the foregoing\nrules, no additional amounts will be paid on the debt\nsecurities as a result of the deduction or withholding of such\ntax. You should consult your own tax advisor on how these rules\nmay apply to your investment in the debt securities.\n\n64\n\nCURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS AFFECTING\n\nDEBT SECURITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY\n\nCurrency Conversions\n\nUnless otherwise\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, debt securities denominated in a foreign currency\nwhich are offered and sold in the United States (\u0093DTC debt\nsecurities\u0094) will be represented by beneficial interests in\nfully registered permanent global debt securities (\u0093DTC global\ndebt securities\u0094) which will be deposited with Citibank, N.A.,\nLondon Branch, as custodian for, and registered in the name of\nCede & Co., as nominee for, DTC. While\ninterests in the DTC debt securities are held through the DTC\nglobal debt securities, all payments in respect of such debt\nsecurities will be made in U.S. dollars.\n\nAs determined by the exchange agent under the terms of the\nfiscal agency agreement, in accordance with reasonable market\npractice, the amount\nof U.S. dollars payable in respect of any particular payment\nunder the DTC debt securities will be equal to the amount of the\nrelevant foreign currency U.S.$ rate of exchange prevailing as\nof 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day which is two\nBusiness Days prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs\nincurred by the exchange agent for such conversion (to be shared\npro rata among the holders of DTC debt securities accepting U.S.\ndollar payments in the proportion of their respective\nholdings), all in accordance with the fiscal agency agreement.\nIf an exchange rate bid quotation is not available, the exchange\nagent shall obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign\nexchange bank in London selected by the exchange agent for such\npurpose after consultation with Citigroup. If no bid quotation\nfrom a leading foreign exchange bank is available, payment will\nbe in the relevant foreign currency to the account or accounts\nspecified by DTC to the exchange agent. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, a \u0093Business Day\u0094 is a day on which commercial\nbanks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in each of\nNew York City and London.\n\nAlthough DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures, it is under\nno obligation to perform or continue to perform these\nprocedures, and these\nprocedures may be modified or discontinued.\n\nHolders of the debt securities will be subject to foreign\nexchange risks as to payments of\nprincipal and interest that may have important economic and tax\nconsequences to them. For further information as to such\nconsequences, see \u0093\u0097 Foreign Exchange Risks\u0094 below.\n\nJudgments in a Foreign Currency\n\nThe debt\nsecurities will be governed by, and construed in accordance\nwith, the laws of New York State. Courts in the United States\ncustomarily have not rendered judgments for money damages\ndenominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar. A 1987\namendment to the Judiciary Law of New York State provides,\nhowever, that an action based upon an obligation denominated in\na currency other than U.S. dollars will be rendered in the\nforeign currency of the underlying obligation. Any judgment\nawarded\nin such an action will be converted into U.S. dollars at the\nrate of exchange prevailing on the date of the entry of the\njudgment or decree.\n\nForeign Exchange Risks\n\nAn investment in debt securities which are denominated in, and\nall payments in respect of which are to be made in, a\ncurrency other than the currency of the country in which the\npurchaser is a resident or the currency in which the purchaser\nconducts its business or activities (the \u0093home currency\u0094)\nentails significant risks that are not associated with a\nsimilar investment in a security denominated in the home\ncurrency. Such risks include, without limitation, the\npossibility of significant changes in the rates of exchange\nbetween the home currency and the relevant foreign currency and\nthe\npossibility of the imposition or modification of foreign\nexchange controls with respect to the relevant foreign currency.\nSuch risks generally depend on economic and political events\nover which Citigroup has no control. In recent years, rates of\nexchange for foreign currencies have been volatile and such\nvolatility may be expected to continue in the future.\nFluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred\nin the past are not necessarily indicative, however, of\nfluctuations in\nsuch rate that may occur during the\n\n65\n\nterm of the debt securities. Depreciation of the relevant\nforeign currency against the relevant home currency could result\nin a decrease in the effective yield of such relevant foreign\ndenominated debt security below its coupon rate and, in certain\ncircumstances, could result in a loss to the investor on a home\ncurrency basis.\n\nThis description of foreign currency risks does not describe all\nthe risks of an investment in debt securities denominated in a\ncurrency other\nthan the home currency. Prospective investors should consult\nwith their financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved\nin an investment in a particular offering of debt securities.\n\n66\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK WARRANTS\n\nThe following briefly summarizes the material terms and\nprovisions of the common stock warrants. You should read the\nparticular terms of the\ncommon stock warrants that are offered by Citigroup, which will\nbe described in more detail in a supplement. The supplement will\nalso state whether any of the general provisions summarized\nbelow do not apply to the common stock warrants being\noffered. The supplement may add, update or change the terms and\nconditions of the common stock warrants as described in this\nprospectus.\n\nCitigroup may offer common stock warrants pursuant to which it\nmay sell or purchase common stock. The common stock warrants\nwill be issued\nunder common stock warrant agreements to be entered into between\nCitigroup and a bank or trust company, as common stock warrant\nagent. Except as otherwise stated in a supplement, the common\nstock warrant agent will act solely as the agent of\nCitigroup under the applicable common stock warrant agreement\nand will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or\ntrust for or with any owners of common stock warrants. A copy of\nthe form of common stock warrant agreement, including the\nform of common stock warrant certificate, will be filed as an\nexhibit to a document incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.\nYou should read the more detailed provisions of the common stock\nwarrant agreement and the common stock warrant certificate for\nprovisions that may be important to you.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe particular terms of each issue of common stock warrants, the\ncommon stock warrant agreement relating to the common stock\nwarrants and the\ncommon stock warrant certificates representing common stock\nwarrants will be described in the applicable supplement,\nincluding, as applicable:\n                                               \n      the title of the common stock warrants;

You should read the particular terms of the index\nwarrants that are offered by Citigroup, which will be described\nin more detail in a supplement.

For a description of Citigroup\u0092s outstanding\npreferred stock, see \u0093Description of Capital Stock.\u0094\n\nUnder\nCitigroup\u0092s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the board of\ndirectors of Citigroup is authorized to issue shares of\npreferred stock in one or more series, and to establish from\ntime to time a series of preferred stock with the following\nterms specified:\n                                                          \n      the number of shares to be included in the series;  \n                                                          \n                                                                \n      the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the    \n      shares of the series; and                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such   \n      series.                                                   \n                                                                \nPrior to the issuance of any series of preferred stock, the\nboard of directors of Citigroup will adopt resolutions creating\nand designating\nthe series as a series of preferred stock and the resolutions\nwill be filed in a certificate of designation as an amendment to\nthe Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The term \u0093board of\ndirectors of Citigroup\u0094 includes any duly\nauthorized committee.\n\nThe rights of holders of the preferred stock offered may be\nadversely affected by the rights of holders of any\nshares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The\nboard of directors may cause shares of preferred stock to be\nissued in public or private transactions for any proper\ncorporate purpose. Examples of proper corporate purposes include\nissuances to obtain additional financing in connection with\nacquisitions or otherwise, and issuances to officers, directors\nand employees of Citigroup and its subsidiaries pursuant to\nbenefit plans or otherwise. Shares of preferred stock issued by\nCitigroup may have the effect of rendering more difficult or\ndiscouraging an acquisition of Citigroup deemed undesirable by\nthe board of directors of Citigroup.\n\nUnder existing interpretations of Federal Reserve, if the\nholders of the preferred stock become entitled to vote for the\nelection of directors\nbecause dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears as\ndescribed below, preferred stock may then be deemed a \u0093class of\nvoting securities\u0094 and a holder of 25% or more of the preferred\nstock or a holder of 5% or more of the preferred\nstock that is otherwise a bank holding company may then be\nregulated as a \u0093bank holding company\u0094 with respect to Citigroup\nin accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, at\nsuch time:\n                                                                \n      any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S.      \n      presence generally would be required to obtain the        \n      approval                                                  \n      of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or    \n      retain 5% or more of the preferred stock; and             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any person other than a bank holding company may be       \n      required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve    \n      under                                                     \n      the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or retain 10%   \n      or more of the preferred stock.                           \n                                                                \nBefore exercising its option to\nredeem any shares of preferred stock, Citigroup will obtain the\napproval of the Federal Reserve if then required by applicable\nlaw.\n\nThe\npreferred stock will be, when issued, fully paid and\nnonassessable. Holders of preferred stock will not have any\npreemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of\nCitigroup.\n\n91\n\nThe transfer agent, registrar, dividend disbursing agent and\nredemption agent for shares of each\nseries of preferred stock will be named in the supplement\nrelating to such series.\n\nRank\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of preferred stock, such shares will rank on an equal\nbasis with each other\nseries of preferred stock and prior to the common stock as to\ndividends and distributions of assets.\n\nDividends\n\nHolders of each series of preferred stock will be entitled to\nreceive cash dividends when, as and if declared by the board of\ndirectors of\nCitigroup out of funds legally available for dividends. The\nrates and dates of payment of dividends will be set forth in the\nsupplement relating to each series of preferred stock. Dividends\nwill be payable to holders of record of preferred stock as\nthey appear on the books of Citigroup or, if applicable, the\nrecords of the depositary referred to below under \u0093Description\nof Depositary Shares,\u0094 on the record dates fixed by the board of\ndirectors. Dividends on a series of preferred\nstock may be cumulative or noncumulative.\n\nCitigroup may not declare, pay or set apart for payment\ndividends on the preferred stock unless\nfull dividends on other series of preferred stock that rank on\nan equal or senior basis have been paid or sufficient funds have\nbeen set apart for payment for\n                                                                \n      all prior dividend periods of other series of preferred   \n      stock that pay dividends on a cumulative basis; or        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the immediately preceding dividend period of other        \n      series of preferred stock that pay dividends on a         \n      noncumulative basis.                                      \n                                                                \nPartial dividends declared on shares of preferred stock and each\nother series of preferred stock\nranking on an equal basis as to dividends will be declared pro\nrata. A pro rata declaration means that the ratio of dividends\ndeclared per share to accrued dividends per share will be the\nsame for each series of preferred stock.\n\nSimilarly, Citigroup may not declare, pay or set apart for\npayment non-stock dividends or make other\npayments on the common stock or any other stock of Citigroup\nranking junior to the preferred stock until full dividends on\nthe preferred stock have been paid or set apart for payment for\n                                                                \n      all prior dividend periods if the preferred stock pays    \n      dividends on a cumulative basis; or                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the immediately preceding dividend period if the          \n      preferred stock pays dividends on a noncumulative basis.  \n                                                                \nConversion and Exchange\n\nThe supplement for a series of preferred stock will state the\nterms, if any, on which shares of that series are convertible\ninto or\nexchangeable for shares of Citigroup\u0092s common stock.\n\nRedemption\n\nIf so specified in the applicable supplement, a series of\npreferred stock may be redeemable, with the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve if\nrequired, at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of\nCitigroup or the holder thereof and may be mandatorily redeemed.\n\nAny partial\nredemptions of preferred stock will be made in a way that the\nboard of directors decides is equitable.\n\n92\n\nUnless Citigroup defaults in the payment of the redemption\nprice, dividends will cease to accrue\nafter the redemption date on shares of preferred stock called\nfor redemption and all rights of holders of such shares will\nterminate except for the right to receive the redemption price.\n\nLiquidation Preference\n\nUpon any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up\nof Citigroup, holders of each series of preferred stock will be\nentitled to receive distributions upon liquidation in the amount\nset forth in the supplement relating to such series of\npreferred stock, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid\ndividends. Such distributions will be made before any\ndistribution is made on any securities ranking junior relating\nto liquidation, including common stock.\n\nIf the liquidation amounts payable relating to the preferred\nstock of any series and any other securities ranking on a parity\nregarding\nliquidation rights are not paid in full, the holders of the\npreferred stock of such series and such other securities will\nshare in any such distribution of available assets of Citigroup\non a ratable basis in proportion to the full liquidation\npreferences. Holders of such series of preferred stock will not\nbe entitled to any other amounts from Citigroup after they have\nreceived their full liquidation preference.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of shares of\npreferred stock will have no voting rights, except:\n                                              \n      as otherwise stated in the supplement;  \n                                              \n                                                                \n      as otherwise stated in the certificate of designation     \n      establishing such series; and                             \n                                                                \n                                      \n      as required by applicable law.  \n                                      \n93\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES\n\nThe following briefly summarizes the material provisions of the\ndeposit agreement and of the depositary shares and depositary\nreceipts, other\nthan pricing and related terms disclosed in the accompanying\nsupplement. You should read the particular terms of any\ndepositary shares and any depositary receipts that are offered\nby Citigroup and any deposit agreement relating to a particular\nseries of preferred stock, which will be described in more\ndetail in a supplement. The supplement will also state whether\nany of the generalized provisions summarized below do not apply\nto the depositary shares or depositary receipts being offered.\nA copy of the form of deposit agreement, including the form of\ndepositary receipt, is incorporated by reference as an exhibit\nin the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a\npart. You should read the more detailed provisions of the\ndeposit agreement and the form of depositary receipt for\nprovisions that may be important to you.\n\nGeneral\n\nCitigroup may, at its option, elect to offer fractional shares\nof preferred stock, rather than full shares of preferred stock.\nIn such event,\nCitigroup will issue receipts for depositary shares, each of\nwhich will represent a fraction of a share of a particular\nseries of preferred stock.\n\nThe shares of any series of preferred stock represented by\ndepositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement\nbetween Citigroup and\na bank or trust company selected by Citigroup having its\nprincipal office in the United States and having a combined\ncapital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, as preferred stock\ndepositary. Each owner of a depositary share will be entitled to\nall\nthe rights and preferences of the underlying preferred stock,\nincluding dividend, voting, redemption, conversion and\nliquidation rights, in proportion to the applicable fraction of\na share of preferred stock represented by such depositary share.\nThe\ndepositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts\nissued pursuant to the deposit agreement. Depositary receipts\nwill be distributed to those persons purchasing the fractional\nshares of preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the\napplicable supplement.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nThe preferred stock depositary will distribute all cash\ndividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the\ndeposited preferred\nstock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to\nsuch preferred stock in proportion to the number of such\ndepositary shares owned by such holders.\n\nThe preferred stock depositary will distribute any property\nreceived by it other than cash to the record holders of\ndepositary shares entitled\nthereto. If the preferred stock depositary determines that it is\nnot feasible to make such distribution, it may, with the\napproval of Citigroup, sell such property and distribute the net\nproceeds from such sale to such holders.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and other matters\nrelating to depositary shares will be the same as the\ncorresponding record dates\nfor the underlying preferred stock. The amount paid (or deemed\npaid) as dividends or otherwise distributable (or deemed\ndistributable) by the depositary with respect to the depositary\nshares or the underlying preferred stock will be reduced by any\namounts required to be withheld by Citigroup or the preferred\nstock depositary on account of taxes or other governmental\ncharges. The preferred stock depositary may refuse to make any\npayment or distribution, or any transfer, exchange or withdrawal\nof any depositary shares until such taxes or other governmental\ncharges are paid.\n\nRedemption of Preferred Stock\n\nIf a series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares\nis to be redeemed, the depositary shares will be redeemed from\nthe proceeds\nreceived by the preferred stock depositary resulting from the\nredemption, in whole or in part, of such series of preferred\nstock. The depositary shares will be redeemed by the preferred\nstock depositary at a price per depositary share equal to the\napplicable fraction of the redemption price per share payable in\nrespect of the shares of preferred stock so redeemed.\n\n94\n\nWhenever Citigroup redeems shares of preferred stock held by the\npreferred stock depositary, the\npreferred stock depositary will redeem as of the same date the\nnumber of depositary shares representing the shares of preferred\nstock so redeemed. If fewer than all the depositary shares are\nto be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will\nbe selected by the preferred stock depositary by lot or ratably\nor by any other equitable method as the preferred stock\ndepositary may decide. The preferred stock depositary will mail\nnotice of redemption to record holders of the preferred stock\ndepositary receipts not less than 5 and not more than 30 days\nprior to the date fixed for redemption of the preferred stock\nand the related depositary shares.\n\nWithdrawal of Preferred Stock\n\nUnless the\nrelated depositary shares have previously been called for\nredemption, any holder of depositary shares may receive the\nnumber of whole shares of the related series of preferred stock\nand any money or other property represented by such depositary\nreceipts after surrendering the depositary receipts at the\ncorporate trust office of the preferred stock depositary.\nHolders of depositary shares making such withdrawals will be\nentitled to receive whole shares of preferred stock on the basis\nset\nforth in the related supplement for such series of preferred\nstock.\n\nHowever, holders of such whole shares of preferred stock will\nnot be\nentitled to deposit such preferred stock under the deposit\nagreement or to receive depositary receipts for such preferred\nstock after such withdrawal. If the depositary shares\nsurrendered by the holder in connection with such withdrawal\nexceed the\nnumber of depositary shares that represent the number of whole\nshares of preferred stock to be withdrawn, the preferred stock\ndepositary will deliver to such holder at the same time a new\ndepositary receipt evidencing such excess number of\ndepositary shares.\n\nVoting Deposited Preferred Stock\n\nUpon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of\nany series of deposited preferred stock are entitled to vote,\nthe preferred stock\ndepositary will mail the information contained in such notice of\nmeeting to the record holders of the depositary shares relating\nto such series of preferred stock. Each record holder of such\ndepositary shares on the record date will be entitled to\ninstruct the preferred stock depositary to vote the amount of\nthe preferred stock represented by such holder\u0092s depositary\nshares. The preferred stock depositary will try to vote the\namount of such series of preferred stock represented by such\ndepositary shares in accordance with such instructions.\n\nCitigroup will agree to take all reasonable actions that the\npreferred stock\ndepositary determines are necessary to enable the preferred\nstock depositary to vote as instructed. The preferred stock\ndepositary will vote all shares of any series of preferred stock\nheld by it proportionately with instructions received if it does\nnot receive specific instructions from the holders of depositary\nshares representing such series of preferred stock.\n\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement\n\nThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares\nand any provision of the deposit agreement may at\nany time be amended by agreement between Citigroup and the\npreferred stock depositary. However, any amendment that imposes\nadditional charges or materially and adversely alters any\nsubstantial existing right of the holders of depositary shares\nwill\nnot be effective unless such amendment has been approved by the\nholders of at least a majority of the affected depositary shares\nthen outstanding. Every holder of an outstanding depositary\nreceipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective, or\nany transferee of such holder, shall be deemed, by continuing to\nhold such depositary receipt, or by reason of the acquisition\nthereof, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound\nby the deposit agreement, which has been amended thereby.\nThe deposit agreement automatically terminates if:\n                                                             \n      all outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed;  \n                                                             \n95\n                                                                \n      each share of preferred stock has been converted into or  \n      exchanged for common stock; or                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a final distribution in respect of the preferred stock    \n      has been made to the holders of depositary shares in      \n      connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding   \n      up of Citigroup.                                          \n                                                                \nThe deposit agreement may be terminated by\nCitigroup at any time and the preferred stock depositary will\ngive notice of such termination to the record holders of all\noutstanding depositary receipts not less than 30 days prior to\nthe termination date. In such event, the preferred stock\ndepositary will deliver or make available for delivery to\nholders of depositary shares, upon surrender of such depositary\nshares, the number of whole or fractional shares of the related\nseries of preferred stock as are represented by such depositary\nshares.\n\nCharges of Preferred Stock Depositary; Taxes and Other\nGovernmental Charges\n\nNo fees, charges and expenses of the preferred stock depositary\nor any agent of the preferred stock depositary or of any\nregistrar shall be\npayable by any person other than Citigroup, except for any taxes\nand other governmental charges and except as provided in the\ndeposit agreement. If the preferred stock depositary incurs\nfees, charges or expenses for which it is not otherwise liable\nhereunder at the election of a holder of a depositary receipt or\nother person, such holder or other person will be liable for\nsuch fees, charges and expenses.\n\nResignation and Removal of Depositary\n\nThe preferred stock depositary may resign at any time by\ndelivering to Citigroup notice of its intent to do so, and\nCitigroup may at any time\nremove the preferred stock depositary, any such resignation or\nremoval to take effect upon the appointment of a successor\npreferred stock depositary and its acceptance of such\nappointment. Such successor preferred stock depositary must be\nappointed\nwithin 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation or\nremoval and must be a bank or trust company having its principal\noffice in the United States and having a combined capital and\nsurplus of at least $50,000,000.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe preferred stock\ndepositary will forward all reports and communications from\nCitigroup that are delivered to the preferred stock depositary\nand that Citigroup is required to furnish to the holders of the\ndeposited preferred stock.\n\nNeither the preferred stock depositary nor Citigroup will be\nliable if it is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstances\nbeyond its\ncontrol in performing its obligations under the deposit\nagreement. The obligations of Citigroup and the preferred stock\ndepositary under the deposit agreement will be limited to\nperformance with honest intentions of their duties thereunder\nand they\nwill not be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal\nproceeding in respect of any depositary shares, depositary\nreceipts or shares of preferred stock unless satisfactory\nindemnity is furnished. Citigroup and the preferred stock\ndepositary may rely\nupon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon\ninformation provided by holders of depositary receipts or other\npersons believed to be competent and on documents believed to be\ngenuine.\n\n96\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND STOCK PURCHASE UNITS\n\nCitigroup may issue stock purchase contracts, including\ncontracts obligating holders to purchase from or sell to\nCitigroup, and\nCitigroup to sell to or purchase from the holders, a specified\nnumber of shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock or\ndepositary shares at a future date or dates. The consideration\nper share of common stock, preferred stock or depositary\nshares and the number of shares of each may be fixed at the time\nthe stock purchase contracts are issued or may be determined by\nreference to a specific formula set forth in the stock purchase\ncontracts. The stock purchase contracts may be issued\nseparately or as part of units, often known as stock purchase\nunits, consisting of a stock purchase contract and any\ncombination of:\n                        \n      debt securities;  \n                        \n                                                                \n      capital securities issued by trusts, all of whose common  \n      securities are owned by Citigroup or by one of its        \n      subsidiaries;                                             \n                                                                \n                                               \n      junior subordinated debt securities; or  \n                                               \n                                                                \n      debt obligations of third parties, including U.S.         \n      Treasury securities,                                      \n                                                                \nwhich may secure the holders\u0092 obligations to purchase the common\nstock, preferred stock or depositary shares under the stock\npurchase contracts. The\nstock purchase contracts may require Citigroup to make periodic\npayments to the holders of the stock purchase units or vice\nversa, and these payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some\nbasis. The stock purchase contracts may require holders to\nsecure their obligations under those contracts in a specified\nmanner.\n\nThe applicable supplement will describe the terms of the stock\npurchase contracts and stock purchase units, including, if\napplicable, collateral or depositary arrangements.\n\n97\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nCitigroup may offer the offered securities in one or more of the\nfollowing ways from time to time:\n                                              \n      to or through underwriters or dealers;  \n                                              \n                           \n      by itself directly;  \n                           \n                          \n      through agents; or  \n                          \n                                                              \n      through a combination of any of these methods of sale.  \n                                                              \nAny such underwriters, dealers or agents may include any broker-\ndealer subsidiary of Citigroup.\n\nThe supplement relating to an offering of offered securities\nwill set forth the terms of such offering, including:\n                                                                \n      the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or         \n      agents;                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the purchase price of the offered securities and the      \n      proceeds to Citigroup from such sale;                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any underwriting discounts and commissions or agency      \n      fees and other items constituting underwriters\u0092 or         \n      agents\u0092 compensation;                                      \n                                                                \n                                          \n      the initial public offering price;  \n                                          \n                                                                \n      any discounts or concessions to be allowed or reallowed   \n      or paid to dealers; and                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any securities exchanges on which such offered            \n      securities may be listed.                                 \n                                                                \nAny initial public offering prices, discounts or concessions\nallowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be changed from time\nto time.\n\nIf underwriters are used in an offering of offered securities,\nsuch offered securities will be acquired by the underwriters for\ntheir own\naccount and may be resold from time to time in one or more\ntransactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed\npublic offering price or at varying prices determined at the\ntime of sale.

Unless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of securities, the underwriters will not be\nobligated to purchase offered securities unless specified\nconditions are satisfied, and if the underwriters do purchase\nany offered securities, they will purchase all offered\nsecurities.\n\nIn connection with underwritten offerings of the offered\nsecurities and in accordance with applicable law and industry\npractice, underwriters\nmay over-allot or effect transactions that stabilize, maintain\nor otherwise affect the market price of the offered securities\nat levels above those that might otherwise prevail in the open\nmarket, including by entering stabilizing bids, effecting\nsyndicate covering transactions or imposing penalty bids, each\nof which is described below.\n                                                                \n      A stabilizing bid means the placing of any bid, or the    \n      effecting of any purchase, for the purpose of pegging,    \n      fixing or maintaining the price of a security.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      A syndicate covering transaction means the placing of     \n      any bid on behalf of the underwriting syndicate or the    \n      effecting of any purchase to reduce a short position      \n      created in connection with the offering.                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      A penalty bid means an arrangement that permits the       \n      managing underwriter to reclaim a selling concession      \n      from a                                                    \n      syndicate member in connection with the offering when     \n      offered securities originally sold by the syndicate       \n      member are purchased in syndicate covering transactions.  \n                                                                \nThese transactions may be effected on the NYSE, in the over-the-\ncounter\nmarket, or otherwise. Underwriters are not required to engage in\nany of these activities, or to continue such activities if\ncommenced.\n\n98\n\nIf dealers are utilized in the sale of offered securities,\nCitigroup will sell such offered\nsecurities to the dealers as principals. The dealers may then\nresell such offered securities to the public at varying prices\nto be determined by such dealers at the time of resale. The\nnames of the dealers and the terms of the transaction will be\nset forth in the supplement relating to that transaction.\n\nOffered securities may be sold directly by Citigroup to one or\nmore\ninstitutional purchasers, or through agents designated by\nCitigroup from time to time, at a fixed price or prices, which\nmay be changed, or at varying prices determined at the time of\nsale. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of the offered\nsecurities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered will\nbe named, and any commissions payable by Citigroup to such agent\nwill be set forth, in the supplement relating to that offering.\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of securities, any such agent will be acting\non a best efforts basis for the period of its appointment.\n\nAs one of the\nmeans of direct issuance of offered securities, Citigroup may\nutilize the services of an entity through which it may conduct\nan electronic \u0093dutch auction\u0094 or similar offering of the offered\nsecurities among potential purchasers who are\neligible to participate in the auction or offering of such\noffered securities, if so described in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nIf so\nindicated in the applicable supplement, Citigroup will authorize\nagents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain\ntypes of institutions to purchase offered securities from\nCitigroup at the public offering price set forth in such\nsupplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for\npayment and delivery on a specified date in the future. Such\ncontracts will be subject only to those conditions set forth in\nthe supplement and the supplement will set forth the\ncommission payable for solicitation of such contracts.\n\nConflicts of Interest. The broker-dealer subsidiaries of\nCitigroup,\nincluding Citigroup Global Markets Inc., are members of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u0093FINRA\u0094) and may\nparticipate in distributions of the offered securities.\nAccordingly, offerings of offered securities in which\nCitigroup\u0092s broker-dealer subsidiaries participate will conform\nwith the requirements addressing conflicts of interest when\ndistributing the securities of an affiliate set forth in FINRA\nRule 5121. Neither Citigroup Global Markets Inc. nor any\nother broker-dealer subsidiary of Citigroup will sell the\noffered securities to an account over which Citigroup or its\nsubsidiaries have investment discretion unless Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. or such broker-dealer subsidiary has received\nspecific written approval of the transaction from the account\nholder.\n\nThis prospectus, together with any applicable supplement, may\nalso\nbe used by any broker-dealer subsidiary of Citigroup in\nconnection with offers and sales of the offered securities in\nmarket-making transactions, including block positioning and\nblock trades, at negotiated prices related to prevailing market\nprices\nat the time of sale. Any of Citigroup\u0092s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries may act as principal or agent in such transactions.\nNone of Citigroup\u0092s broker-dealer subsidiaries have any\nobligation to make a market in any of the offered securities and\nmay discontinue any market-making activities at any time without\nnotice, at its sole discretion.\n\nOne or more dealers, referred to as\n\u0093remarketing firms,\u0094 may also offer or sell the securities, if\nthe supplement so indicates, in connection with a remarketing\narrangement contemplated by the terms of the securities.\nRemarketing firms will act as principals for their own\naccounts or as agents. The supplement will identify any\nremarketing firm and the terms of its agreement, if any, with\nCitigroup and will describe the remarketing firm\u0092s compensation.\nRemarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters in\nconnection with the remarketing of the securities.\n\nUnderwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under\nagreements with Citigroup, to\nindemnification by Citigroup relating to material misstatements\nand omissions. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be customers\nof, engage in transactions with, or perform services for,\nCitigroup and affiliates of Citigroup in the ordinary course\nof business.\n\nExcept for securities issued upon a reopening of a previous\nseries, each series of offered securities will be a new issue of\nsecurities and will have no established trading market. Any\nunderwriters to whom offered securities\n\n99\n\nare sold for public offering and sale may make a market in such\noffered securities, but such underwriters will not be obligated\nto do so and may discontinue any market making at any time\nwithout\nnotice. The offered securities may or may not be listed on a\nsecurities exchange. No assurance can be given that there will\nbe a market for the offered securities.\n\n100\n\nERISA CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee\nbenefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as\namended (\u0093ERISA\u0094), should consider the fiduciary standards of\nERISA in the context of the ERISA plan\u0092s particular\ncircumstances before authorizing an investment in the offered\nsecurities of Citigroup. Among other factors, the\nfiduciary should consider whether such an investment is in\naccordance with the documents governing the ERISA plan and\nwhether the investment is appropriate for the ERISA plan in view\nof its overall investment policy and diversification of its\nportfolio.\n\nCertain provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094), prohibit employee\nbenefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are\nsubject to Title I of ERISA, plans described in Section\n4975(e)(1) of the Code (including, without limitation,\nretirement accounts and Keogh Plans), and entities whose\nunderlying\nassets include plan assets by reason of a plan\u0092s investment in\nsuch entities (including, without limitation, as applicable,\ninsurance company general accounts) (collectively, \u0093plans\u0094),\nfrom engaging in certain transactions involving\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 with parties that are \u0093parties in interest\u0094 under\nERISA or \u0093disqualified persons\u0094 under the Code with respect to\nthe plan or entity. Governmental and other plans that are not\nsubject to ERISA or to the\nCode may be subject to similar restrictions under state,\nfederal, local or non-U.S. law (\u0093similar law\u0094). Any employee\nbenefit plan or other entity, to which such provisions of ERISA,\nthe Code or\nsimilar law apply, proposing to acquire the offered securities\nshould consult with its legal counsel.\n\nCitigroup has subsidiaries,\nincluding broker-dealer subsidiaries, that provide services to\nmany employee benefit plans. Citigroup and any such direct or\nindirect subsidiary of Citigroup may each be considered a \u0093party\nin interest\u0094 and a \u0093disqualified\nperson\u0094 to a large number of plans.

An investment in\nforeign currency notes, which are notes denominated in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars, entails significant\nrisks that are not associated with a similar investment in a\nsecurity denominated in U.S. dollars. Similarly, an investment\nin an indexed note, on which all or a part of any payment due is\nbased on one or more currencies other than U.S. dollars, has\nsignificant risks that are not associated with a similar\ninvestment in non-indexednotes. Such risks include, but are not\nlimited to:\n                                                                \n      the possibility of significant market changes in          \n      exchange rates between U.S. dollars and the relevant      \n      currencies;                                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the possibility of significant changes in exchange rates  \n      between U.S. dollars and the relevant currencies          \n      resulting from official redenomination or revaluation of  \n      such specified currency; and                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the possibility of the imposition or modification of      \n      foreign exchange controls by either the United States or  \n      foreign governments.                                      \n                                                                \nSuch risks generally depend on factors over which Citigroup has\nno control and which cannot be readily foreseen, such as:\n                        \n      economic events;  \n                        \n                             \n      political events; and  \n                             \n                                                               \n      the supply of, and demand for, the relevant currencies.  \n                                                               \nIn recent years, exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and some\nforeign currencies in which Citigroup\u0092s notes may be\ndenominated, and between these foreign currencies and other\nforeign currencies, have been volatile. This volatility may be\nexpected in the future. Fluctuations that have occurred in any\nparticular exchange rate in the past are not necessarily\nindicative, however, of fluctuations that may occur in the\nexchange rate during the term of any foreign currency note.\nDepreciation of the specified currency of a foreign currency\nnote against the U.S. dollar may result in a decrease in the\neffective yield of such foreign currency note below its interest\nrate and could result in a substantial loss to the investor on a\nU.S. dollar basis. Governments have imposed from time to time,\nand may in the future impose, exchange controls that could\naffect exchange rates as well as the availability of a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars at the time of payment of\nprincipal of, or premium (if any) or interest on, a foreign\ncurrency note. There can be no assurance that exchange controls\nwill not restrict or prohibit payments of principal, premium (if\nany) or interest or other amounts payable (if any) denominated\nin any such specified currency. Similarly, in the case of\nindexed notes and depending on the specific terms of the notes,\nfluctuations of the relevant underlying currencies could result\nin no return or in a substantial loss to the investor. Even if\nthere are no actual exchange controls, it is possible that such\nspecified currency would not be available to Citigroup when\npayments on a note are due because of circumstances beyond the\ncontrol of Citigroup. In this event, Citigroup will make\nrequired payments in U.S. dollars on the basis described in this\nprospectus supplement. You should consult your own financial and\nlegal advisors as to the risks of an investment in notes\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. See \u0093\u0097 The\nUnavailability of Currencies Could Result in a Substantial Loss\nto You\u0094 and \u0093Description of the Notes \u0097 Payment of Principal and\nInterest on Non-U.S. DollarNotes\u0094 below. The information set\nforth in this prospectus supplement is directed to prospective\npurchasers of notes who are United States residents, except\nwhere otherwise expressly noted. We cannot advise prospective\npurchasers who are residents of countries other than the United\nStates regarding any matters that may affect the purchase or S-1\n\nholding of, or receipt of payments of principal, premium or\ninterest on, notes. Such persons should consult their advisors\nwith regard to these matters. Any applicable supplement relating\nto notes having a specified currency other than U.S. dollars\nwill contain a description of any material exchange controls\naffecting such currency and any other required information\nconcerning such currency.

The amounts\nso payable on any date in such currency shall be converted into\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market\nexchange rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated in the\napplicable supplement. Any payment on such note made under such\ncircumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default or\nan event of default under the indenture under which such note\nwas issued. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement, if the specified currency of a note is officially\nredenominated, such as by an official redenomination of any such\nspecified currency that is a composite currency, then the\npayment obligations of Citigroup on such note will be the amount\nof redenominated currency that represents the amount of\nCitigroup\u0092s obligations immediately before the redenomination.\nThe notes will not provide for any adjustment to any amount\npayable under such notes as a result of:\n                                                                \n      any change in the value of the specified currency of      \n      such notes relative to any other currency due solely to   \n      fluctuations in exchange rates; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any redenomination of any component currency of any       \n      composite currency, unless such composite currency is     \n      itself                                                    \n      officially redenominated.                                 \n                                                                \nFor a description of the European Monetary Union, see \u0093European\nMonetary Union\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus and any\ndisclosure on the European Monetary Union in an applicable\nsupplement. Currently, there are limited facilities in the\nUnited States for conversion of U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies, and vice versa. In addition, banks do not generally\noffer non-U.S.dollar-denominated checking or savings account\nfacilities in the United States. Accordingly, payments on notes\nmade in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be made from an\naccount at a bank located outside the United States, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. Judgments in a\nForeign Currency Could Result in a Substantial Loss to You. The\nnotes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the\nlaws of New York State. Courts in the United States customarily\nhave not rendered judgments for money damages denominated in any\ncurrency other than the U.S. dollar. A 1987 amendment to the\nJudiciary Law of New York State provides, however, that an\naction based upon an obligation denominated in a currency other\nthan U.S. dollars will be rendered in the foreign currency of\nthe underlying obligation. Any judgment awarded in such an\naction will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of\nexchange prevailing on the date of the entry of the judgment or\ndecree. Additional risks specific to particular notes will be\ndetailed in the applicable pricing supplement, product\nsupplement and/or other supplement. S-2\n\nIMPORTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION\n\nPurchasers are required to pay for each note in the currency\nspecified by Citigroup for such note. If requested by a\nprospective purchaser of\na note having a specified currency other than U.S. dollars,\nCitigroup\u0092s exchange rate agent may at its discretion arrange\nfor the exchange of U.S. dollars into such specified currency to\nenable the purchaser to pay for such note. Each such\nexchange will be made by the exchange rate agent. The terms,\nconditions, limitations and charges that the exchange rate agent\nmay from time to time establish in accordance with its regular\nforeign exchange practice shall control the exchange. The\npurchaser must pay all costs of exchange.\n\nReferences in this prospectus supplement to \u0093U.S. dollars,\u0094\n\u0093U.S.$,\u0094\n\u0093dollar\u0094 or \u0093$\u0094 are to the lawful currency of the United States.\n\nS-3\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this prospectus supplement, the\naccompanying prospectus and in other information incorporated by\nreference in this\nprospectus are \u0093forward-looking statements\u0094 within the meaning\nof the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.

With respect to indexed\nprincipal notes, references to the payment of \u0093principal\u0094 in\nthis prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus (other\nthan the \u0093stated principal amount\u0094) in the context of the amount\npayable at stated maturity or earlier redemption or repayment\nare to the amount payable on such note at stated maturity or\nearlier redemption or repayment, as specified in the applicable\nsupplement, other than any interest payable at such time. Such\namount may be greater than, equal to or less than the stated\nprincipal amount of such note at issuance. A description of the\nindex used in any determination of the payment at maturity or an\ninterest payment, and the method or formula by which such\npayments will be determined based on such index, will be set\nforth in the applicable supplement. If a fixed rate note,\nfloating rate note or indexed rate note is also an indexed\nprincipal note, the amount of any interest payment will be\ndetermined based on the stated principal amount of such indexed\nnote unless specified otherwise in connection with a particular\noffering of notes. If an indexed rate note is also an indexed\nprincipal note, the amount payable at stated maturity or any\nearlier redemption or repayment of the indexed note may be\ndifferent from the stated principal amount. Unless otherwise set\nforth in the applicable supplement, the regular record date for\nany interest payment date for an indexed note will be the\nbusiness day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment\ndate. Unless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, for the purpose of determining whether\nholders of the requisite principal amount of notes outstanding\nunder the applicable indenture have made S-6\n\na demand or given a notice or waiver or taken any other action,\nthe outstanding principal amount of indexed notes will be deemed\nto be the stated principal amount of such notes. The interest\nrate on an indexed rate note will in no event be higher than the\nmaximum rate permitted by applicable law. The notes will be\ngoverned by the law of the State of New York. As of the date of\nthis prospectus supplement, the maximum rate of interest under\nprovisions of the New York penal law, with a few exceptions, is\n25% per annum on a simple interest basis. Such maximum rate of\ninterest only applies to obligations that have an aggregate\nprincipal amount that is less than $2,500,000. An investment in\nindexed notes has significant risks, including wide fluctuations\nin value prior to maturity and in the amounts of payments due,\nthat are not associated with a similar investment in a\nconventional debt security. Such risks depend on a number of\nfactors including supply and demand for the particular index (or\nthe components of the index, as applicable) to which the note is\nlinked and economic and political events over which Citigroup\nhas no control. Fluctuations in the price or level of any index\nthat have occurred in the past are not indicative of\nfluctuations that may occur during the term of any indexed\nnotes. Prospective investors should consult their own financial\nand legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in indexed\nnotes. Supplemental Provisions Relating to Non-U.S. DollarNotes\nPublic Offering Price The U.S. dollar equivalent of the public\noffering price or purchase price of a note having a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars will be determined on the basis\nof the market exchange rate. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of notes, this market\nexchange rate will be the noon buying rate in New York City for\ncable transfers in foreign currencies as certified for customs\npurposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for such\nspecified currency on the applicable issue date. Such\ndetermination will be made by Citigroup or its agent, as the\nexchange rate agent for the applicable offering of notes.\nPayment of Principal and Interest The applicable supplement for\na note may provide that Citigroup will make one or more payments\non such note in a currency other than U.S. dollars. If the\napplicable supplement provides for payment in a currency other\nthan U.S. dollars and the note is held by DTC as a global\nsecurity, Citigroup will, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, arrange to convert all payments in\nrespect of the note into U.S. dollars in the manner described in\nthe following paragraph. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of notes, the amount of\nany U.S. dollar payment on a note having a specified currency\nother than U.S. dollars that provides for payment in a currency\nother than U.S. dollars and that is held by DTC as a global\nsecurity will be determined by the exchange rate agent:\n                                                                \n      based on the specified currency/U.S. dollar exchange      \n      rate prevailing at 11:00 a.m., London, England time, on   \n      the                                                       \n      second exchange rate business day prior to the            \n      applicable payment date, or                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      if an exchange rate bid quotation is not so available,    \n      the exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from  \n      a                                                         \n      leading foreign exchange bank in London, England          \n      selected by the exchange rate agent after consultation    \n      with Citigroup.                                           \n                                                                \nThe exchange rate agent will also determine prior to settlement\nthe aggregate amount of the specified currency payable on a\npayment date for all notes denominated and payable in the\nspecified currency. All currency exchange costs will be deducted\nfrom payments to the holders of the notes. If no such bid\nquotations are available, the payments will be made in the\nspecified currency, unless the specified currency is unavailable\ndue to the imposition of exchange controls or due to other\ncircumstances beyond Citigroup\u0092s control. S-7\n\nExcept as set forth below, if payment on a note is required to\nbe made in a specified currency other than U.S. dollars and such\ncurrency is \u0097\n                                                                \n      unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls    \n      or other circumstances beyond Citigroup\u0092s control;         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      no longer used by the government of the country issuing   \n      such currency; or                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      no longer used for the settlement of transactions by      \n      public institutions of the international banking          \n      community\u00a0\u0097                                                \n                                                                \nthen all payments on such note will be made in U.S. dollars\nuntil such currency is again available or so used. The amounts\nso payable on any date in such currency shall be converted into\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market\nexchange rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated in the\napplicable supplement. Any payment on such note made under such\ncircumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default or\nan event of default under the indenture under which such note\nwas issued. If the specified currency of a note is officially\nredenominated, other than as a result of the European Monetary\nUnion, such as by an official redenomination of any such\nspecified currency that is a composite currency, then the\npayment obligations of Citigroup on such note will be the amount\nof redenominated currency that represents the amount of\nCitigroup\u0092s obligations immediately before the redenomination.\nThe notes will not provide for any adjustment to any amount\npayable under such notes as a result of:\n                                                                \n      any change in the value of the specified currency of      \n      such notes relative to any other currency due solely to   \n      fluctuations in exchange rates; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any redenomination of any component currency of any       \n      composite currency, unless such composite currency is     \n      itself                                                    \n      officially redenominated.                                 \n                                                                \nFor a description of the European Monetary Union, see \u0093European\nMonetary Union\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus and any\ndisclosure on the European Monetary Union in an applicable\nsupplement. Currently, there are limited facilities in the\nUnited States for conversion of U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies, and vice versa. In addition, banks do not generally\noffer non-U.S.dollar-denominated checking or savings account\nfacilities in the United States. Accordingly, payments on notes\nmade in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be made from an\naccount at a bank located outside the United States, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. Each note that\nhas a specified currency of pounds sterling will mature in\ncompliance with the regulations the Bank of England may\npromulgate from time to time. Alternative Book-Entry Procedures\nand Settlement If Citigroup issues notes which provide for one\nor more payments to be made in a non-U.S.currency, the\napplicable supplement may specify that such notes will be\ncleared through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\u0093Euroclear\u0094) and\nClearstream Banking, S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094), rather than through\nDTC. Such notes may be issued either under the New Safekeeping\nStructure (the \u0093NSS\u0094) or the Classic Safekeeping Structure (the\n\u0093CSS\u0094). Notes issued under the NSS will be registered in the\nname of a nominee of a common safekeeper for Euroclear and\nClearstream. Notes issued under the CSS will be registered in\nthe name of a nominee of a common depositary. Such common\nsafekeeper or common depositary, as applicable, will be the\ndepositary for such notes. The European Central Bank has\nannounced that notes issued under the NSS will be in compliance\nwith the \u0093Standards for the use of EU securities settlement\nsystems in ESCB credit operations\u0094 of the Eurosystem, provided\nthat certain other criteria are fulfilled. If such other\neligibility criteria are fulfilled, notes issued under the NSS\nwill be eligible to be pledged as collateral in Eurosystem\noperations (\u0093Eurosystem eligible\u0094). Notes issued under the CSS\nwill not be Eurosystem eligible. S-8\n\nSupplemental Provisions Relating to Floating Rate Notes Each\nfloating rate note will bear interest at the interest rate set\nforth, or otherwise described, in the applicable supplement. An\ninterest period is the period from each interest reset date to,\nbut not including, the following interest reset date; provided\nthat the initial interest period is the period from the original\nissue date to, but not including, the first interest reset date.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, each\ninterest payment date for a floating rate note will be an\ninterest reset date for that note. The interest rate for each\nfloating rate note will be determined based on a simple per\nannum, interest rate basis and will be equal to, the base rate,\nplus or minus any spread, or multiplied by any spread\nmultiplier. A basis point, or bp, equals one-hundredthof a\npercentage point. The spread is the number of basis points\nspecified in the applicable supplement. The spread multiplier is\nthe percentage specified in the applicable supplement and the\nspread multiplier on floating rate notes may be adjusted from\ntime to time. As specified in the applicable supplement, a\nfloating rate note may have either or both of the following,\nwhich will be expressed as a rate per annum on a simple interest\nrate basis:\n                                                                \n      maximum interest rate, which will be a maximum            \n      limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest     \n      may accrue                                                \n      during any interest period; and/or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      minimum interest rate, which will be a minimum            \n      limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest may   \n      accrue                                                    \n      during any interest period.                               \n                                                                \nIn addition to any maximum interest rate that may be applicable\nto any floating rate note, the interest rate on a floating rate\nnote will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted\nby applicable law. The notes will be governed by the law of the\nState of New York. As of the date of this prospectus supplement,\nthe maximum rate of interest under provisions of the New York\npenal law, with a few exceptions, is 25% per annum on a simple\ninterest basis. Such maximum rate of interest only applies to\nobligations that have an aggregate principal amount that is less\nthan $2,500,000. The interest rate on each floating rate note\nwill be reset on an interest reset date, which means that the\ninterest rate is reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,\nsemiannually or annually, as specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement:\n                                                                \n      if an interest reset date for any floating rate note      \n      would fall on a day that is not a business day, such      \n      interest reset date will be postponed to the next         \n      succeeding business day.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      in the case of a LIBOR note or a EURIBOR note, if         \n      postponement to the next business day would cause the     \n      interest                                                  \n      reset date to be in the next succeeding calendar month,   \n      the interest reset date will instead be the immediately   \n      preceding business day.                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      if an auction of direct obligations of United States      \n      Treasury bills falls on a day that is an interest reset   \n      date                                                      \n      for Treasury Rate notes, the interest reset date will be  \n      the succeeding business day.                              \n                                                                \nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement and\nexcept as set forth below, the rate of interest that goes into\neffect on any interest reset date will be determined on an\ninterest determination date preceding such interest reset date,\nas further described in the applicable supplement. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement, interest\npayable on floating rate notes will be the interest accrued from\nand including the original issue date or the last date to which\ninterest has been paid, as the case may be, to but excluding the\napplicable interest payment date. Accrued interest on a floating\nrate note with more than one interest reset date will be\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount of the note by an\naccrued interest factor. If the floating rate note is an indexed\nS-9\n\nnote, the stated principal amount of the note will be multiplied\nby the accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will\nbe computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each\nday in the period for which accrued interest is being\ncalculated. The interest factor for each such day will be\ncomputed by dividing the interest rate in effect on such day by\nthe number of days specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. The\ninterest factor will be expressed as a decimal calculated to\nseven decimal places without rounding. For purposes of making\nthe foregoing calculation, the interest rate in effect on any\ninterest reset date will be the applicable rate as reset on such\ndate.\n\nFor all other floating rate notes, accrued interest will be\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount of the note by\nthe\ninterest rate in effect during the period for which accrued\ninterest is being calculated. That product is then multiplied by\nthe quotient obtained by dividing the number of days in the\nperiod for which accrued interest is being calculated by the\nnumber of days specified in the applicable pricing supplement.\n\nUpon the request of the holder of any floating rate note, the\ncalculation\nagent for such note will provide the interest rate then in\neffect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become\neffective on the next interest reset date for such floating rate\nnote.\n\nNo Securities Exchange Listing\n\nUnless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\ndebt securities, the notes will not be listed on any U.S. or\ninternational securities exchange.\n\nNo Payment of Additional Amounts or Redemption for Tax Purposes\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\nCitigroup will not be obligated to pay additional amounts to the\nbeneficial owner of\nany notes that is a non-United States person, as described in\nthe accompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Payment of Additional Amounts.\u0094 Additionally,\nCitigroup will not have the right to redeem a series of notes\nfor tax purposes as described in the accompanying prospectus\nunder \u0093Description of Debt Securities \u0097 Redemption for Tax\nPurposes,\u0094 unless otherwise specified in\nthe applicable supplement.\n\nCombination of Provisions\n\nIf so specified in the applicable supplement, any note may be\nrequired to comply with all of the provisions, or any\ncombination of the\nprovisions, described herein or in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nOptional Redemption, Repayment and Repurchase\n\nIf so specified in the applicable supplement relating to a note,\nsuch note can be redeemed, with prior approval of the Federal\nReserve if\nrequired, at the option of Citigroup, in whole or in part, prior\nto its stated maturity. If applicable, such supplement will also\nindicate (1) the optional redemption date or dates on which such\nnote may be redeemed and (2) the\nredemption price at which such note may be redeemed on each such\noptional redemption date.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with\na particular offering of notes, at least 35 days prior to the\ndate of redemption, Citigroup will provide notice of such\nredemption to the trustee, and we or the trustee (at our\nrequest) will provide notice of such redemption to the holder of\nsuch\nnote (which shall be the depositary for so long as the notes are\nheld in book-entry form) in accordance with \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Book Entry Procedures and Settlement \u0097 Notices\u0094 in\nthe\naccompanying prospectus. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of notes, Citigroup may\nexercise such option relating to a redemption of a note in part\nonly by notifying the trustee for such note at least 35 days\nprior\nto any optional redemption date. In the event of redemption of a\nnote in part only, a new note or notes for the unredeemed\nportion of such note or\n\nS-10\n\nnotes will be issued to the holder of such note or notes upon\nthe cancellation of such note or notes. The redemption of any\ndebt security that is included in Citigroup\u0092s capital and total\nloss-absorbing capacity may be subject to consultation with the\nFederal Reserve, which may not acquiesce in the redemption of\nsuch note unless it is satisfied that the capital position and\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity of Citigroup will be adequate\nafter the proposed redemption. If so specified in the applicable\nsupplement relating to a note, the holder of such note will have\nthe option to elect repayment of such note by Citigroup prior to\nits stated maturity. If applicable, such supplement will specify\n(1) the optional repayment date or dates on which such note may\nbe repaid and (2) the optional repayment price at which such\nnote may be repaid on each such optional repayment date. Subject\nto the terms set forth in the applicable supplement, in order\nfor a note to be repaid, the trustee must receive, at least 35\ndays prior to an optional repayment date:\n                                                                \n       such note with the form entitled \u0093Option to Elect         \n  (1)  Repayment\u0094 on the reverse of such note duly               \n       completed; or                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, electronic    \n       mail correspondence or letter from a member of a         \n  (2)  national                                                 \n       securities exchange or the Financial Industry            \n       Regulatory Authority, Inc. or a commercial bank or       \n       trust company in the United States setting forth:        \n                                                                \n                                            \n      the name of the holder of such note;  \n                                            \n                                                       \n      the principal amount of such note to be repaid;  \n                                                       \n                                                                \n      the certificate number or a description of the tenor and  \n      terms of such note; and                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a statement that the option to elect repayment is being   \n      exercised.                                                \n                                                                \nAny tender of a note by the holder for repayment, except\npursuant to a reset notice or an extension notice, will be\nirrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the holder\nof a note for less than the entire principal amount of such\nnote, provided, that the stated principal amount of such note\nremaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized\ndenomination. Upon such partial repayment, such note will be\ncanceled and a new note or notes for the remaining stated\nprincipal amount will be issued in the name of the holder of\nsuch repaid note. If a note is represented by a global security,\nthe depositary\u0092s nominee will be the holder of such note and,\ntherefore, will be the only entity that can exercise a right to\nrepayment. In order to ensure that the depositary\u0092s nominee will\ntimely exercise a right to repayment relating to a particular\nnote, the beneficial owner of such note must instruct the broker\nor other direct or indirect participant through which it holds\nan interest in such note to notify the depositary of its desire\nto exercise a right to repayment. Different firms have different\ncut-offtimes for accepting instructions from their customers.\nAccordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or\nother direct or indirect participant through which it holds an\ninterest in a note in order to ascertain the cut-offtime by\nwhich such an instruction must be given in order for timely\nnotice to be delivered to the depositary. Except in the case of\nan optional redemption by Citigroup at a stated redemption price\nprovided for in the applicable supplement, if Citigroup redeems\nor repays a note that is an OID note other than an indexed note\nprior to its stated maturity, then Citigroup will pay the\namortized principal amount of the note as of the date of\nredemption or repayment regardless of anything else stated in\nthis prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. The\namortized principal amount of a note on any date means the\namount equal to:\n                                                                \n      the issue price set forth in the applicable supplement    \n      plus                                                      \n                                                                \nS-11\n                                                                \n      that portion of the difference between the issue price    \n      and the principal amount of the note that has accrued by  \n      that date at                                              \n                                                                \n(1) the bond yield to maturity set forth in the applicable\nsupplement, or (2) if so specified in the applicable supplement,\nthe bond yield to call set forth therein. These computations\nwill be made in accordance with generally accepted United States\nbond yield computation principles. However, the amortized\nprincipal amount of a note will never exceed its principal\namount. The bond yield to call listed in an applicable\nsupplement will be computed on the basis of:\n                                                                \n      the first occurring optional redemption date with         \n      respect to such note; and                                 \n                                                                \n                                                            \n      the amount payable on such optional redemption date.  \n                                                            \nIn the event that any such note is not redeemed on such first\noccurring optional redemption date, the bond yield to call that\napplies to such note will be recomputed on such optional\nredemption date on the basis of (1) the next occurring optional\nredemption date and (2) the amount payable on such optional\nredemption date. The bond yield to call will continue to be so\nrecomputed on each succeeding optional redemption date until the\nnote is so redeemed. Citigroup or any of its subsidiaries may at\nany time purchase notes at any price in the open market or\notherwise. Notes so purchased by Citigroup or any of its\nsubsidiaries may, at the discretion of Citigroup, be held,\nresold or surrendered to the trustee for such notes for\ncancellation.

S-12\n\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS The following is a\ndiscussion of the material U.S. federal income and certain\nestate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the\nnotes. It applies to you only if you purchase a note for cash in\nthe initial offering at the \u0093issue price,\u0094 which is the first\nprice at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the\npublic (not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar\npersons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,\nplacement agents or wholesalers), and hold it as a capital asset\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094). Purchasers of notes at another\ntime or price should consult their tax advisers regarding the\nU.S. federal tax consequences to them of the ownership and\ndisposition of the notes. This discussion does not address all\nof the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of\nyour particular circumstances or if you are a holder subject to\nspecial rules, such as:\n                                \n      a financial institution;  \n                                \n                                       \n      a \u0093regulated investment company\u0094;  \n                                       \n                                                               \n      a tax-exempt entity, including an \u0093individual retirement  \n      account\u0094 or \u0093Roth IRA\u0094;                                     \n                                                               \n                                                                \n      a dealer or trader subject to a                           \n      mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to   \n      the notes;                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a person holding a note as part of a \u0093straddle\u0094 or          \n      conversion transaction or one who enters into a           \n      \u0093constructive sale\u0094 with respect to a note;                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a person subject to special tax accounting rules under    \n      Section\u00a0451(b) of the Code;                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional         \n      currency is not the U.S. dollar; or                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal    \n      income tax purposes.                                      \n                                                                \nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes holds the notes, the U.S. federal\nincome tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the\nstatus of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If\nyou are a partnership holding the notes or a partner in such a\npartnership, you should consult your tax adviser as to the\nparticular U.S. federal tax consequences of holding and\ndisposing of the notes to you. This discussion is based on the\nCode, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and\nfinal, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of\nthe date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date\nof this prospectus supplement may affect the tax consequences\ndescribed herein, possibly with retroactive effect. This\ndiscussion does not address the effects of any applicable state,\nlocal or non-U.S.tax laws or the potential application of the\nMedicare contribution tax or the alternative minimum tax. You\nshould consult your tax adviser about the application of the\nU.S. federal income and estate tax laws (including the\npossibility of alternative treatments of the notes) to your\nparticular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising\nunder the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.jurisdiction. This\ndiscussion may be supplemented, modified or superseded by\ndisclosure regarding U.S. federal tax consequences set out in an\napplicable supplement, which you should read before making a\ndecision to invest in the relevant notes. Tax Treatment of the\nNotes This discussion applies to notes that we treat as debt\ninstruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S.\nfederal income tax treatment of other notes will be addressed in\nan applicable supplement. This discussion assumes that the notes\ndo not provide for payments determined by reference to equity\nsecurities. The treatment of such notes will be addressed in an\napplicable supplement. This disclosure generally applies to\nnotes that provide for payments solely in cash. Special tax\nconsequences may apply to notes that provide for one or more\npayments in property other than cash, and those consequences\nwill be addressed in an applicable supplement. S-13\n\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders This section applies only to\nU.S. Holders. You are a \u0093U.S. Holder\u0094 if for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes you are a beneficial owner of the notes that is:\n                                                              \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United States;  \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      a corporation created or organized in or under the laws   \n      of the United States, any state therein or the District   \n      of Columbia; or                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject to      \n      U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.    \n                                                                \nThe discussion below is subject to, and should be read in\nconjunction with, the discussion below under \u0093\u0097 Possible Taxable\nEvent.\u0094 Payments of Interest \u0093Qualified stated interest\u0094 on a\nnote (as described below under \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094)\ngenerally will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at\nthe time it accrues or is received in accordance with your\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSpecial rules governing the treatment of interest income on\ncertain categories of notes are described below under \u0093\u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated\nas Variable Rate Debt Instruments,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as\nContingent Payment Debt Instruments,\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as\nForeign Currency Debt Instruments.\u0094 Original Issue Discount A\nnote that has an \u0093issue price\u0094 that is less than its \u0093stated\nredemption price at maturity\u0094 will be treated as issued with\noriginal issue discount (\u0093OID\u0094) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes unless the discount is less than a de minimisthreshold\nunder applicable Treasury regulations. Special rules governing\nthe tax treatment of \u0093short-term notes\u0094 and \u0093contingent payment\ndebt instruments\u0094 (which are not subject to this discussion) are\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes,\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated\nas Contingent Payment Debt Instruments,\u0094 respectively. The\namount of OID will be equal to the excess of the stated\nredemption price at maturity over the issue price. The \u0093stated\nredemption price at maturity\u0094 of a note generally will equal the\nsum of all payments required under the note other than payments\nof \u0093qualified stated interest.\u0094 Qualified stated interest\n(\u0093QSI\u0094) generally includes stated interest unconditionally\npayable (other than in debt instruments of the issuer) at least\nannually at a single fixed rate, and also includes stated\ninterest on certain floating-rate notes (as described under \u0093\u0097\nNotes Treated as Variable Rate Debt Instruments\u0094 below). If a\nnote provides for more than one fixed rate of stated interest,\ninterest payable at the lowest stated rate generally is QSI,\nwith any excess included in the stated redemption price at\nmaturity for purposes of determining whether the note was issued\nwith OID. If the difference between a note\u0092s stated redemption\nprice at maturity and its issue price is less than a de\nminimisthreshold, as determined under applicable Treasury\nregulations, the note will not be treated as issued with OID and\ntherefore will not be subject to the rules described below. In\nthis case, all stated interest on the notes will be treated as\nQSI, and you will include the discount in income, as capital\ngain, on a pro rata basis as principal payments are made on the\nnote. If you hold notes issued with OID (\u0093OID notes\u0094), you will\nbe required to include any QSI in income when received or\naccrued, in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In addition, you will be required\nto include OID in income as it accrues, in accordance with a\nconstant-yield method based on a compounding of interest,\nregardless of your method of tax accounting. Under this method,\nyou will be required to include in ordinary income the sum of\nthe \u0093daily portions\u0094 of OID for all days during the taxable year\nthat you own the OID note. The daily portions of OID are\ndetermined by S-14\n\nallocating to each day in any accrual period a ratable portion\nof the OID on the OID note that is allocable to that period.\nAccrual periods may be any length and may vary in length over\nthe term\nof an OID note, so long as no accrual period is longer than one\nyear and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs\non the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID\nallocable to each accrual period is determined by\n(i) multiplying the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the OID note at\nthe beginning of the accrual period by the annual yield to\nmaturity of the OID note, adjusted to take account of the length\nof the accrual period, and (ii) subtracting\nfrom that product the amount of QSI allocable to that accrual\nperiod. The \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of an OID note at the\nbeginning of any accrual period will generally be the sum of its\nissue price and the amount of OID allocable to all\nprior accrual periods, reduced by the amount of payments other\nthan QSI in all prior accrual periods. The \u0093annual yield to\nmaturity\u0094 of an OID note is the discount rate that causes the\npresent value on the issue date of all payments on the\nnote to equal the issue price.\n\nYou may make an election to include in gross income all interest\nthat accrues on any note (including,\namong other things, QSI, OID and de minimis OID) in accordance\nwith the constant-yield method based on the compounding of\ninterest (a \u0093constant-yield election\u0094). This election may be\nrevoked only with the consent of the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094).\n\nA note that is subject to early redemption may be governed by\nrules that differ from the\ngeneral rules described above for purposes of determining its\nyield and maturity (which may affect whether the note is treated\nas issued with OID and, if so, the timing of accrual of the\nOID). Under applicable Treasury regulations, we will generally\nbe presumed to exercise an option to redeem a note if the\nexercise of the option would lower the yield on the note.\nConversely, you will generally be presumed to exercise an option\nto require us to repurchase a note if the exercise of the option\nwould increase the yield on the note. If such an option is not\nin fact exercised, the note would be treated, solely for\npurposes of calculating OID, as if it were redeemed and a new\nnote issued on the presumed exercise date for an amount equal to\nthe note\u0092s adjusted issue price on that date. If such a deemed\nreissuance occurs when the remaining term of the notes is one\nyear or less, it is possible that the note would thereafter be\ntreated as a short-term debt instrument. See\n\u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes\u0094 below.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium\n\nIf you purchase a note (other than a contingent payment debt\ninstrument, as described below under \u0093\u0097Notes Treated as\nContingent\nPayment Debt Instruments\u0094) for an amount that is greater than\nthe sum of all amounts payable on the note after the purchase\ndate, other than payments of QSI, you generally will be\nconsidered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond\npremium equal to such excess. If the note is not optionally\nredeemable prior to its maturity date, you generally may elect\nto amortize this premium over the remaining term of the note\nusing a constant-yield method. If, however, the note may be\noptionally redeemed prior to maturity after you have acquired\nit, the amount of amortizable bond premium is generally\ndetermined by substituting the redemption date for the maturity\ndate and the redemption price for the amount payable at maturity\nbut only if the substitution results in a smaller amount of\npremium attributable to the period before the redemption date.\nYou may generally use the amortizable bond premium allocable to\nan accrual period to offset QSI required to be included in\nyour income with respect to the note in that accrual period. If\nyou elect to amortize bond premium, you must reduce your tax\nbasis in the note by the amount of the premium amortized in any\nyear. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all\ntaxable debt instruments then owned or thereafter acquired and\nmay be revoked only with the consent of the IRS.\n\nIf you make a\nconstant-yield election (as described under \u0093\u0097 Original Issue\nDiscount\u0094 above) for a note with amortizable bond premium, that\nelection will result in a deemed election to amortize bond\npremium for all of your debt instruments\nwith amortizable bond premium.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note\n\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will\nrecognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between\nthe amount realized\nand your tax basis in the note. For this purpose, the amount\nrealized does\n\nS-15\n\nnot include any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid QSI,\nwhich will be treated as a payment of interest and taxed as\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Payments of Interest\u0094 above. Your\ntax basis in a note will equal its cost, increased by the\namounts of any OID you have previously accrued with respect to\nthe note, if any, and decreased by any amortized premium and any\nprincipal payments you received prior to the sale or other\ntaxable disposition of a note and by the amount of any other\npayments on the note that did not constitute QSI.\n\nGenerally, gain or loss\nrealized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a note\nwill be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if you have held the note for more than one year. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nExceptions to these general rules apply to short-term notes,\ncontingent payment debt instruments and foreign currency notes.\nSee \u0093\u0097Short-Term Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as Contingent Payment\nDebt Instruments\u0094 and\n\u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as Foreign Currency Debt Instruments\u0094 below.\n\nShort-Term Notes\n\nThe following discussion applies only to notes with a term of\none year or less, from but excluding the issue date to and\nincluding the last\npossible date that the notes could be outstanding pursuant to\ntheir terms (\u0093short-term notes\u0094). Generally, a short-term note\nis treated as issued at a discount equal to the sum of all\npayments required on the note minus its issue price.\n\nIf you are a cash-method U.S. Holder, you generally will not be\nrequired to recognize income with respect to a short-term note\nprior to\nmaturity, other than with respect to the receipt of interest\npayments, if any, or pursuant to a sale or other taxable\ndisposition of the note. If you are an accrual-method U.S.\nHolder (or a cash-method U.S. Holder who elects to accrue income\non the\nnote currently), you will be subject to rules that generally\nrequire accrual of discount on short-term notes on a straight-\nline basis, unless you elect a constant-yield method of accrual\nbased on daily compounding. In the case of short-term notes\nthat provide for one or more contingent payments, it is not\nclear whether or how any accrual should be determined prior to\nthe relevant valuation date for such a payment. You should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the amount and timing of any\naccruals on such notes.\n\nUpon a taxable disposition (including a sale, exchange, early\nredemption, or retirement) of a short-term note,\nyou will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount realized on the sale or other\ntaxable disposition and your tax basis in the note. Your tax\nbasis in the note should equal the amount you paid to acquire\nthe note\nincreased, if you accrue income on the notes currently, by any\npreviously accrued but unpaid discount. The amount of any\nresulting loss generally will be treated as a short-term capital\nloss, the deductibility of which is subject to limitations. The\nexcess of the amount received at maturity over your tax basis in\nthe note generally should be treated as ordinary income. If you\nsell a short-term note providing for a contingent payment at\nmaturity prior to the time the contingent payment has been\nfixed, it is not clear whether any gain you recognize should be\ntreated as ordinary income, short-term capital gain, or a\ncombination of ordinary income and short-term capital gain. You\nshould consult your tax adviser regarding the treatment of a\ntaxable disposition of short-term notes providing for contingent\npayments.\n\nIf you are a cash-method U.S. Holder, unless you make the\nelection to accrue income currently on a short-term note, you\nwill generally be required to defer deductions for interest paid\non indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the note in an\namount not exceeding the accrued discount that you have not\nincluded in income. As discussed above, in the case of a short-\nterm note providing for a contingent payment, it is unclear\nwhether or how accrual of discount should be determined prior to\nthe relevant valuation date in respect of the payment. If you\nmake the election to accrue income currently, that election will\napply to all short-term debt instruments acquired by you on or\nafter the first day of the first taxable year to which that\nelection applies. You should consult your tax adviser\nregarding these rules.\n\nNotes Treated as Variable Rate Debt Instruments\n\nThe following discussion applies only to floating-rate notes\nthat are treated as variable rate debt instruments for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes (\u0093VRDIs\u0094).\n\nS-16\n\nInterest on VRDIs That Provide for a Single Variable Rate.\nStated interest on a VRDI\nthat provides for a single variable rate (a \u0093single-rate VRDI\u0094)\nwill be treated as QSI and will be taxable to you as ordinary\ninterest income at the time it accrues or is received, in\naccordance with your method of tax accounting. If the\nstated principal amount of a single-rate VRDI exceeds its issue\nprice by at least a specifiedde minimis amount, this excess will\nbe treated as OID that you must include in income as it accrues\nin accordance with a\nconstant-yield method based on compounding of interest before\nthe receipt of cash payments attributable to this income (as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094). If a VRDI\nprovides for stated interest at a fixed rate\nfor an initial period of one year or less followed by a variable\nrate and the variable rate on the issue date is intended to\napproximate the fixed rate (which will be presumed if the value\nof the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from\nthe value of the fixed rate by more than 0.25%), the two rates\nwill be treated for purposes of this and the next paragraph as a\nsingle variable rate.\n\nInterest on VRDIs That Provide for Multiple Rates. This\ndiscussion refers to VRDIs that provide for (i) multiple\nvariable rates or\n(ii) one or more variable rates and a single fixed rate as\n\u0093multiple-rate VRDIs.\u0094 Under applicable Treasury regulations, in\norder to determine the amount of QSI and OID in respect of\nmultiple-rate VRDIs, an equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument must be constructed. The equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument is constructed in the following manner: (i) first, if\nthe multiple-rate VRDI contains a fixed rate, that fixed rate is\nconverted to a variable rate that preserves the\nfair market value of the note and (ii) second, each variable\nrate (including a variable rate determined under (i) above) is\nconverted to a fixed rate substitute (which will generally be\nthe value of that variable rate as of the issue date\nof the multiple-rate VRDI) (the \u0093equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument\u0094). The rules discussed in \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094\nare then applied to the equivalent fixed-rate debt instrument to\ndetermine the amount, if any,\nof OID and the timing of accrual of any OID. You will be\nrequired to include the OID in income for federal income tax\npurposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant-yield\nmethod based on compounding of interest, as described above\nunder\n\u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount.\u0094 QSI on a multiple-rate VRDI will\ngenerally be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the\ntime it accrues or is received, in accordance with your method\nof tax accounting. If a multiple-rate\nVRDI is not issued with OID, all stated interest on the\nmultiple-rate VRDI will be treated as QSI.\n\nIf the amount of interest you receive\nin a calendar year is greater than the interest assumed to be\npaid or accrued under the equivalent fixed-rate debt instrument,\nthe excess is generally treated as additional QSI taxable to you\nas ordinary income. Otherwise, any difference will\ngenerally reduce the amount of QSI you are treated as receiving\nand will therefore reduce the amount of ordinary income you are\nrequired to take into income.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of a VRDI. Upon the sale or\nother taxable disposition of a VRDI, you generally will\nrecognize capital\ngain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized\n(other than amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid QSI,\nwhich will be treated as a payment of interest) and your tax\nbasis in the VRDI. Your tax basis in a VRDI will equal the\namount you paid to purchase the VRDI, increased by the amounts\nof OID (if any) you previously included in income with respect\nto the VRDI, and reduced by any payments other than QSI you\nreceived and any amortized premium. Your gain or loss generally\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the VRDI for\nmore than one year at the time of disposition.\n\nNotes Treated as Contingent Payment Debt Instruments\n\nThe following discussion applies only to notes treated as\ncontingent payment debt instruments\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes (\u0093CPDIs\u0094).\n\nInterest Accruals on the CPDIs. We are required to determine a\n\u0093comparable yield\u0094 for each issuance of CPDIs. The \u0093comparable\nyield\u0094 is the yield at which we could issue a fixed-rate debt\ninstrument with terms similar to those of the CPDIs, including\nthe level of subordination, term, timing\nof payments and general market conditions, but excluding any\nadjustments for the riskiness of the contingencies or the\nliquidity of the CPDIs. Solely for purposes of determining the\namount of interest income that you will be required to accrue,\nwe\nare also required to construct a \u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 in\nrespect of the CPDIs representing a payment or a series\n\nS-17\n\nof payments the amount and timing of which would produce a yield\nto maturity on the CPDIs equal to the comparable yield. Neither\nthe comparable yield nor the projected payment schedule\nconstitutes a representation by us regarding the actual amounts\nthat we will pay on the CPDIs. For U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, you are required to use our determination of the\ncomparable yield and projected payment schedule in determining\ninterest accruals and adjustments in respect of the CPDIs,\nunless you timely disclose and justify the use of other\nestimates to the IRS. Regardless of your method of accounting\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to\naccrue, as interest income, OID on the CPDIs at the comparable\nyield, adjusted upward or downward to reflect the difference, if\nany, between the actual and the projected payments on the CPDIs\nduring the year (as described below). You will be required for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes to accrue an amount of OID, for\neach accrual period prior to and including the maturity (or\nearlier sale or other taxable disposition) of a CPDI, that\nequals the product of (i) the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the CPDI\n(as defined below) as of the beginning of the accrual period,\n(ii) the comparable yield of the CPDI, adjusted for the length\nof the accrual period and (iii) the number of days during the\naccrual period that you held the CPDI divided by the number of\ndays in the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a CPDI\nis its issue price increased by any interest income you have\npreviously accrued (determined without regard to adjustments due\nto differences between projected and actual payments) and\ndecreased by the projected amounts of any payments previously\nmade on the CPDI (without regard to actual amounts paid).\nAdjustments to Interest Accruals on the CPDIs. In addition to\ninterest accrued based upon the comparable yield as described\nabove, you will be required to recognize interest income equal\nto the amount of any net positive adjustment ( i.e., the excess\nof actual payments over projected payments) in respect of a CPDI\nfor a taxable year. A net negative adjustment ( i.e., the excess\nof projected payments over actual payments) in respect of a CPDI\nfor a taxable year:\n                                                                \n      will first reduce the amount of interest in respect of    \n      the CPDI that you would otherwise be required to include  \n      in income in the taxable year; and                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      to the extent of any excess, will give rise to an         \n      ordinary loss, but only to the extent that the amount of  \n      all                                                       \n      previous interest inclusions under the CPDI exceeds the   \n      total amount of the net negative adjustments treated as   \n      ordinary loss on the CPDI in prior taxable years.         \n                                                                \nA net negative adjustment is not treated as a miscellaneous\nitemized deduction (for which deductions would be unavailable\nor, beginning in 2026, available only to a limited extent). Any\nnet negative adjustment in excess of the amounts described above\nmay be carried forward to offset future interest income in\nrespect of the CPDI or to reduce the amount realized on a sale\nor other taxable disposition of the CPDI. Sale or Other Taxable\nDisposition of the CPDIs. Upon a sale or other taxable\ndisposition of a CPDI, you generally will recognize taxable\nincome or loss equal to the difference between the amount\nreceived and your tax basis in the CPDI. Your tax basis in the\nCPDI will equal your purchase price for the CPDI, increased by\nany interest income you have previously accrued (determined\nwithout regard to adjustments due to differences between\nprojected and actual payments) and decreased by the projected\namounts of any payments previously made on the CPDI (without\nregard to actual amounts paid). At maturity, you will be treated\nas receiving the projected amount for that date, and any\ndifference between the amount actually received and that\nprojected amount will be treated as a positive or negative\nadjustment governed by the rules described above under \u0093\u0097\nAdjustments to Interest Accruals on the CPDIs.\u0094 As described\nabove, the amount you are treated as receiving upon a\ndisposition of a CPDI, whether at or prior to maturity, will be\nreduced by any carryforward of a net negative adjustment. You\ngenerally must treat any income as interest income and any loss\nas ordinary loss to the extent of previous interest inclusions\n(reduced by the total amount of net negative adjustments\npreviously taken S-18\n\ninto account as ordinary losses), and the balance as capital\nloss. These losses are not treated as miscellaneous itemized\ndeductions. The deductibility of capital losses is, however,\nsubject to\nlimitations. Additionally, if you recognize a loss above certain\nthresholds, you may be required to file a disclosure statement\nwith the IRS, as described below under \u0093Reportable\nTransactions.\u0094 You should consult your tax adviser regarding\nthis reporting obligation.\n\nSpecial Rules for Contingent Payments that Fix Early. Special\nrules may apply if all the remaining\npayments on a CPDI become fixed substantially contemporaneously.\nFor this purpose, payments will be treated as fixed if the\nremaining contingencies with respect to them are remote or\nincidental. Under these rules, you would be required to account\nfor the difference between the originally projected payments and\nthe fixed payments in a reasonable manner over the period to\nwhich the difference relates. In addition, you would be required\nto make adjustments to, among other things, your accrual\nperiods and your tax basis in the CPDI. The character of any\ngain or loss on a sale or other taxable disposition of your CPDI\nalso might be affected. If one or more (but not all) contingent\npayments on a CPDI became fixed more than six months prior\nto the relevant payment dates, you would be required to account\nfor the difference between the originally projected payments and\nthe fixed payments on a present value basis. You should consult\nyour tax adviser regarding the application of these\nrules.\n\nNotes Treated as Foreign Currency Debt Instruments\n\nGeneral. The following discussion describes certain special\nrules applicable to you if you hold notes that are denominated\nin a single\nspecified currency other than the U.S. dollar or the payments of\ninterest and principal on which are payable in (or determined by\nreference to) a single specified currency other than the U.S.\ndollar, which we refer to as \u0093foreign currency\nnotes.\u0094 This discussion does not address currency-linked notes\nor foreign currency notes that provide for contingent payments\nor payments in or by reference to multiple currencies, which\nwill be discussed in an applicable supplement.\n\nThe rules applicable to notes that are denominated in a currency\nother than the U.S. dollar could require some or all of the gain\nor loss\nrealized upon a sale or other taxable disposition of the notes\nthat is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates\n(\u0093foreign currency gain or loss\u0094) to be treated as ordinary\nincome or loss. The rules applicable to foreign\ncurrency notes are complex, and their application may depend on\nyour circumstances. For example, various elections are available\nunder these rules, and whether you should make any of these\nelections may depend on your particular U.S. federal income\ntax situation. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and\ndisposition of foreign currency notes.\n\nPayments of Interest on Foreign Currency Notes. If you use the\ncash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nand\nreceive a payment of QSI (or proceeds from a sale or other\ntaxable disposition attributable to accrued QSI) in a foreign\ncurrency with respect to a foreign currency note, you will be\nrequired to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the\nforeign\ncurrency payment (determined based on a spot rate on the date\nthe payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in\nfact converted to U.S. dollars at that time, and this U.S.\ndollar value will be your tax basis in the foreign currency\nreceived. If you are a cash method holder and you receive a\npayment of QSI in U.S. dollars, you should include the amount of\nthis payment in income upon receipt. If you are a cash method\nholder and you are required to accrue OID on a foreign\ncurrency note, rules similar to the rules described in the\nfollowing paragraph will apply with respect to the OID.\n\nIf you use the accrual\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you\nwill be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of\nthe amount of interest income (including OID, but reduced by\namortizable bond premium to the extent applicable) that has\naccrued and is otherwise required to be taken into account with\nrespect to a foreign currency note during an accrual period. The\nU.S. dollar value of the accrued income will be determined by\ntranslating the income at an average rate of exchange for\nthe accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that\nspans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial\nperiod within the\n\nS-19\n\ntaxable year. In addition to the interest income accrued as\ndescribed above, you will recognize ordinary foreign currency\ngain or loss (which generally will not be treated as interest\nincome or\nexpense) with respect to accrued interest income on the date the\ninterest payment or proceeds from the sale, exchange or other\ndisposition attributable to accrued interest (or OID) is\nactually received. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss\nrecognized will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the foreign currency payment received (determined based\non a spot rate on the date the payment is received) in respect\nof the accrual period (or, where you receive U.S. dollars,\nthe amount of the payment in respect of the accrual period) and\nthe U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during\nthe accrual period (as determined above). You may elect to\ntranslate interest income (including OID) for an interest\naccrual period into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the last\nday of the interest accrual period (or, in the case of a partial\naccrual period, the last day of the taxable year) or, if the\ndate of receipt is within five business days of the last day\nof the interest accrual period, the spot rate on the date of\nreceipt. You must apply this election consistently to all debt\ninstruments from year to year and cannot change the election\nwithout the consent of the IRS.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium on Foreign Currency Notes. Amortizable\nbond premium on a foreign currency note is determined in the\nrelevant\nforeign currency.\n\nIf you elect to amortize bond premium, amortizable bond premium\ntaken into account on a current basis will reduce\ninterest income in units of the relevant foreign currency. You\nwill realize ordinary foreign currency gain or loss with respect\nto amortized bond premium with respect to any period by treating\nthat amortized bond premium in the same manner as a\nreturn of principal on the sale or other taxable disposition of\na foreign currency note (as discussed below). If the election is\nnot made, any loss realized on the sale, exchange or retirement\nof a foreign currency note will be capital loss to the\nextent of the bond premium.\n\nTax Basis in Foreign Currency Notes. Your tax basis in a foreign\ncurrency note, or the amount of any\nsubsequent adjustment to your tax basis, will be the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the foreign currency amount paid for the note, or of\nthe foreign currency amount of the adjustment, determined on the\ndate of the purchase or adjustment. If you purchase a\nforeign currency note with previously owned foreign currency,\nyou will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between your tax basis in the foreign\ncurrency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of the\nforeign currency note on the date of purchase.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of Foreign Currency Notes.\nForeign currency gain\nor loss recognized upon the sale or other taxable disposition\n(including retirement) of a foreign currency note will be\nordinary income or loss that generally is not treated as\ninterest income or expense. The amount of foreign currency gain\nor loss\ngenerally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar\nvalue of your purchase price (reduced by any bond premium\npreviously amortized as described above) in the foreign currency\nof the note, (i) determined on the date the payment is\nreceived in exchange for the note or the note is disposed of,\nand (ii) determined on the date you acquired the note. Amounts\nattributable to accrued but unpaid interest will be treated as\npayments of interest on foreign currency notes as\ndescribed above. Foreign currency gain or loss realized upon the\nsale or other taxable disposition of any foreign currency note\nwill be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss\nrealized on the sale or other taxable disposition of the\nforeign currency note. Any gain or loss realized in excess of\nthe foreign currency gain or loss will be capital gain or loss\n(except in the case of a short-term note, to the extent of any\ndiscount not previously included in your income). If you\nrecognize a loss upon a sale or other disposition of a foreign\ncurrency note above certain thresholds, you may be subject to\ncertain reporting requirements, as described below under\n\u0093Reportable Transactions.\u0094\n\nIf you are a cash-method taxpayer who buys or sells a foreign\ncurrency note that is traded on an established market, you will\nbe required to\ntranslate units of foreign currency paid or received into U.S.\ndollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase\nor sale. Accordingly, no exchange gain or loss will result from\ncurrency fluctuations between the trade date and the\nsettlement of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual-method\ntaxpayer, you may elect the same treatment for all purchases and\nsales of foreign currency obligations traded on established\nsecurities markets. This election cannot be changed without\nthe consent of the IRS. You\n\nS-20\n\nwill have a tax basis in any foreign currency received on the\nsale or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note\nequal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency,\ndetermined at the time of the sale or other taxable disposition.\nAny gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of foreign\ncurrency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its use to\npurchase foreign currency notes) will be ordinary income or\nloss. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S.Holders This section applies\nonly to Non-U.S.Holders. You are a \u0093Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 if for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note\nthat is:\n                                                               \n      an individual who is classified as a nonresident alien;  \n                                                               \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation; or  \n                                 \n                                  \n      a foreign trust or estate.  \n                                  \nYou are not a Non-U.S.Holder for purposes of this discussion if\nyou are (i) an individual who is present in the United States\nfor 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, or (ii)\na former citizen or resident of the United States and certain\nconditions apply. If you are or may become such a person during\nthe period in which you hold a note, you should consult your tax\nadviser regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the notes. The discussion below is subject to, and\nshould be read in conjunction with, the discussion below under \u0093\n\u0097 Possible Taxable Event.\u0094 Subject to the discussion below\nregarding \u0093FATCA,\u0094 you generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal withholding or income tax in respect of payments on or\namounts you receive on a sale or other taxable disposition of a\nnote, provided that (i) income in respect of the notes is not\neffectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business\nin the United States, and (ii) you provide an appropriate IRS\nForm W-8to the applicable withholding agent certifying under\npenalties of perjury that you are not a United States person. We\nwill not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect\nto U.S. federal withholding taxes. If you are engaged in a U.S.\ntrade or business, and if income from the notes is effectively\nconnected with your conduct of that trade or business, you\ngenerally will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax\nwith respect to that income in the same manner as if you were a\nU.S. Holder, subject to the provisions of an applicable income\ntax treaty. In that event, if you are a corporation, you should\nalso consider the potential application of a 30% (or lower\ntreaty rate) branch profits tax. U.S. Federal Estate Tax If you\nare an individual Non-U.S.Holder or an entity the property of\nwhich is potentially includible in such an individual\u0092s gross\nestate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a\ntrust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the\nindividual has retained certain interests or powers), you should\nnote that, absent an applicable treaty exemption, a note that is\ntreated as a debt obligation for U.S. federal estate tax\npurposes generally will be treated as U.S.-situs property\nsubject to U.S. federal estate tax if payments on the note, if\nreceived by the decedent at the time of death, would have been\nsubject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax (even if the\nIRS Form W-8certification requirement described above were\nsatisfied and not taking into account the elimination of such\nU.S. federal withholding tax due to the application of an income\ntax treaty). If you are such an individual or entity, you should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal estate tax\nconsequences of an investment in the notes. Possible Taxable\nEvent The designation of a substitute or successor rate or other\nsimilar circumstances resulting in a material change to the\nmethod by which amounts payable are determined on the notes\ncould result in a \u0093significant modification\u0094 of the affected\nnotes. S-21\n\nA significant modification would generally result in the notes\nbeing treated as terminated\nand reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that\nevent, you might be required to recognize gain or loss (subject\nto the possible application of the wash sale rules) with respect\nto the notes, and your holding period for your notes could be\naffected. Moreover, depending on the facts at the time of the\nsignificant modification, the reissued notes could be\ncharacterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a manner\ndifferent from their original treatment, which could have a\nsignificant and potentially adverse effect on the timing and\ncharacter of income you recognize with respect to the notes\nafter the significant modification if you are a U.S. Holder, and\npotentially adverse withholding consequences if you are a\nNon-U.S. Holder.\n\nYou should consult your tax adviser regarding the consequences\nof a significant\nmodification of the notes. Except where stated otherwise, the\ndiscussion herein assumes that there has not been a significant\nmodification of the notes.\n\nReportable Transactions\n\nA taxpayer that\nparticipates in a \u0093reportable transaction\u0094 is subject to\ninformation reporting requirements under Section 6011 of the\nCode. Reportable transactions include, among other things,\ncertain transactions identified by the IRS as well as\ncertain losses recognized in an amount that exceeds a specified\nthreshold level.\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\nPayments on the notes, and the proceeds of a sale, exchange or\nother disposition (including retirement) of the notes, may be\nsubject to\ninformation reporting and, if you fail to provide certain\nidentifying information (such as an accurate taxpayer\nidentification number if you are a U.S. Holder) or meet certain\nother conditions, may also be subject to backup withholding at\nthe rate\nspecified in the Code. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder that\nprovides an appropriate IRS Form W-8, you will generally\nestablish an exemption from backup withholding. Amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional\ntaxes and may be refunded or credited against your U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided the relevant information is\ntimely furnished to the IRS.\n\nFATCA\n\nLegislation commonly referred to\nas \u0093FATCA\u0094 generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on\npayments to certain non-U.S. entities (including financial\nintermediaries) with respect to certain financial instruments,\nunless various U.S.\ninformation reporting and due diligence requirements (that are\nin addition to, and potentially significantly more onerous than,\nthe requirement to deliver an IRS Form W-8) have been satisfied.\nAn\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and the\nnon-U.S. entity\u0092s jurisdiction may modify these requirements.\nThis legislation generally applies to interest on the notes.\nWhile existing\nTreasury regulations would also require withholding on payments\nof gross proceeds of the disposition (including upon retirement)\nof the notes, the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated in\nsubsequent proposed regulations its intent to eliminate this\nrequirement. The U.S. Treasury Department has stated that\ntaxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations pending their\nfinalization. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder, or a U.S. Holder\nholding notes through a non-U.S. intermediary, you should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of\nFATCA to the notes, including the availability of certain\nrefunds or credits.\n\nS-22\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe notes are being offered on a continuous basis by Citigroup\nthrough Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as lead agent, and may be\noffered\nthrough additional or other agents named in the applicable\nsupplement. The agent or agents participating in a particular\noffering of the notes and named in the applicable supplement are\ncollectively referred to as the \u0093agent.\u0094 The agent\nhas agreed to use reasonable efforts to solicit orders to\npurchase notes. Citigroup will have the sole right to accept\norders to purchase notes and may reject proposed purchases in\nwhole or in part. The agent will also have the right to reject\nany\nproposed purchase in whole or in part. Citigroup reserves the\nright to withdraw, cancel or modify the offer made by this\nprospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus or any other\nsupplement without notice.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, the agent, acting as principal, will purchase\nthe aggregate\nstated principal amount of the notes offered at the public\noffering price stated in the applicable supplement less an\nunderwriting discount stated in the applicable supplement. The\nagent may sell the notes to the public at the public offering\nprice\nor to selected dealers, which may include affiliates of ours\nand/or the agent, at the public offering price less a selling\nconcession described in the applicable supplement. If so\nspecified in the applicable supplement, the agent may sell the\nnotes\nto the public or to selected dealers at varying prices to be\ndetermined at the time of each sale, which may be at prevailing\nmarket prices, at prices related to such prevailing prices or at\nnegotiated prices. After any initial public offering of\nnotes to be resold to purchasers at a fixed public offering\nprice, the public offering price and any concession or discount\nmay be changed.\n\nCitigroup reserves the right to sell notes directly to investors\non its own behalf. No commission will be payable nor will a\ndiscount be\nallowed on any sales made directly by Citigroup.\n\nUnless notes are issued upon the reopening of a prior offering\nof notes that were listed\non an exchange, no note will have an established trading market\nwhen issued. Unless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of notes, the notes will not be listed on\nany securities exchange. The agent may make a market in the\nnotes but is not obligated to do so. If the agent does make a\nmarket for a period of time, it may discontinue any market-\nmaking at any time without notice, at its sole discretion. There\ncan be no assurance of the existence or liquidity of a\nsecondary market for any notes.\n\nCitigroup estimates that its printing, rating agency, trustees\u0092\nand legal fees and other expenses\nallocable to the offering of the notes, excluding underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions, will be approximately $4,500,000.\n\nThe agent may\nbe deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act of 1933. Citigroup has agreed to indemnify the\nagent against liabilities relating to material misstatements and\nomissions, or to contribute to payments that the agent may be\nrequired to make relating to these liabilities. Citigroup will\nreimburse the agent for customary legal and other expenses\nincurred by it in connection with the offer and sale of the\nnotes.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, payment of the purchase price of the notes\nwill be required to\nbe made in immediately available funds in New York City on the\ndate of settlement.\n\nConcurrently with the offering of notes through the\nagent as described in this prospectus supplement, Citigroup may\nissue other securities under the indentures referred to in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nA portion of the net proceeds from the sale of indexed notes or\nfloating rate notes may be used to hedge Citigroup\u0092s obligations\nunder\nthe notes. Citigroup may hedge its obligations under the notes\nthrough an affiliate of Citigroup and Citigroup Global Markets\nInc. or through unaffiliated counterparties, and such\ncounterparties may profit from such expected hedging activity\neven if\nthe value of the notes declines. This hedging activity could\naffect the level or price of the index or base rate to which\nsuch notes are linked and, therefore, the value of and your\nreturn on the notes. For more information, see the section\n\u0093Use of Proceeds and Hedging\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus and\nthe applicable Pricing Supplement.\n\nS-23\n\nConflicts of Interest. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nand other broker-dealer subsidiaries of Citigroup, are members\nof the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u0093FINRA\u0094)\nand may participate in offerings of the notes. Accordingly,\nofferings of the notes in which Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. or Citigroup\u0092s other broker-dealer subsidiaries\nparticipate will conform with the requirements addressing\nconflicts of interest when distributing the securities of an\naffiliate set forth in FINRA Rule 5121. Neither Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. nor any other broker-dealer subsidiary of Citigroup\nwill sell notes to an account over which Citigroup or its\nsubsidiaries have investment discretion unless Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. or such broker-dealer subsidiary has received\nspecific written approval of the transaction from the account\nholder.\n\nAny agent, underwriter or dealer that is not an affiliate of\nours\nmay presently or from time to time engage in business\ntransactions with us, including extending loans to us.\n\nThis prospectus supplement,\nthe accompanying prospectus and each other applicable supplement\nmay be used by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or other\nsubsidiaries of Citigroup in connection with offers and sales of\nthe notes offered by this prospectus supplement in market-making\ntransactions at negotiated prices related to prevailing market\nprices at the time of sale. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or\nthese other subsidiaries may act as principal or agent in such\ntransactions.\n\nA prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the\nwebsites maintained by the agent or one or more other dealers.\nThe agent and\nother dealers may agree to allocate a number of notes for sale\nto their online brokerage account holders. The agent and other\ndealers will allocate notes to the agent and dealers that may\nmake Internet distributions on the same basis as other\nallocations. In addition, notes may be sold by the agent or\nother dealers to dealers who resell notes to online brokerage\naccount holders.\n\nCertain Selling Restrictions\n\nBolivia\n\nThe\noffshore notes are not governed by Bolivian legislation nor are\nthey registered with or regulated by the Bolivian regulatory\nauthorities.\n\nBrazil\n\nThe notes have not been and will not be issued or publicly\nplaced, distributed, offered or negotiated in the Brazilian\ncapital\nmarkets. None of Citigroup and the issuance of any notes have\nbeen or will be registered with the Comiss\u00e3o de Valores\nMobili\u00e1rios (\u0093CVM\u0094) (Brazilian Securities Commission). Any\npublic offering or distribution, as defined\nunder Brazilian laws and regulations, of notes in Brazil is not\nlegal without prior registration under Law No. 6,385, of 7\nDecember 1976, as amended, and Instruction No. 400, issued by\nthe CVM on 29 December 2003, as amended.\nDocuments relating to the offering of any notes, as well as\ninformation contained therein, may not be supplied to the public\nin Brazil (as the offering of any such notes is not a public\noffering of securities in Brazil), nor be used in connection\nwith any offer for subscription or sale of notes to the public\nin Brazil. Therefore, the agent has represented, warranted and\nagreed that it will not offer or sell notes in the Federative\nRepublic of Brazil except in circumstances which do not\nconstitute a public offering or distribution under Brazilian\nlaws and regulations.\n\nChile\n\nThe notes are being offered as of the date hereof solely to\nQualified Investors (Inversionistas Calificados) pursuant to the\nprivate\nplacement exemption provided by General Rule No. 336 of the\nSuperintendencia de Valores Y Seguros (the \u0093SVS\u0094). The offering\nof the notes has not been and will not be registered with the\nChilean Securities Registry or the Registry of\nForeign Securities of the SVS and, therefore, the notes are not\nsubject to oversight by the SVS and may not be sold publicly in\nChile. The issuer of the notes is not obligated to make\ninformation available publicly in Chile regarding the notes. The\nnotes may not be subject to a public offer until they are\nregistered in the corresponding Securities Registry.\n\nS-24\n\nEuropean Economic Area In relation to each Member State of the\nEuropean Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus\nDirective (each, a \u0093Member State\u0094), with effect from and\nincluding the date on which the Prospectus Directive is\nimplemented in that Member State, the notes have not been and\nwill not be offered to the public (the \u0093Securities\u0094) in that\nMember State other than:\n                                                                \n  (i)  to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as     \n       defined in the Prospectus Directive;                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than  \n        qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus        \n  (ii)  Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus           \n        Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of    \n        any agent for any such offer; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  (iii)  in any other circumstances falling within Article      \n         3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,                      \n                                                                \nprovided that no such offer of Securities shall require\nCitigroup or any agent to publish a prospectus pursuant to\nArticle 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus\npursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive. For the\npurposes of this provision, the expression an \u0093offer to the\npublic\u0094 in relation to any Securities in any Member State means\nthe communication in any form and by any means of sufficient\ninformation on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be\noffered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or\nsubscribe for the Securities, as the same may be varied in that\nMember State by any measure implementing the Prospectus\nDirective in that Member State, and the expression \u0093Prospectus\nDirective\u0094 means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, including by\nDirective 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant implementing\nmeasure in each Member State. This European Economic Area\nselling restriction is in addition to any other selling\nrestrictions set out in this prospectus supplement and any other\napplicable supplement. The accompanying prospectus and this\nprospectus supplement have been prepared, and each other\napplicable supplement will be prepared, on the basis that any\noffer of notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to an\nexemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to\npublish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly any person\nmaking or intending to make an offer in that Member State of\nnotes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the\naccompanying prospectus, this prospectus supplement and each\nother applicable supplement may only do so in circumstances in\nwhich no obligation arises for Citigroup or any agent to publish\na prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive\nin relation to such offer. Neither Citigroup nor any agent have\nauthorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of\nnotes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for\nCitigroup or any agent to publish a prospectus for such offer.\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region The contents of the\naccompanying prospectus, this prospectus supplement and each\nother applicable supplement have not been reviewed by any\nregulatory authority in the Hong Kong Special Administrative\nRegion of the People\u0092s Republic of China (\u0093Hong Kong\u0094).\nInvestors are advised to exercise caution in relation to the\noffer.

This prospectus supplement and any other offering\nmaterials may not be publicly distributed in Mexico. Peru The\nnotes may only be placed privately in Peru, except if such\noffering is considered a private offering under the securities\nlaws and regulations of Peru.

S-27\n\nBENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee\nbenefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as\namended (\u0093ERISA\u0094), including entities such as collective\ninvestment funds, partnerships and separate accounts whose\nunderlying assets include the assets of such plans\n(collectively, \u0093ERISA Plans\u0094), should consider the fiduciary\nstandards of ERISA in the context of the ERISA Plan\u0092s particular\ncircumstances before authorizing an investment in the notes.\nAmong other factors, the fiduciary should consider whether the\ninvestment would satisfy the prudence and\ndiversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent\nwith the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan.\n\nSection 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, (the \u0093Code\u0094) prohibit ERISA Plans,\nas well as plans (including individual retirement accounts and\nKeogh plans) subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together with\nERISA Plans, \u0093Plans\u0094), from engaging in certain transactions\ninvolving \u0093plan assets\u0094 with persons\nwho are \u0093parties in interest\u0094 under ERISA or \u0093disqualified\npersons\u0094 under Section 4975 of the Code (in either case,\n\u0093Parties in Interest\u0094) with respect to such Plans. As a result\nof our business, we, and our\ncurrent and future affiliates, may be Parties in Interest with\nrespect to many Plans. Where we (or our affiliate) are a Party\nin Interest with respect to a Plan (either directly or by reason\nof our ownership interests in our directly or indirectly\nowned subsidiaries), the purchase and holding of the notes by or\non behalf of the Plan could be a prohibited transaction under\nSection 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless\nexemptive relief were available under an applicable\nexemption (as described below).\n\nCertain prohibited transaction class exemptions (\u0093PTCEs\u0094) issued\nby the U.S. Department of\nLabor may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect\nprohibited transactions resulting from the purchase or holding\nof the notes. Those class exemptions are PTCE 96-23 (for certain\ntransactions determined\nby in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain\ntransactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE\n91-38 (for\ncertain transactions involving bank collective investment\nfunds), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance\ncompany separate accounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for\ncertain transactions determined by independent qualified\nprofessional asset managers). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of\nERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may provide a limited\nexemption for the purchase and sale of the notes and\nrelated lending transactions, provided that neither the issuer\nof the notes nor any of its affiliates have or exercise any\ndiscretionary authority or control or render any investment\nadvice with respect to the assets of the Plan involved in\nthe transaction and provided further that the Plan pays no more,\nand receives no less, than adequate consideration in connection\nwith the transaction (the so-called \u0093service provider\nexemption\u0094). There can be no assurance that any of these\nstatutory or class exemptions will be available with respect to\ntransactions involving the notes.\n\nAccordingly, the notes may not be purchased or held by any Plan,\nany entity whose underlying assets include \u0093plan assets\u0094 by\nreason\nof any Plan\u0092s investment in the entity (a \u0093Plan Asset Entity\u0094)\nor any person investing \u0093plan assets\u0094 of any Plan, unless such\npurchaser or holder is eligible for the exemptive relief\navailable under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 or the\nservice\nprovider exemption or there is some other basis on which the\npurchase and holding of the notes will not constitute a non-\nexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the\nCode. Each\npurchaser or holder of the notes or any interest therein will be\ndeemed to have represented by its purchase or holding of the\nnotes that (a) it is not a Plan and its purchase and holding of\nthe notes is not made on behalf of or with \u0093plan\nassets\u0094 of any Plan or (b) its purchase and holding of the notes\nwill not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under\nSection 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.\n\nCertain governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of\nERISA), church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and\nnon-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (\u0093Non-\nERISA Arrangements\u0094) are not subject to these \u0093prohibited\ntransaction\u0094 rules of ERISA\nor Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules\nunder other applicable laws or regulations (\u0093Similar Laws\u0094).\nAccordingly, each such purchaser or holder of the notes shall be\nrequired to represent (and deemed to have\nrepresented by its purchase or holding of the notes) that such\npurchase and holding is not prohibited under applicable Similar\nLaws.\n\nS-28\n\nDue to the complexity of these rules, it is particularly\nimportant that fiduciaries or other\npersons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of or with\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 of any Plan consult with their counsel regarding\nthe relevant provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws\nand the availability of exemptive relief under PTCE\n96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1, 84-14, the service\nprovider exemption or some other basis on which the acquisition\nand holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited\ntransaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a\nviolation of any applicable\nSimilar Laws.\n\nThe notes are contractual financial instruments. The financial\nexposure provided by the notes is not a substitute or proxy\nfor, and is not intended as a substitute or proxy for,\nindividualized investment management or advice for the benefit\nof any purchaser or holder of the notes. The notes have not been\ndesigned and will not be administered in a manner intended to\nreflect the individualized needs and objectives of any purchaser\nor holder of the notes.\n\nEach purchaser and holder of the notes has\nexclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding\nand subsequent disposition of the notes does not violate the\nfiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or\nany applicable Similar Laws. The sale of any notes to any\nPlan or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation\nby us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an\ninvestment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to\ninvestments by\nPlans or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan\nor Non-ERISA Arrangement, or that such an investment is\nappropriate for Plans or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any\nparticular Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement.\n\nHowever, individual retirement accounts, individual retirement\nannuities and Keogh plans, as well as employee benefit plans\nthat permit\nparticipants to direct the investment of their accounts, will\nnot be permitted to purchase or hold the notes if the account,\nplan or annuity is for the benefit of an employee of Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc. or a family member and the employee\nreceives any compensation (such as, for example, an addition to\nbonus) based on the purchase of notes by the account, plan or\nannuity.\n\nS-29\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nCertain legal matters with respect to the validity of the notes\nwill be passed upon for Citigroup by Barbara Politi, Associate\nGeneral\nCounsel \u0097 Capital Markets of Citigroup, Davis Polk & Wardwell\nLLP, special products counsel to Citigroup, and/or other counsel\nidentified in the applicable supplement.

Generally, forward-looking statements are\nnot based on historical facts but instead represent\nCitigroup\u0092s and its management\u0092s beliefs regarding future\nevents. Such statements may be identified by words such as\nbelieve, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase,\nmay fluctuate, targetandillustrative,and\nsimilar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as\nwill, should, wouldand could.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u0092s current expectations and are subject to risks,\nuncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results and\ncapital and other financial conditions may differ materially\nfrom those included in these statements due to a variety of\nfactors, including without limitation the precautionary\nstatements included in this prospectus and the accompanying\nprospectus supplement, and the factors and uncertainties\nsummarized under \u0093Forward-Looking Statements\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s\nmost recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and the factors listed and described under \u0093Risk\nFactors\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s most\nrecent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q. Precautionary statements included in such filings should\nbe read in conjunction with this prospectus\nand the accompanying prospectus supplement. Any forward-\nlooking statements made by or on behalf of Citigroup speak\nonly as to the date they are made, and Citigroup does not\nundertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the\nimpact of\ncircumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-\nlooking statements were made.\n\nCITIGROUP INC.\n\nCitigroup Inc. is a global diversified financial services\nholding company whose businesses provide consumers,\ncorporations,\ngovernments and institutions with a broad, yet focused range\nof financial products and services, including consumer banking\nand credit, corporate and investment banking, securities\nbrokerage, trade and securities services and wealth\nmanagement.\nCitigroup has approximately 200 million customer accounts and\ndoes business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.\nCitigroup currently operates, for management reporting\npurposes, via two primary business segments: Global Consumer\nBanking and Institutional Clients Group, with the remaining\noperations in Corporate/Other. Its businesses conduct their\nactivities across the North America, Latin America, Asia and\nEurope, Middle East and Africa regions.\nCitigroup\u0092s principal subsidiaries are Citibank, N.A.,\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. and Grupo Financiero\nCitibanamex, S.A. de C.V., each of which is a wholly owned,\nindirect subsidiary of Citigroup. Citigroup was incorporated\nin 1988 under the\nlaws of the State of Delaware as a corporation with perpetual\nduration.\n\nCitigroup is a holding company and services its obligations\nprimarily by earnings from its operating subsidiaries.\nCitigroup may augment its capital through issuances of common\nstock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and equity\nissued through awards under employee benefits plans, among\nother\nissuances. Citigroup and Citigroup\u0092s subsidiaries that operate\nin the banking and securities businesses can only pay\ndividends if they are in compliance with the applicable\nregulatory requirements imposed on them by federal and state\nbank\nregulatory authorities and securities regulators. Citigroup\u0092s\nsubsidiaries may be party to credit agreements that also may\nrestrict their ability to pay dividends. Citigroup currently\nbelieves that none of these regulatory or contractual\nrestrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay\ndividends will affect Citigroup\u0092s ability to service its own\ndebt. Citigroup must also maintain the required capital levels\nof a bank holding company. Under capital regulations,\nCitigroup\nmust submit a capital plan, subjected to stress testing, to\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n\u0093Federal Reserve\u0094) and have its stress capital buffer\ndetermined annually, before it may pay dividends on its stock.\n\nCitigroup is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u0093Dodd-Frank\nAct\u0094) and\nthe rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal Reserve to\nperiodically submit a\n\n6\n\nplan for Citigroup\u0092s rapid and orderly resolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. On December 17, 2019, the Federal Reserve\nand\nFDIC issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on July 1,\n2019 by the eight U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks,\nincluding Citigroup. The Federal Reserve and FDIC identified\none shortcoming, but no deficiencies, in Citigroup\u0092s\nresolution plan relating to governance mechanisms. Based on\nregulatory changes effective December 31, 2019, Citigroup\u0092s\nJuly 2021 resolution plan submission will be a \u0093targeted\u0094\nresolution plan, only including a subset of the\ninformation of a full resolution plan, as identified by the\nFederal Reserve and FDIC. Citigroup will alternate between a\nsubmitting a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution\nplan on a biennial cycle. On July 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nand FDIC provided information to the eight largest domestic\nbanking organizations, including Citigroup, required to be\nincluded in the targeted resolution plans due on July 1, 2021.\nFor additional information on Citigroup\u0092s resolution plan\nsubmissions, see \u0093Managing Global Risk\u0097Liquidity\nRisk\u0097Resolution Plan\u0094 in Citigroup\u0092s most recent Annual Report\non Form 10-K. Citigroup\u0092s preferred resolution strategy is\n\u0093single point of entry\u0094 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nUnder Citigroup\u0092s preferred \u0093single point of entry\u0094\nresolution plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding\ncompany, would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup\u0092s\nmaterial legal entities (as defined in the public section of\nits 2019 resolution plan, which can be found on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC\u0092s websites) would remain operational and\noutside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings. Citigroup\nbelieves its resolution plan has been designed to minimize the\nrisk of systemic impact to the U.S. and global\nfinancial systems, while maximizing the value of the\nbankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup\u0092s creditors,\nincluding the holders of the securities being offered by this\nprospectus. In addition, in line with the Federal Reserve\u0092s\nfinal total loss-absorbing capacity rule, Citigroup believes\nit has developed the resolution plan so that Citigroup\u0092s\nshareholders and unsecured creditors\u0097including the holders of\nthe securities being offered by this prospectus\u0097bear\nany losses resulting from Citigroup\u0092s bankruptcy. Accordingly,\nany value realized by holders of the holders of the securities\nbeing offered by this prospectus may not be sufficient to\nrepay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of\na bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.\nClaims of holders of the debt securities offered by this\nprospectus and other debt securities of Citigroup would have a\njunior position to the claims of creditors of Citigroup\u0092s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by\nstatute) and secured creditors of Citigroup. Accordingly, in a\nresolution of Citigroup under Chapter 11 of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, holders of the debt securities offered by\nthis\nprospectus and other debt securities of Citigroup would\nrealize value only to the extent available to Citigroup as a\nshareholder of its subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of Citigroup have been fully\nrepaid. If\nCitigroup were to enter into a resolution, none of Citigroup,\nthe Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nCitigroup\u0092s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution\nplan.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in response to feedback received from\nthe Federal Reserve and FDIC, Citigroup took the following\nactions:\n                                                                \n       Citicorp LLC (\u0093Citicorp\u0094), an existing wholly owned        \n  (i)  subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an           \n       intermediate holding company for certain of Citigroup\u0092s   \n       operating material legal entities;                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with    \n        Citicorp, Citigroup\u0092s operating material legal           \n        entities and certain other affiliated entities          \n  (ii)  pursuant to which Citicorp is required to provide       \n        liquidity and capital support to Citigroup\u0092s operating   \n        material legal entities in the event Citigroup were to  \n        enter bankruptcy proceedings (the                       \n        \u0093Citi Support Agreement\u0094);                                \n                                                                \n                                                  \n  (iii)  pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:  \n                                                  \n                                                                \n      Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets,         \n      including certain high-quality liquid assets and          \n      inter-affiliate loans (\u0093Contributable Assets\u0094), to          \n      Citicorp, and Citicorp became the business as usual       \n      funding vehicle for Citigroup\u0092s operating material legal   \n      entities;                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer       \n      Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject to    \n      certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among other     \n      things, meet Citigroup\u0092s near-term cash needs;             \n                                                                \n7\n                                                                \n      in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will    \n      be required to contribute most of its remaining assets    \n      to                                                        \n      Citicorp; and                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under    \n  (iv)  the Citi Support Agreement, as well as the              \n        Contributable                                           \n        Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.   \n                                                                \nThe Citi Support Agreement provides two mechanisms, besides\nCiticorp\u0092s issuing of dividends to Citigroup, pursuant to which\nCiticorp will be required to transfer cash to Citigroup during\nbusiness as usual so that Citigroup can fund its debt service as\nwell as other operating needs: (i) one or more\nfunding notes issued by Citicorp to Citigroup and (ii) a\ncommitted line of credit under which Citicorp may make loans to\nCitigroup.\n\nIn addition to Citigroup\u0092s required resolution plan under Title\nI of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II of the Dodd- Frank Act grants\nthe FDIC\nthe authority, under certain circumstances, to resolve\nsystemically important financial institutions, including\nCitigroup. This resolution authority is commonly referred to as\nthe FDIC\u0092s \u0093orderly liquidation authority.\u0094 Under the\nFDIC\u0092s stated preferred \u0093single point of entry\u0094 strategy for\nsuch resolution, the bank holding company (Citigroup) would be\nplaced in receivership; the unsecured long-term debt and\nshareholders of the parent holding company would bear\nany losses; the FDIC would use its power to create a \u0093bridge\nentity\u0094 for Citigroup; transfer the systemically important and\nviable parts of its business, principally the stock of\nCitigroup\u0092s main operating subsidiaries and any\nintercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge\nentity; and recapitalize the operating subsidiaries using assets\nof Citigroup that have been transferred to the bridge entity and\nexchange external debt claims against Citigroup for equity\nin the bridge entity. Under this Title II resolution strategy,\nthe value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be\nredistributed to holders of the debt securities offered by use\nof this prospectus and other debt securities of Citigroup\nmay not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal\namount and interest on the debt securities and those other\nsecurities. Any of the securities being offered by this\nprospectus may be fully subordinated to interests held by the\nU.S.\ngovernment in the event of a receivership, insolvency,\nliquidation or similar proceeding with respect to Citigroup,\nincluding a proceeding under the \u0093orderly liquidity authority\u0094\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. To date, the FDIC has not\nformally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy and\nit is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a Title II\nresolution of Citigroup.\n\nUnder the regulations of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding\ncompany is expected to act as a source of financial strength for\nits subsidiary\nbanks. As a result of this regulatory policy, the Federal\nReserve might require Citigroup to commit resources to its\nsubsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the\ninterests of Citigroup or its shareholders or creditors.\n\nUnder the terms of the Indenture, a Citigroup bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or resolution proceeding will not constitute an event\nof default with\nrespect to any series of debt securities issued by Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings. Moreover, it will not constitute an\nevent of default with respect to any series of Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings debt securities if the guarantee of the debt\nsecurities by Citigroup ceases to be in full force and effect\nfor any reason, including Citigroup\u0092s insolvency or resolution.\nShould the Citigroup guarantee no longer be in effect, Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings will become the sole obligor\nunder its debt securities, and there can be no assurance that it\nwould be able to continue to meet its obligations under the debt\nsecurities.\n\nIn the event that Citigroup Global Markets Holdings also enters\nbankruptcy, at the time of Citigroup\u0092s bankruptcy filing or at a\nlater\ntime, holders of debt securities issued by Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings would be unsecured creditors of Citigroup in\nrespect of the Citigroup guarantee and, accordingly, cannot be\nassured that the Citigroup guarantee would protect them against\nlosses resulting from a Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\ndefault.\n\nInstitutional Clients Group (\u0093ICG\u0094) provides\ncorporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth\nclients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking\nproducts and services, including fixed income\nand equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage,\nderivative services, equity and fixed income\n\n8\n\nresearch, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory\nservices, private banking, cash management, trade finance and\nsecurities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash\ninstruments\nand derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency,\nequity and commodity products.\n\nICG revenue is generated primarily from fees\nand spreads associated with these activities. ICG earns fee\nincome for assisting clients with transactional services and\nclearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services\nand other such activities. Revenue generated from these\nactivities is recorded in Investment banking and Commissions and\nfees. Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and\nadministration, which is primarily recorded in Administration\nand other fiduciary fees. In addition, as a market maker,\nICG facilitates transactions, including holding product\ninventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential\nbetween the price at which it buys and sells the products. These\nprice differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the\ninventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other\nprimarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-\nsale debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not\nheld in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and\nlosses.\nInterest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on\nlong- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is\nrecorded as Net interest revenue.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market\nvariables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity\nprices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities; investor confidence; and other\nmacroeconomic conditions. Assuming all other market conditions\ndo not\nchange, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads\ngenerally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in\nmarket conditions can significantly impact client activity\nlevels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product\ninventory. For example, a decrease in market liquidity may\nincrease bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and\nwiden credit spreads on product inventory positions.\n\nICG\u0092s international presence is supported by trading floors in\napproximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 96\ncountries and\njurisdictions. At December 31, 2020, ICG had $1.7 trillion in\nassets and $924 billion in deposits, while two of its\nbusinesses\u0097securities services and issuer services\u0097managed $24.0\ntrillion and $20.3 trillion in assets under custody as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe principal office of Citigroup is located at 388 Greenwich\nStreet, New York, New York 10013,\nand its telephone number is (212) 559-1000.\n\n9\n\nCITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS HOLDINGS INC.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., operating through its\nsubsidiaries, engages in full-service investment banking and\nsecurities\nbrokerage business. As used in this description, Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings and the Company refer to Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings operates in the ICG segment.\n\nThe principal offices of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings are\nlocated at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, and\nits telephone\nnumber is (212) 559-1000. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings was\nincorporated in New York on February 23, 1977 and is the\nsuccessor to Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation,\nfollowing a statutory merger effective on July 1, 1999, for the\npurpose of changing its state of incorporation. On April 7,\n2003, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings filed a Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation in the State of New York\nchanging its name from Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc. to\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.\n\n10\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS AND HEDGING\n\nGeneral. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings will use the proceeds\nit receives from the sale of the offered\nsecurities for general corporate purposes, which may include:\n                                                                \n      funding the business of its operating units and the       \n      operating units of Citigroup and its subsidiaries;        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      funding investments in, or extensions of credit or        \n      capital contributions to, its and Citigroup\u0092s              \n      subsidiaries;                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      financing possible acquisitions or business expansion;    \n      and                                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      lengthening the average maturity of liabilities, which    \n      means that it could reduce its short-term liabilities or  \n      refund maturing indebtedness.                             \n                                                                \nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings expects to incur additional\nindebtedness in the future\nto fund its businesses. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one\nor more affiliates may enter into a derivative or other\ntransaction in connection with the sale of the offered\nsecurities and may earn additional income from that transaction.\n\nUse of Proceeds Relating to Indexed Notes. Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings or one or more of its affiliates\nmay use all or some of the proceeds received from the sale of\nindexed notes to purchase or maintain positions in the\nunderlying assets. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one or\nmore of its affiliates may also purchase or maintain positions\nin\noptions, futures contracts, forward contracts or swaps, or\noptions on the foregoing, or other derivative or similar\ninstruments relating to the relevant index or underlying assets.\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings may also use the proceeds to\npay\nthe costs and expenses of hedging any currency, interest rate or\nother index-related risk relating to such indexed notes.\n\nCitigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings expects that it or one or more of its\naffiliates will increase or decrease their initial hedging\nposition over time using techniques which help evaluate the size\nof any hedge based upon a variety of factors affecting the\nvalue of the underlying instrument. These factors may include\nthe history of price changes in that underlying instrument and\nthe time remaining to maturity. Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings or one or more of its affiliates may take long or short\npositions in the index, the underlying assets, options, futures\ncontracts, forward contracts, swaps, or options on the\nforegoing, or other derivative or similar instruments related to\nthe index or the underlying assets. These other hedging\nactivities may occur from time to time before the indexed notes\nmature and will depend on market conditions and the value of the\nindex and the underlying assets.\n\nIn addition, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one or more of\nits affiliates may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short\nposition in\nindexed notes from time to time and may, in their sole\ndiscretion, hold, resell, exercise, cancel or retire such\noffered securities. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one or\nmore of its affiliates may also take hedging positions in other\ntypes of\nappropriate financial instruments that may become available in\nthe future.\n\nIf Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one or more of its\naffiliates has a long hedge position in, or options, futures\ncontracts or swaps or options on the foregoing, or other\nderivative or similar instruments related to, the index or\nunderlying assets, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings or one or\nmore of\nits affiliates may liquidate all or a portion of its holdings at\nor about the time of the maturity or earlier redemption or\nrepurchase of, or the payment of any indexed interest on, the\nindexed notes. The aggregate amount and type of such positions\nare likely to vary over time depending on future market\nconditions and other factors. Since the hedging activities\ndescribed in this section involve risks and may be influenced by\na number of factors, it is possible that Citigroup Global\nMarkets\nHoldings or one or more of its affiliates may receive a profit\nfrom the hedging activities, even if the market value of the\nindexed notes declines. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings is\nonly able to determine profits or losses from any such position\nwhen the position is closed out and any offsetting position or\npositions are taken into account.\n\n11\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings has no reason to believe that\nits hedging activities, as well\nas those of its affiliates, will have a material impact on the\nprice of such options, futures contracts, forward contracts,\nswaps, options on the foregoing, or other derivative or similar\ninstruments, or on the value of the index or the underlying\nassets. However, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings cannot\nguarantee you that its hedging activities, as well as those of\nits affiliates, will not affect such prices or values. Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings will use the remainder of the proceeds\nfrom the sale of indexed notes for the general corporate\npurposes described above.\n\n12\n\nEUROPEAN MONETARY UNION\n\nThe foreign currencies in which debt securities may be\ndenominated or by which amounts due on the offered securities\nmay be calculated could\nbe issued by countries that are member states of the European\nUnion that have adopted or adopt the single Euro currency in\naccordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community\n(as that Treaty is amended from time to time) (the\n\u0093Participating Member States\u0094).\n\nThe current Participating Member States are: Austria, Belgium,\nBulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,\nCzechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nHungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,\nthe Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,\nSpain and Sweden. Other member states of the European Union\nmay also become participating member states of the single Euro\ncurrency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThe debt securities offered by this prospectus will be\nguaranteed unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Citigroup\nGlobal\nMarkets Holdings. The debt securities will be issued under a\nsenior debt indenture dated as of March 8, 2016 and supplemented\nfrom time to time. The senior debt indenture, as amended, is\nsometimes referred to in this prospectus as the\n\u0093indenture.\u0094 The senior debt indenture (or form thereof) has\nbeen filed with the SEC and is included in the registration\nstatement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, of which\nthis prospectus forms a part. In the event of (i) any conflict\nbetween a provision of the senior debt indenture and the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939, as amended (the \u0093TIA\u0094) or (ii) the\nomission of a provision required to be\nincluded in the senior debt indenture by the TIA, the TIA will\ncontrol.\n\nThe following briefly summarizes the material provisions of the\nindenture and the debt securities, other than pricing and\nrelated terms disclosed in the accompanying prospectus\nsupplement or pricing supplement, as the case may be. You should\nread the more detailed provisions of the indenture, including\nthe\ndefined terms, for provisions that may be important to you. You\nshould also read the particular terms of an offering of debt\nsecurities, which will be described in more detail in the\napplicable prospectus supplement and/or pricing supplement.\nCopies\nof the indenture may be obtained from Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings, Citigroup or the trustee. So that you may easily\nlocate the more detailed provisions, the numbers in parentheses\nbelow refer to sections in the indenture. Wherever particular\nsections or defined terms of the indenture are referred to, such\nsections or defined terms are incorporated into this prospectus\nby reference, and the statements in this prospectus are\nqualified by that reference. If any debt securities are to be\nissued under an indenture having terms that differ from those\ndescribed below, the terms of such indenture will be as\ndescribed in the applicable supplement for the offering of such\ndebt securities.\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093supplement\u0094 means either a\nprospectus supplement or a pricing supplement, as applicable.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, the trustee under the indenture\nwill be The Bank of\nNew York Mellon. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings has appointed\nCitibank, N.A. to act as registrar and paying agent under the\nindenture.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe indenture provides that unsecured senior debt securities of\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings, the payment on which is fully\nand\nunconditionally guaranteed by Citigroup, may be issued in one or\nmore series, with different terms, in each case as authorized\nfrom time to time by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings.\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings also has the right to\n\u0093reopen\u0094 a previous issue of a series of debt securities by\nissuing additional debt securities of such series.\n\n13\n\nUnited States federal income tax consequences and other special\nconsiderations applicable to any\ndebt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings at a\ndiscount or a premium will be described in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nBecause Citigroup is a holding company, the claims of creditors\nof Citigroup\u0092s subsidiaries will have a priority over\nCitigroup\u0092s\nequity rights and the rights of Citigroup\u0092s creditors, including\nthe holders of debt securities, to participate in the assets of\nCitigroup\u0092s subsidiaries (other than Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings) upon any subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation. Similarly, because Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings is also a holding company, the claims of creditors of\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092 subsidiaries will have a\npriority over Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092 equity\nrights and the rights of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\ncreditors, including the holders of debt securities, to\nparticipate in the assets of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\nsubsidiaries upon any subsidiary\u0092s liquidation.\n\nThe applicable supplement relating to any offering of debt\nsecurities will describe the following terms, where applicable:\n                                         \n      the title of the debt securities;

The terms may include\nprovisions\npursuant to which the number of shares of common stock or other\nsecurities to be received by the holders of such debt securities\nmay be adjusted.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, the debt securities are not subject\nto any sinking\nfund.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, debt securities denominated in U.S.\ndollars\nwill be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and whole\nmultiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (Section 2.01). The\nsupplement relating to debt securities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency will specify the denomination of such debt securities.\n\nThe currency for payment for book-entry debt securities\ndenominated in a foreign currency will be specified in the\napplicable supplement.\nHowever, when interests in such debt securities are held through\nThe Depository Trust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094), all payments in respect of\nsuch debt securities will be made in U.S. dollars. See \u0093\u0097 Book-\nEntry Procedures and\nSettlement\u0094 and \u0093Currency Conversions and Foreign Exchange Risks\nAffecting Debt Securities Denominated in a Foreign Currency \u0097\nCurrency Conversions\u0094 below.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings may, without notice to or\nconsent of the holders or beneficial owners of a series of debt\nsecurities, issue\nadditional debt securities having the same ranking, interest\nrate, maturity and other terms as the debt securities initially\nissued. Any such debt securities could be considered part of the\nsame series of debt securities under the indenture as the\ndebt securities initially issued.\n\nThe debt securities will be issued only in registered form. As\ncurrently anticipated, debt securities\nof a series will trade in book-entry form, and global notes will\nbe issued in physical (paper) form, as described below under \u0093\u0097\nBook-Entry Procedures and Settlement.\u0094\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, the debt securities may be\npresented for exchange, and\ndebt securities other than a global security may be presented\nfor registration of transfer, at the principal trust office of\nthe registrar maintained for such purpose in New York City.\nHolders will not have to pay any service charge for any\nregistration of transfer or exchange of debt securities, but\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings may require payment of a sum\nsufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable\nin connection with such registration of transfer (Section 3.06).\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities denominated in a foreign currency, a\nfiscal agency agreement will be entered into in relation to the\ndebt securities between\n\n15\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings and Citibank, N.A., London\nBranch, as registrar, fiscal agent and principal paying agent.\nThe terms \u0093registrar,\u0094 \u0093fiscal agent,\u0094 and\n\u0093principal paying agent\u0094 shall include any successors appointed\nfrom time to time in accordance with the provisions of the\nfiscal agency agreement, and any reference to an \u0093agent\u0094 or\n\u0093agents\u0094 shall mean any or all (as\napplicable) of such persons. The holders of the debt securities\nare bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, the provisions\nof the fiscal agency agreement. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities,\ncopies of the fiscal agency agreement are available for\ninspection during usual business hours at the principal office\nof Citibank, N.A., London Branch, located at Citigroup Centre,\nCanada Square, Canary Wharf, London, England.\n\nPayments of Principal and Interest\n\nPayments of principal and interest on debt securities issued in\nbook-entry form will be made as described below under\n\u0093\u0097 Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement.\u0094 Payments of principal\nand interest on debt securities issued in definitive form, if\nany, will be made as described below under \u0093\u0097 Definitive Notes\nand Paying Agents.\u0094\n\nInterest on the debt securities will be paid on the dates\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities (each, an\n\u0093interest payment date\u0094). If an interest payment date for a\nfixed rate note or the maturity date or redemption date of the\ndebt securities falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the\npayment due on such interest payment date or on the\nmaturity date or redemption date will be postponed to the next\nsucceeding Business Day, and no further interest will accrue in\nrespect of such postponement. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities, if\nan interest payment date for a floating rate note falls on a day\nthat is not a Business Day, such interest payment date will be\nthe next following Business Day unless that day falls in the\nnext calendar month, in which case the interest payment date\nwill be the first preceding Business Day.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, all\npayments of interest on the debt securities will be made to the\npersons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of\nbusiness on the Business Day preceding an interest payment date.\n\nInterest on the debt securities will be paid on the dates\nspecified in connection with each particular offering of debt\nsecurities. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\ndebt securities, in this section, \u0093Business Day\u0094 means any day\nwhich is a day on which commercial banks settle payments and are\nopen for general business (a) in New York,\nin the case of U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities; (b) in\nNew York, London and Tokyo, in the case of Yen-denominated debt\nsecurities; and (c) in New York and London and which is also a\nTARGET\nbusiness day (\u0093TARGET\u0094), in the case of Euro-denominated debt\nsecurities. A \u0093TARGET business day\u0094 is a day on which TARGET 2\nis open for the settlement of payment in Euro, and \u0093TARGET 2\u0094 is\nthe Trans- European Automated\nReal-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer payment system which\nutilizes a single shared platform and which was launched on\nNovember 19, 2007. Unless otherwise specified in connection with\na particular offering of debt securities, in the case\nof Canadian dollar-denominated debt securities, \u0093Business Day\u0094\nshall mean any Toronto business day which is a day on which\ncommercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments\nand are open for general business (including dealings\nin foreign currency deposits and foreign exchange) in Toronto.\n\nIf a date for payment of interest or principal on the debt\nsecurities\nfalls on a day that is not a business day in the place of\npayment, such payment will be made on the next succeeding\nbusiness day in such place of payment as if made on the date the\npayment was due. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable\nfor\nthe period from and after the due date for payment of such\nprincipal or interest.\n\n16\n\nInterest Rate Determination\n\nFixed Rate Notes\n\nUnless otherwise\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, each fixed rate note will bear interest from its\noriginal issue date, or from the last interest payment date to\nwhich interest has been\n\npaid or duly provided for, at the rate per annum stated in the\napplicable supplement until its principal amount is paid or made\navailable for payment.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, interest on each fixed rate note\nwill be payable\nsemi-annually in arrears on the dates set forth in the\napplicable supplement, with each such day being an interest\npayment date, and at maturity. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities,\ninterest on\nU.S.-dollar-denominated fixed rate notes will be calculated on\nthe basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months\nor, in the case of an incomplete month, the\nnumber of days elapsed. The day-count for fixed rate notes\ndenominated in any other currency will be set forth in the\napplicable supplement. All U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro\namounts resulting from\nthis calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-\nhalf cent being rounded upward. All Yen amounts resulting from\nthis calculation will be rounded to the nearest Yen, with five-\ntenths or more of\n\u00a51 to be rounded upwards to the nearest \u00a51 per debt security.\nThe rounding convention for any other currency will be set forth\nin the applicable supplement.\n\nFloating Rate Notes\n\nEach floating rate\nnote will bear interest at the interest rate specified in the\nsupplement relating to a particular series of debt securities.\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, interest on each floating rate note\nwill be payable quarterly in arrears on the dates set forth in\nthe applicable supplement, with each such day being an interest\npayment date, and at maturity. Unless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of debt securities,\ninterest on floating rate notes will be calculated on the basis\nof the actual number of days in an interest period and a 360-day\nyear. An interest period is the period commencing on an interest\npayment date\nand ending on the day preceding the next following interest\npayment date.\n\nThe first interest period will commence on the day the floating\nrate notes are issued and will end on the day preceding the next\nfollowing interest payment date.\n\nThe interest rate for each offering of\nfloating rate notes for a particular interest period will be a\nper annum rate equal to the base rate specified in the\napplicable supplement, as determined on the relevant interest\ndetermination date (as defined in the applicable supplement),\nplus or\nminus any spread or multiplied by any spread multiplier. A basis\npoint, or bp, equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. The\nspread is the number of basis points specified in the applicable\nsupplement and\nthe spread multiplier is the percentage specified in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nEach floating rate note will bear interest for each\ninterest period at a rate determined by Citibank, N.A., acting\nas calculation agent. Promptly upon determination, the\ncalculation agent will inform the trustee and Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings of the interest rate for the next interest\nperiod.\nAbsent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by\nthe calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the\nholders of such floating rate notes, the trustee and Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings. Upon request from any noteholder,\nthe calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect\non the notes for the current interest period and, if it has been\ndetermined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next\ninterest period.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, all percentages resulting from any\ncalculation of the\nrate of interest on a floating rate note will be rounded, if\nnecessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1% (.0000001), with five\none-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. All\ncurrency amounts used in,\nor resulting from, the calculation on floating rate notes will\nbe rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit. For purposes\nof rounding, .005 of a unit shall be rounded upward.\n\n17\n\nBook-Entry Procedures and Settlement\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, we will issue debt securities under\na book-entry system\nin the form of one or more global securities. We will register\nthe global securities in the name of a depositary or its nominee\nand deposit the global securities with that depositary. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, The Depository Trust Company, New\nYork, New York, or DTC, will be the depositary if we use a\ndepositary.\n\nFollowing the issuance of a global security in registered form,\nthe depositary will credit the accounts of its participants with\nthe debt\nsecurities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly\nor indirectly through financial institutions that are\nparticipants in the depositary can hold beneficial interests in\nthe global securities. Because the laws of some jurisdictions\nrequire certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of\nsuch securities in definitive form, you may encounter\ndifficulties in your ability to own, transfer or pledge\nbeneficial interests in a global security.\n\nSo long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner\nof a global security, we and the trustee will treat the\ndepositary as the\nsole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the\nindenture. Therefore, except as set forth below, you will not be\nentitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to\nreceive physical delivery of certificates representing\nthe debt securities. Accordingly, you will have to rely on the\nprocedures of the depositary and the participant in the\ndepositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in\norder to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We\nunderstand that under existing practices, the depositary would\nact upon the instructions of a participant or authorize that\nparticipant to take any action that a holder is entitled to\ntake.\n\nYou may elect to hold interests in the global securities either\nin the United States through DTC or outside the United States\nthrough\nClearstream Banking S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094) or Euroclear Bank,\nSA/NV, or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System,\n(\u0093Euroclear\u0094) if you are a participant of such system, or\nindirectly through organizations that are\nparticipants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream\nand Euroclear will be recorded on DTC\u0092s books as being held by\nthe U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear, which\nU.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on\nbehalf of their participants\u0092 customers\u0092 securities accounts.\n\nAs long as the debt securities are represented by the global\nsecurities, we will pay principal of and interest and premium,\nif any, on those securities to or as directed by DTC as the\nregistered holder of the global securities. Payments to DTC will\nbe in immediately available funds by wire transfer. DTC,\nClearstream or Euroclear, as applicable, will credit the\nrelevant accounts of their participants on the applicable date.\nNeither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any\npayments to participants or customers of participants or for\nmaintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants\nand their customers, and you will have to rely on the procedures\nof the depositary and its participants.\n\nIf an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency\nother than the U.S. dollar, we will make payments of principal\nand any interest in\nthe foreign currency in which the debt securities are\ndenominated or, for notes held through DTC, in U.S. dollars. See\n\u0093Currency Conversions and Foreign Exchange Risks Affecting Debt\nSecurities Denominated in a Foreign Currency\n\u0097 Currency Conversions\u0094 below.\n\nSettlement\n\nYou will be required to make your initial payment for the debt\nsecurities in immediately available funds. Secondary market\ntrading between DTC\nparticipants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with\nDTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds\nusing DTC\u0092s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Secondary market\ntrading between\nClearstream customers and/or Euroclear participants will occur\nin the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and\noperating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear and will be\nsettled using the procedures applicable to conventional\neurobonds in immediately available funds.\n\n18\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding directly or\nindirectly through DTC, on the one\nhand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream customers\nor Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC\nin accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European\ninternational clearing system by U.S. depositary;\nhowever, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of\ninstructions to the relevant European international clearing\nsystem by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its\nrules and procedures and within its established deadlines\n(based on European time). The relevant European international\nclearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement\nrequirements, deliver instructions to the U.S. depositary to\ntake action to effect final settlement on its behalf by\ndelivering or receiving debt securities in DTC, and making or\nreceiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-\nday funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream customers\nand Euroclear\nparticipants may not deliver instructions directly to their\nrespective U.S. depositaries.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of\ndebt securities received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result\nof a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during\nsubsequent securities settlement processing and dated the\nbusiness day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or\nany transactions in such debt securities settled during such\nprocessing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream\ncustomers or Euroclear participants on such business day. Cash\nreceived in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of\ndebt\nsecurities by or through a Clearstream customer or a Euroclear\nparticipant to a DTC participant will be received with value on\nthe DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant\nClearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the\nbusiness day following settlement in DTC.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the\nforegoing procedures in order to\nfacilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of\nDTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to\nperform or continue to perform such procedures and such\nprocedures may be discontinued at any time.\n\nDefinitive Notes and Paying Agents\n\nA\nbeneficial owner of book-entry securities represented by a\nglobal security may exchange the securities for definitive\n(paper) securities only if:\n                                                                \n       the depositary is unwilling or unable to continue as     \n       depositary for such global security and Citigroup        \n  (a)  Global                                                   \n       Markets Holdings is unable to find a qualified           \n       replacement for the depositary within 90 days;           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       the depositary ceases to be a clearing agency            \n       registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or  \n       Clearstream, Euroclear, CREST or any other securities    \n       depositary, book-entry system or clearing agency         \n  (b)  located outside the United States which is so            \n       authorized to act under applicable law and, in each      \n       case, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings notifies         \n       the trustee that it is unable to find a qualified        \n       successor depositary; or                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       Citigroup Global Markets Holdings in its sole            \n       discretion decides to allow some or all book-entry       \n  (c)  securities to                                            \n       be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered  \n       form.                                                    \n                                                                \nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of debt securities, any global security that\nis exchangeable will be exchangeable in whole for definitive\nsecurities in registered form, with the same terms and of an\nequal aggregate principal amount, in denominations of $1,000\nand whole multiples of $1,000.

and     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of Citigroup   \n      Global Markets Holdings, whether voluntary or not         \n      (Section 6.01).                                           \n                                                                \nEvents of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution proceedings\nrelating to Citigroup will not\nconstitute an event of default with respect to any series of\ndebt securities. Similarly, any breach of a covenant in the\nindenture by Citigroup (other than payment default) will not\nconstitute an event of default with respect to any series of\ndebt\nsecurities. Furthermore, it will not constitute an event of\ndefault with respect to any series of debt securities if the\nguarantee of the debt security by Citigroup ceases to be in full\nforce and effect for any reason. Therefore, events of\nbankruptcy or insolvency or resolution proceedings relating to\nCitigroup (in the absence of any such event occurring with\nrespect to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings) will not permit\nany of the debt securities to be declared due and payable. In\naddition, a breach of a covenant by Citigroup (including, for\nexample, a breach of Citigroup\u0092s covenants with respect to\nmergers, the sale of all or substantially all its assets or\nlimitations on liens, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097 Covenants\u0094), other than payment default, will not permit any\nof the debt securities to be declared due and payable. The value\nyou receive on any series of debt securities may be\nsignificantly less than what you would have\notherwise received had the debt securities been declared due and\npayable immediately upon certain events of bankruptcy or\ninsolvency or resolution proceedings relating to Citigroup or\nthe breach of a covenant by Citigroup or upon Citigroup\u0092s\nguarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect.\n\nIf an event of default regarding debt securities of any series\nissued under the\nindenture should occur and be continuing, either the trustee or\nthe holders of 25% in the principal amount of outstanding debt\nsecurities of such series may declare each debt security of that\nseries due and payable (Section 6.02). Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings and Citigroup are required to file\nannually with the trustee a statement of an officer as to the\nfulfillment by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings and Citigroup\nof its obligations under the indenture during the preceding year\n(Section 5.06).\n\nNo event of default regarding one series of debt securities\nissued under the indenture is necessarily an event of\ndefault regarding any other series of debt securities (Section\n6.02). For purposes of this section, \u0093series\u0094 refers to debt\nsecurities having identical terms, except as to issue date,\nprincipal amount and, if applicable, the date\nfrom which interest begins to accrue.\n\nHolders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding\ndebt securities of any series will be\nentitled to control certain actions of the trustee under the\nindenture and to waive past defaults regarding such series\n(Sections 6.02 and 6.06). The trustee generally will not be\nunder any obligation to act at the request, order or direction\nof any of the holders of debt securities, unless one or more of\nsuch holders shall have offered to the trustee reasonable\nsecurity or indemnity satisfactory to it (Section 10.01).\n\nIf an event of default occurs regarding a series of debt\nsecurities, the trustee may use any sums that it collects under\nthe indenture for its\nown reasonable compensation and expenses incurred prior to\npaying the holders of debt securities of such series (Section\n6.05).\n\nBefore any holder of any series of debt securities may institute\naction for any remedy, except payment on such holder\u0092s debt\nsecurity\nwhen due, the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount\nof the debt securities of that series outstanding must request\nthe trustee to take action. Holders must also offer security and\nindemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against\nliabilities incurred by the trustee for taking such action\n(Section6.07).\n\n23\n\nDefeasance\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of debt securities, after Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings has deposited\nwith the paying agent cash and/or U.S. government securities or,\nin the case of debt securities denominated in a currency other\nthan U.S. dollars, after Citigroup Global Markets Holdings has\ndeposited with the paying agent funds in the currency\nspecified in the applicable supplement and/or other government\nsecurities specified in the applicable supplement in trust for\nthe benefit of the beneficial owners sufficient to pay the\nprincipal of, premium, if any, and interest on the debt\nsecurities of such series when due, then Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings, at its option:\n                                                                \n      will be deemed to have paid and satisfied its             \n      obligations on all outstanding debt securities of such    \n      series,                                                   \n      which is known as \u0093defeasance and discharge\u0094 (Section       \n      12.02); or                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      will cease to be under any obligation under specific      \n      covenants, relating to the debt securities of such        \n      series,                                                   \n      which is known as \u0093covenant defeasance\u0094 (Section 12.03).    \n                                                                \nIn the case of both defeasance and discharge\nand covenant defeasance, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings must\nalso deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect\nthat the beneficial owners of the debt securities of such series\nwill have no United States federal income tax\nconsequences as a result of such deposit (Section12.04).\n\nWhen there is a defeasance and discharge,\n(1) the indenture will no longer govern the debt securities of\nsuch series, (2) Citigroup Global Markets Holdings and Citigroup\nwill no longer be liable for payment and (3) the beneficial\nowners of such debt securities will be\nentitled only to the deposited funds. When there is a covenant\ndefeasance, however, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings and\nCitigroup will continue to be obligated to make payments when\ndue if the deposited funds are not sufficient.\n\nThe obligations and rights under the indenture regarding\ncompensation, reimbursement and indemnification of the trustee,\noptional redemption,\nmandatory or optional sinking fund payments, if any,\nregistration of transfer and exchange of the debt securities of\nsuch series, replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen\ndebt securities and certain other administrative provisions will\ncontinue even if Citigroup Global Markets Holdings exercises its\ndefeasance and discharge or covenant defeasance options\n(Sections 12.02 and 12.03).\n\nUnder current United States federal income tax law, defeasance\nand discharge should be treated as a taxable exchange of the\ndebt securities\nfor an interest in the trust. As a consequence, each beneficial\nowner of the debt securities would recognize gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the value of the beneficial owner\u0092s\ninterest in the trust and beneficial owner\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis for the debt securities deemed exchanged,\nexcept to the extent attributable to accrued but unpaid\ninterest, which will be taxable as ordinary income. Each\nbeneficial owner would then be required to include in income his\nshare of\nany income, gain and loss recognized by the trust. Even though\nUnited States federal income tax on the deemed exchange would be\nimposed on a beneficial owner, the beneficial owner would not\nreceive any cash until the maturity or an earlier\nredemption of the debt securities, except for any current\ninterest payments. Prospective investors are urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors as to the specific consequences of a\ndefeasance and discharge, including the applicability and effect\nof tax\nlaws other than the United States federal income tax law.\n\nUnder current United States federal income tax law, a covenant\ndefeasance would\nnot be treated as a taxable exchange of debt securities.\n\nCitigroup Guarantees\n\nThe payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\nCitigroup. If\nfor any reason Citigroup Global Markets Holdings does not make\nany required payment in respect of its debt securities when due,\nCitigroup will cause the payment to be made at\n\n24\n\nthe same address at which Citigroup Global Markets Holdings is\nobligated to make such payment. The holder of a guaranteed debt\nsecurity will be entitled to payment under the relevant\nguarantee of\nCitigroup without taking any action whatsoever against Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings. Citigroup\u0092s obligations under its\nguarantee are unconditional, irrespective of any (i) extension,\namendment, modification or renewal of any required\npayment; (ii) any waiver of any event of default, extension of\ntime or failure to enforce any required payment; or (iii) any\nextension, moratorium or other relief granted to Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings pursuant to any applicable law\nor statute. The indenture permits Citigroup, at its option and\nwithout the consent of the holders of the debt securities of any\nseries, to assume all of the obligations of Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings under any debt securities. Upon any such\nassumption, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings will be released\nfrom its obligations under such debt securities.\n\nConcerning the Trustee\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings, Citigroup and certain of\ntheir affiliates have had and may continue to have banking\nrelationships with the\ntrustee in the ordinary course of business.\n\nCURRENCY CONVERSIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS AFFECTING\n\nDEBT SECURITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY\n\nCurrency Conversions\n\nUnless otherwise\nspecified in connection with a particular offering of debt\nsecurities, debt securities denominated in a foreign currency\nwhich are offered and sold in the United States (\u0093DTC debt\nsecurities\u0094) will be represented by beneficial interests in\nfully registered permanent global debt securities (\u0093DTC global\ndebt securities\u0094) which will be deposited with Citibank, N.A.,\nLondon Branch, as custodian for, and registered in the name of\nCede & Co., as nominee for, DTC. While\ninterests in the DTC debt securities are held through the DTC\nglobal debt securities, all payments in respect of such debt\nsecurities will be made in U.S. dollars.\n\nAs determined by the exchange agent under the terms of the\nfiscal agency agreement, in accordance with reasonable market\npractice, the amount\nof U.S. dollars payable in respect of any particular payment\nunder the DTC debt securities will be equal to the amount of the\nrelevant foreign currency U.S.$ rate of exchange prevailing as\nof 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day which is two Business\nDays prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred\nby the exchange agent for such conversion (to be shared pro rata\namong the holders of DTC debt securities accepting U.S. dollar\npayments in the proportion of their respective\nholdings), all in accordance with the fiscal agency agreement.\nIf an exchange rate bid quotation is not available, the exchange\nagent shall obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign\nexchange bank in London selected by the exchange agent for such\npurpose after consultation with Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings. If no bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange\nbank is available, payment will be in the relevant foreign\ncurrency to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the\nexchange\nagent. For purposes of this paragraph, a \u0093Business Day\u0094 is a day\non which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle\npayments in each of New York City and London.\n\nAlthough DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures, it is under\nno obligation to perform or continue to perform these\nprocedures, and these\nprocedures may be modified or discontinued.\n\nHolders of the debt securities will be subject to foreign\nexchange risks as to payments of\nprincipal and interest that may have important economic and tax\nconsequences to them. For further information as to such\nconsequences, see \u0093\u0097 Foreign Exchange Risks\u0094 below.\n\nJudgments in a Foreign Currency\n\nThe debt\nsecurities will be governed by, and construed in accordance\nwith, the laws of New York State. Courts in the United States\ncustomarily have not rendered judgments for money damages\ndenominated in any\n\n25\n\ncurrency other than the U.S. dollar. A 1987 amendment to the\nJudiciary Law of New York State provides, however, that an\naction based upon an obligation denominated in a currency other\nthan U.S.\ndollars will be rendered in the foreign currency of the\nunderlying obligation. Any judgment awarded in such an action\nwill be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange\nprevailing on the date of the entry of the judgment or decree.\n\nForeign Exchange Risks\n\nAn investment in\ndebt securities which are denominated in, and all payments in\nrespect of which are to be made in, a currency other than the\ncurrency of the country in which the purchaser is a resident or\nthe currency in which the purchaser conducts its business or\nactivities (the \u0093home currency\u0094) entails significant risks that\nare not associated with a similar investment in a security\ndenominated in the home currency. Such risks include, without\nlimitation, the possibility of significant changes in\nthe rates of exchange between the home currency and the relevant\nforeign currency and the possibility of the imposition or\nmodification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the\nrelevant foreign currency. Such risks generally depend on\neconomic and political events over which Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings has no control. In recent years, rates of\nexchange for foreign currencies have been volatile and such\nvolatility may be expected to continue in the future.\nFluctuations in\nany particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past are\nnot necessarily indicative, however, of fluctuations in such\nrate that may occur during the term of the debt securities.\nDepreciation of the relevant foreign currency against the\nrelevant home currency could result in a decrease in the\neffective yield of such relevant foreign denominated debt\nsecurity below its coupon rate and, in certain circumstances,\ncould result in a loss to the investor on a home currency basis.\n\nThis description of foreign currency risks does not describe all\nthe risks of an investment in debt securities denominated in a\ncurrency other\nthan the home currency. Prospective investors should consult\nwith their financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved\nin an investment in a particular offering of debt securities.\n\n26\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings may offer the offered\nsecurities in one or more of the following ways from time to\ntime:\n                                              \n      to or through underwriters or dealers;  \n                                              \n                           \n      by itself directly;  \n                           \n                          \n      through agents; or  \n                          \n                                                              \n      through a combination of any of these methods of sale.  \n                                                              \nAny such underwriters, dealers or agents may include any broker-\ndealer affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings.\n\nThe supplement relating to an offering of offered securities\nwill set forth the terms of such offering, including:\n                                                                \n      the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or         \n      agents;                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the purchase price of the offered securities and the      \n      proceeds to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings from such   \n      sale;                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any underwriting discounts and commissions or agency      \n      fees and other items constituting underwriters\u0092 or         \n      agents\u0092 compensation;                                      \n                                                                \n                                          \n      the initial public offering price;  \n                                          \n                                                                \n      any discounts or concessions to be allowed or reallowed   \n      or paid to dealers; and                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any securities exchanges on which such offered            \n      securities may be listed.                                 \n                                                                \nAny initial public offering prices, discounts or concessions\nallowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be changed from time\nto time.\n\nIf underwriters are used in an offering of offered securities,\nsuch offered securities will be acquired by the underwriters for\ntheir own\naccount and may be resold from time to time in one or more\ntransactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed\npublic offering price or at varying prices determined at the\ntime of sale. The securities may be offered either to the public\nthrough underwriting syndicates represented by one or more\nmanaging underwriters or by one or more underwriters without a\nsyndicate. Unless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of securities, the underwriters will not be\nobligated to purchase offered securities unless specified\nconditions are satisfied, and if the underwriters do purchase\nany offered securities, they will purchase all offered\nsecurities.\n\nIn connection with underwritten offerings of the offered\nsecurities and in accordance with applicable law and industry\npractice, underwriters\nmay over-allot or effect transactions that stabilize, maintain\nor otherwise affect the market price of the offered securities\nat levels above those that might otherwise prevail in the open\nmarket, including by entering stabilizing bids, effecting\nsyndicate covering transactions or imposing penalty bids, each\nof which is described below.\n                                                                \n      A stabilizing bid means the placing of any bid, or the    \n      effecting of any purchase, for the purpose of pegging,    \n      fixing or maintaining the price of a security.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      A syndicate covering transaction means the placing of     \n      any bid on behalf of the underwriting syndicate or the    \n      effecting of any purchase to reduce a short position      \n      created in connection with the offering.                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      A penalty bid means an arrangement that permits the       \n      managing underwriter to reclaim a selling concession      \n      from a                                                    \n      syndicate member in connection with the offering when     \n      offered securities originally sold by the syndicate       \n      member are purchased in syndicate covering transactions.  \n                                                                \n27\n\nThese transactions may be effected on the NYSE, in the over-the-\ncounter market, or otherwise.

An investment in\nforeign currency notes, which are notes denominated in a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars, entails significant\nrisks that are not associated with a similar investment in a\nsecurity denominated in U.S. dollars. Similarly, an investment\nin an indexed note, on which all or a part of any payment due is\nbased on one or more currencies other than U.S. dollars, has\nsignificant risks that are not associated with a similar\ninvestment in non-indexednotes. Such risks include, but are not\nlimited to:\n                                                                \n      the possibility of significant market changes in          \n      exchange rates between U.S. dollars and the relevant      \n      currencies;                                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the possibility of significant changes in exchange rates  \n      between U.S. dollars and the relevant currencies          \n      resulting from official redenomination or revaluation of  \n      such specified currency; and                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      the possibility of the imposition or modification of      \n      foreign exchange controls by either the United States or  \n      foreign governments.                                      \n                                                                \nSuch risks generally depend on factors over which Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings has no control and which cannot be\nreadily foreseen, such as:\n                        \n      economic events;  \n                        \n                             \n      political events; and  \n                             \n                                                               \n      the supply of, and demand for, the relevant currencies.  \n                                                               \nIn recent years, exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and some\nforeign currencies in which Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\nnotes may be denominated, and between these foreign currencies\nand other foreign currencies, have been volatile. This\nvolatility may be expected in the future. Fluctuations that have\noccurred in any particular exchange rate in the past are not\nnecessarily indicative, however, of fluctuations that may occur\nin the exchange rate during the term of any foreign currency\nnote. Depreciation of the specified currency of a foreign\ncurrency note against the U.S. dollar may result in a decrease\nin the effective yield of such foreign currency note below its\ninterest rate and could result in a substantial loss to the\ninvestor on a U.S. dollar basis. Governments have imposed from\ntime to time, and may in the future impose, exchange controls\nthat could affect exchange rates as well as the availability of\na specified currency other than U.S. dollars at the time of\npayment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on, a\nforeign currency note. There can be no assurance that exchange\ncontrols will not restrict or prohibit payments of principal,\npremium (if any) or interest or other amounts payable (if any)\ndenominated in any such specified currency. Similarly, in the\ncase of indexed notes and depending on the specific terms of the\nnotes, fluctuations of the relevant underlying currencies could\nresult in no return or in a substantial loss to the investor.\nEven if there are no actual exchange controls, it is possible\nthat such specified currency would not be available to Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings when payments on a note are due because\nof circumstances beyond the control of Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings. In this event, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings will\nmake required payments in U.S. dollars on the basis described in\nthis prospectus supplement. You should consult your own\nfinancial and legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in\nnotes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. See \u0093\u0097\nThe Unavailability of Currencies Could Result in a Substantial\nLoss to You\u0094 and \u0093Description of the Notes \u0097 Supplemental\nProvisions Relating to Non-U.S. DollarNotes \u0097 Payment of\nPrincipal and Interest\u0094 below. S-1\n\nThe information set forth in this prospectus supplement is\ndirected to prospective purchasers of notes who are United\nStates residents, except where otherwise expressly noted. We\ncannot advise prospective purchasers who are residents of\ncountries other than the United States regarding any matters\nthat may affect the purchase or holding of, or receipt of\npayments of principal, premium or interest on, notes. Such\npersons should consult their advisors with regard to these\nmatters. Any applicable supplement relating to notes having a\nspecified currency other than U.S. dollars will contain a\ndescription of any material exchange controls affecting such\ncurrency and any other required information concerning such\ncurrency.

The amounts\nso payable on any date in such currency shall be converted into\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market\nexchange rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated in the\napplicable supplement. Any payment on such note made under such\ncircumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default or\nan event of default under the indenture under which such note\nwas issued. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement, if the specified currency of a note is officially\nredenominated, such as by an official redenomination of any such\nspecified currency that is a composite currency, then the\npayment obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings on such\nnote will be the amount of redenominated currency that\nrepresents the amount of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\nobligations immediately before the redenomination. The notes\nwill not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under\nsuch notes as a result of:\n                                                                \n      any change in the value of the specified currency of      \n      such notes relative to any other currency due solely to   \n      fluctuations in exchange rates; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any redenomination of any component currency of any       \n      composite currency, unless such composite currency is     \n      itself                                                    \n      officially redenominated.                                 \n                                                                \nFor a description of the European Monetary Union, see \u0093European\nMonetary Union\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus and any\ndisclosure on the European Monetary Union in an applicable\nsupplement. Currently, there are limited facilities in the\nUnited States for conversion of U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies, and vice versa. In addition, banks do not generally\noffer non-U.S.dollar-denominated checking or savings account\nfacilities in the United States. Accordingly, payments on notes\nmade in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be made from an\naccount at a bank located outside the United States, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. Judgments in a\nForeign Currency Could Result in a Substantial Loss to You. The\nnotes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the\nlaws of New York State. Courts in the United States customarily\nhave not rendered judgments for money damages denominated in any\ncurrency other than the U.S. dollar. A 1987 amendment to the\nJudiciary Law of New York State provides, however, that an\naction based upon an obligation denominated in a currency other\nthan U.S. dollars will be rendered in the foreign currency of\nthe underlying obligation. Any judgment awarded in such an\naction will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of\nexchange prevailing on the date of the entry of the judgment or\ndecree. S-2\n\nOther Risk Factors\n\nEvents of Bankruptcy or Insolvency or Resolution Proceedings\nRelating to Citigroup Inc. and Covenant Breach by Citigroup Inc.\nWill Not Constitute an Event of Default With Respect to the\nNotes.\n\nEvents of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution proceedings\nrelating to Citigroup Inc. will not\nconstitute an event of default with respect to the notes.\nSimilarly, any breach of a covenant in the indenture by\nCitigroup Inc. (other than payment default) will not constitute\nan event of default with respect to the notes. Furthermore, it\nwill not\nconstitute an event of default with respect to the notes if the\nguarantee of the notes by Citigroup Inc. ceases to be in full\nforce and effect for any reason. Therefore, events of bankruptcy\nor insolvency or resolution proceedings relating to\nCitigroup Inc. (in the absence of any such event occurring with\nrespect to Citigroup Global Markets Holdings) will not permit\nthe notes to be declared due and payable. In addition, a breach\nof a covenant by Citigroup Inc. (including, for example, a\nbreach of Citigroup Inc.\u0092s covenants with respect to mergers,\nthe sale of all or substantially all its assets or limitations\non liens), other than payment default, will not permit the notes\nto be declared due and payable. The value you receive\non the notes may be significantly less than what you would have\notherwise received had the notes been declared due and payable\nimmediately upon certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency or\nresolution proceedings relating to Citigroup Inc. or the\nbreach of a covenant by Citigroup Inc. or upon Citigroup Inc.\u0092s\nguarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Tax Consequences of an Assumption of the Notes\nare Unclear.\n\nThe notes may be assumed by Citigroup, as provided in the\naccompanying\nprospectus. The law regarding whether or not such an assumption\nwould be considered a taxable modification of the notes is not\nentirely clear and, if the Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094)\nwere to treat the assumption as a taxable\nmodification, a U.S. holder would generally be required to\nrecognize gain (if any) on the notes and the timing and\ncharacter of income recognized with respect to the notes after\nthe assumption could be affected significantly. You should read\ncarefully the discussion under \u0093United States Federal Tax\nConsiderations\u0094 in this prospectus supplement. You should also\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal tax\nconsequences of an assumption of the notes.\n\nAdditional risks specific to particular notes will be detailed\nin an applicable pricing supplement, product supplement and/or\nother supplement.\n\nS-3\n\nIMPORTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION\n\nPurchasers are required to pay for each note in the currency\nspecified by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings for such note. If\nrequested by a\nprospective purchaser of a note having a specified currency\nother than U.S. dollars, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\nexchange rate agent may at its discretion arrange for the\nexchange of U.S. dollars into such specified currency to enable\nthe purchaser to pay for such note. Each such exchange will be\nmade by the exchange rate agent. The terms, conditions,\nlimitations and charges that the exchange rate agent may from\ntime to time establish in accordance with its regular foreign\nexchange practice shall control the exchange. The purchaser must\npay all costs of exchange.\n\nReferences in this prospectus supplement to\n\u0093U.S. dollars,\u0094 \u0093U.S.$,\u0094 \u0093dollar\u0094 or \u0093$\u0094 are to the lawful\ncurrency of the United States.\n\nS-4\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this prospectus supplement, the\naccompanying prospectus and in other information incorporated by\nreference in this\nprospectus are \u0093forward-looking statements\u0094 within the meaning\nof the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.

Indexed principal notes will have a stated principal\namount set forth in the applicable supplement. With respect to\nindexed principal notes, references to the payment of\n\u0093principal\u0094 in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying\nprospectus (other than the \u0093stated principal amount\u0094) in the\ncontext of the amount payable at stated maturity or earlier\nredemption or repayment are to the amount payable on such note\nat stated maturity or earlier redemption or repayment, as\nspecified in the applicable supplement, other than any interest\npayable at such time. Such amount may be greater than, equal to\nor less than the stated principal amount of such note at\nissuance. A description of the index used in any determination\nof the payment at maturity or an interest payment, and the\nmethod or formula by which such payments will be determined\nbased on such index, will be set forth in the applicable\nsupplement. S-7\n\nIf a fixed rate note, floating rate note or indexed rate note is\nalso an indexed principal\nnote, the amount of any interest payment will be determined\nbased on the stated principal amount of such indexed note unless\n\nspecified otherwise in\nconnection with a particular offering of notes. If an indexed\nrate note is also an indexed principal note, the amount payable\nat stated maturity or any earlier redemption or repayment of the\nindexed note may be different from the stated principal\namount.\n\nUnless otherwise set forth in the applicable supplement, the\nregular record date for any interest payment date for an indexed\nnote will be the business day immediately preceding the relevant\ninterest payment date.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of notes, for the purpose of determining\nwhether holders of the requisite principal amount of notes\noutstanding under the indenture have made a demand or given a\nnotice or waiver or taken any other action, the outstanding\nprincipal amount of indexed notes will be deemed to be the\nstated principal amount of such notes.\n\nThe interest rate on an indexed rate\nnote will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted\nby applicable law. The notes will be governed by the law of the\nState of New York. As of the date of this prospectus supplement,\nthe maximum rate of interest under provisions of the New\nYork penal law, with a few exceptions, is 25% per annum on a\nsimple interest basis. Such maximum rate of interest only\napplies to obligations that have an aggregate principal amount\nthat is less than $2,500,000.\n\nAn investment in indexed notes has significant risks, including\nwide fluctuations in value prior to maturity and in the amounts\nof payments\ndue, that are not associated with a similar investment in a\nconventional debt security. Such risks depend on a number of\nfactors including supply and demand for the particular index (or\nthe components of the index, as applicable) to which the note\nis linked and economic and political events over which Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings has no control. Fluctuations in the\nprice or level of any index that have occurred in the past are\nnot indicative of fluctuations that may occur during the term\nof any indexed notes.\n\nProspective investors should consult their own financial and\nlegal advisors as to the risks of an investment in\nindexed notes.\n\nSupplemental Provisions Relating to Non-U.S. DollarNotes\n\nPublic Offering Price\n\nThe U.S. dollar\nequivalent of the public offering price or purchase price of a\nnote having a specified currency other than U.S. dollars will be\ndetermined on the basis of the market exchange rate. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering\nof notes, this market exchange rate will be the noon buying rate\nin New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies as\ncertified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York for such specified currency on the applicable issue\ndate. Such determination will be made by Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings or its agent, as the exchange rate agent for\nthe applicable offering of notes.\n\nPayment of Principal and Interest\n\nThe\napplicable supplement for a note may provide that Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings will make one or more payments on such\nnote in a currency other than U.S. dollars. If the applicable\nsupplement provides for payment in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars and the note is held by DTC as a global security,\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings will, unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable supplement, arrange to convert all\npayments in respect of the note into U.S. dollars in the manner\ndescribed in the following paragraph.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, the amount of any\nU.S. dollar payment on a note having a specified currency other\nthan U.S. dollars that provides for payment in a currency\n\nS-8\n\nother than U.S. dollars and that is held by DTC as a global\nsecurity will be determined by the exchange rate agent:\n                                                                \n      based on the specified currency/U.S. dollar exchange      \n      rate prevailing at 11:00 a.m., London, England time, on   \n      the                                                       \n      second exchange rate business day prior to the            \n      applicable payment date, or                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      if an exchange rate bid quotation is not so available,    \n      the exchange rate agent will obtain a bid quotation from  \n      a                                                         \n      leading foreign exchange bank in London, England          \n      selected by the exchange rate agent after consultation    \n      with Citigroup Global Markets Holdings.                   \n                                                                \nThe exchange rate agent will also determine prior to settlement\nthe aggregate amount of the specified currency payable on a\npayment date for all notes denominated and payable in the\nspecified currency.

The amounts\nso payable on any date in such currency shall be converted into\nU.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market\nexchange rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated in the\napplicable supplement. Any payment on such note made under such\ncircumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default or\nan event of default under the indenture under which such note\nwas issued. If the specified currency of a note is officially\nredenominated, other than as a result of the European Monetary\nUnion, such as by an official redenomination of any such\nspecified currency that is a composite currency, then the\npayment obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings on such\nnote will be the amount of redenominated currency that\nrepresents the amount of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092\nobligations immediately before the redenomination. The notes\nwill not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under\nsuch notes as a result of:\n                                                                \n      any change in the value of the specified currency of      \n      such notes relative to any other currency due solely to   \n      fluctuations in exchange rates; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      any redenomination of any component currency of any       \n      composite currency, unless such composite currency is     \n      itself                                                    \n      officially redenominated.                                 \n                                                                \nFor a description of the European Monetary Union, see \u0093European\nMonetary Union\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus and any\ndisclosure on the European Monetary Union in an applicable\nsupplement. Currently, there are limited facilities in the\nUnited States for conversion of U.S. dollars into foreign\ncurrencies, and vice versa. In addition, banks do not generally\noffer non-U.S.dollar-denominated checking or savings account\nfacilities in the United States. Accordingly, payments on notes\nmade in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be made from an\naccount at a bank located outside the United States, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. S-9\n\nEach note that has a specified currency of pounds sterling will\nmature in compliance with the regulations the Bank of England\nmay promulgate from time to time. Alternative Book-Entry\nProcedures and Settlement If Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\nissues notes which provide for one or more payments to be made\nin a non-U.S.currency, the applicable supplement may specify\nthat such notes will be cleared through Euroclear Bank SA/NV\n(\u0093Euroclear\u0094) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094),\nrather than through DTC. Such notes may be issued either under\nthe New Safekeeping Structure (the \u0093NSS\u0094) or the Classic\nSafekeeping Structure (the \u0093CSS\u0094). Notes issued under the NSS\nwill be registered in the name of a nominee of a common\nsafekeeper for Euroclear and Clearstream. Notes issued under the\nCSS will be registered in the name of a nominee of a common\ndepositary. Such common safekeeper or common depositary, as\napplicable, will be the depositary for such notes. The European\nCentral Bank has announced that notes issued under the NSS will\nbe in compliance with the \u0093Standards for the use of EU\nsecurities settlement systems in ESCB credit operations\u0094 of the\nEurosystem, provided that certain other criteria are fulfilled.\nIf such other eligibility criteria are fulfilled, notes issued\nunder the NSS will be eligible to be pledged as collateral in\nEurosystem operations (\u0093Eurosystem eligible\u0094). Notes issued\nunder the CSS will not be Eurosystem eligible. Supplemental\nProvisions Relating to Floating Rate Notes Each floating rate\nnote will bear interest at the interest rate set forth, or\notherwise described, in the applicable supplement. An interest\nperiod is the period from each interest reset date to, but not\nincluding, the following interest reset date; provided that the\ninitial interest period is the period from the original issue\ndate to, but not including, the first interest reset date.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, each\ninterest payment date for a floating rate note will be an\ninterest reset date for that note. The interest rate for each\nfloating rate note will be determined based on a simple per\nannum, interest rate basis and will be equal to, the base rate,\nplus or minus any spread, or multiplied by any spread\nmultiplier. A basis point, or bp, equals one-hundredthof a\npercentage point. The spread is the number of basis points\nspecified in the applicable supplement. The spread multiplier is\nthe percentage specified in the applicable supplement and the\nspread or spread multiplier on floating rate notes may be\nadjusted from time to time. As specified in the applicable\nsupplement, a floating rate note may have either or both of the\nfollowing, which will be expressed as a rate per annum on a\nsimple interest rate basis:\n                                                                \n      maximum interest rate, which will be a maximum            \n      limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest     \n      may accrue                                                \n      during any interest period; and/or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      minimum interest rate, which will be a minimum            \n      limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest may   \n      accrue                                                    \n      during any interest period.                               \n                                                                \nIn addition to any maximum interest rate that may be applicable\nto any floating rate note, the interest rate on a floating rate\nnote will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted\nby applicable law. The notes will be governed by the law of the\nState of New York. As of the date of this prospectus supplement,\nthe maximum rate of interest under provisions of the New York\npenal law, with a few exceptions, is 25% per annum on a simple\ninterest basis. Such maximum rate of interest only applies to\nobligations that have an aggregate principal amount that is less\nthan $2,500,000. Additional Base Rates The interest rate on each\nfloating rate note will be reset on an interest reset date,\nwhich means that the interest rate is reset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually, as specified in\nthe applicable supplement. S-10\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement:\n                                                                \n      if an interest reset date for any floating rate note      \n      would fall on a day that is not a business day, such      \n      interest reset date will be postponed to the next         \n      succeeding business day.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      in the case of a LIBOR note or a EURIBOR note, if         \n      postponement to the next business day would cause the     \n      interest                                                  \n      reset date to be in the next succeeding calendar month,   \n      the interest reset date will instead be the immediately   \n      preceding business day.                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      if an auction of direct obligations of United States      \n      Treasury bills falls on a day that is an interest reset   \n      date                                                      \n      for Treasury Rate notes, the interest reset date will be  \n      the succeeding business day.                              \n                                                                \nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement and\nexcept as set forth below, the rate of interest that goes into\neffect on any interest reset date will be determined on an\ninterest determination date preceding such interest reset date,\nas further described in the applicable supplement. Unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement, interest\npayable on floating rate notes will be the interest accrued from\nand including the original issue date or the last date to which\ninterest has been paid, as the case may be, to but excluding the\napplicable interest payment date. Accrued interest on a floating\nrate note with more than one interest reset date will be\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount of the note by an\naccrued interest factor. If the floating rate note is an indexed\nnote, the stated principal amount of the note will be multiplied\nby the accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will\nbe computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each\nday in the period for which accrued interest is being\ncalculated. The interest factor for each such day will be\ncomputed by dividing the interest rate in effect on such day by\nthe number of days specified in the applicable pricing\nsupplement. The interest factor will be expressed as a decimal\ncalculated to seven decimal places without rounding. For\npurposes of making the foregoing calculation, the interest rate\nin effect on any interest reset date will be the applicable rate\nas reset on such date. For all other floating rate notes,\naccrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal\namount of the note by the interest rate in effect during the\nperiod for which accrued interest is being calculated. That\nproduct is then multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing\nthe number of days in the period for which accrued interest is\nbeing calculated by the number of days specified in the\napplicable pricing supplement. Upon the request of the holder of\nany floating rate note, the calculation agent for such note will\nprovide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the\ninterest rate that will become effective on the next interest\nreset date for such floating rate note. No Securities Exchange\nListing Unless otherwise specified in connection with a\nparticular offering of debt securities, the notes will not be\nlisted on any U.S. or international securities exchange.\nCombination of Provisions If so specified in the applicable\nsupplement, any note may be required to comply with all of the\nprovisions, or any combination of the provisions, described\nherein or in the accompanying prospectus. Optional Redemption,\nRepayment and Repurchase If so specified in the applicable\nsupplement relating to a note, such note can be redeemed at the\noption of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings, in whole or in\npart, prior to its stated maturity. If applicable, such\nsupplement will also indicate (1) the optional redemption date\nor dates on which such note may be redeemed and (2) the\nredemption price at which such note may be redeemed on each such\noptional redemption date. S-11\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, at least 3 days prior to the date of\nredemption, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings will provide\nnotice of such redemption to the trustee, and we or the trustee\n(at our request) will provide notice of such redemption to the\nholder of such note (which shall be the depositary for so long\nas the notes are held in book-entry form) in accordance with\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities \u0097 Book Entry Procedures and\nSettlement \u0097 Notices\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\nnotes, Citigroup Global Markets Holdings may exercise such\noption relating to a redemption of a note in part only by\nnotifying the trustee for such note at least 35 days prior to\nany optional redemption date. In the event of redemption of a\nnote in part only, a new note or notes for the unredeemed\nportion of such note or notes will be issued to the holder of\nsuch note or notes upon the cancellation of such note or notes.\nIf so specified in the applicable supplement relating to a note,\nthe holder of such note will have the option to elect repayment\nof such note by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings prior to its\nstated maturity. If applicable, such supplement will specify (1)\nthe optional repayment date or dates on which such note may be\nrepaid and (2) the optional repayment price at which such note\nmay be repaid on each such optional repayment date. Subject to\nthe terms set forth in the applicable supplement, in order for a\nnote to be repaid, the trustee must receive, at least 35 days\nprior to an optional repayment date:\n                                                                \n       such note with the form entitled \u0093Option to Elect         \n  (1)  Repayment\u0094 on the reverse of such note duly               \n       completed; or                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, electronic    \n       mail correspondence or letter from a member of a         \n  (2)  national                                                 \n       securities exchange or the Financial Industry            \n       Regulatory Authority, Inc. or a commercial bank or       \n       trust company in the United States setting forth:        \n                                                                \n                                            \n      the name of the holder of such note;  \n                                            \n                                                       \n      the principal amount of such note to be repaid;  \n                                                       \n                                                                \n      the certificate number or a description of the tenor and  \n      terms of such note; and                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a statement that the option to elect repayment is being   \n      exercised.                                                \n                                                                \nAny tender of a note by the holder for repayment, except\npursuant to a reset notice or an extension notice, will be\nirrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the holder\nof a note for less than the entire principal amount of such\nnote, provided, that the stated principal amount of such note\nremaining outstanding after repayment is an authorized\ndenomination. Upon such partial repayment, such note will be\ncanceled and a new note or notes for the remaining stated\nprincipal amount will be issued in the name of the holder of\nsuch repaid note. If a note is represented by a global security,\nthe depositary\u0092s nominee will be the holder of such note and,\ntherefore, will be the only entity that can exercise a right to\nrepayment. In order to ensure that the depositary\u0092s nominee will\ntimely exercise a right to repayment relating to a particular\nnote, the beneficial owner of such note must instruct the broker\nor other direct or indirect participant through which it holds\nan interest in such note to notify the depositary of its desire\nto exercise a right to repayment. Different firms have different\ncut-offtimes for accepting instructions from their customers.\nAccordingly, each beneficial owner should consult the broker or\nother direct or indirect participant through which it holds an\ninterest in a note in order to ascertain the cut-offtime by\nwhich such an instruction must be given in order for timely\nnotice to be delivered to the depositary. Except in the case of\nan optional redemption by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings at a\nstated redemption price provided for in the applicable\nsupplement, if Citigroup Global Markets Holdings redeems or\nrepays a note that is an OID note other than an indexed note\nprior to its stated maturity, then Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings will pay the amortized principal amount of the note as\nof the date of redemption or repayment regardless of anything\nelse stated in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying\nprospectus.

S-13\n\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS The following is a\ndiscussion of the material U.S. federal income and certain\nestate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the\nnotes. It applies to you only if you purchase a note for cash in\nthe initial offering at the \u0093issue price,\u0094 which is the first\nprice at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the\npublic (not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar\npersons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,\nplacement agents or wholesalers), and hold it as a capital asset\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094). Purchasers of notes at another\ntime or price should consult their tax advisers regarding the\nU.S. federal tax consequences to them of the ownership and\ndisposition of the notes. This discussion does not address all\nof the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of\nyour particular circumstances or if you are a holder subject to\nspecial rules, such as:\n                                \n      a financial institution;  \n                                \n                                       \n      a \u0093regulated investment company\u0094;  \n                                       \n                                                               \n      a tax-exempt entity, including an \u0093individual retirement  \n      account\u0094 or \u0093Roth IRA\u0094;                                     \n                                                               \n                                                                \n      a dealer or trader subject to a                           \n      mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to   \n      the notes;                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a person holding a note as part of a \u0093straddle\u0094 or          \n      conversion transaction or one who enters into a           \n      \u0093constructive sale\u0094 with respect to a note;                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a person subject to special tax accounting rules under    \n      Section\u00a0451(b) of the Code;                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional         \n      currency is not the U.S. dollar; or                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal    \n      income tax purposes.                                      \n                                                                \nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes holds the notes, the U.S. federal\nincome tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the\nstatus of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If\nyou are a partnership holding the notes or a partner in such a\npartnership, you should consult your tax adviser as to the\nparticular U.S. federal tax consequences of holding and\ndisposing of the notes to you. This discussion does not address\nthe U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership or\ndisposition of the underlying shares that you may receive at\nmaturity or otherwise upon retirement or exchange of a note. You\nshould consult your tax adviser regarding the particular U.S.\nfederal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the\nunderlying shares. We will not attempt to ascertain whether any\nissuer of any underlying shares, or shares that underlie a\nreference index, to which the notes relate (collectively, the\n\u0093Underlying Equity\u0094) should be treated as a \u0093U.S. real property\nholding corporation\u0094 (\u0093USRPHC\u0094) within the meaning of Section\n897 of the Code or a \u0093passive foreign investment company\u0094\n(\u0093PFIC\u0094) within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code. If any\nissuer of the Underlying Equity were so treated, certain adverse\nU.S. federal income tax consequences might apply to you, in the\ncase of a USRPHC if you are a Non-U.S.Holder (as defined below),\nand in the case of a PFIC if you are a U.S. Holder, upon a sale,\nexchange or other disposition of the notes. You should refer to\ninformation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or\nanother governmental authority by the issuers of the Underlying\nEquity and consult your tax adviser regarding the possible\nconsequences to you if any issuer of Underlying Equity is or\nbecomes a USRPHC or PFIC. This discussion is based on the Code,\nadministrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final,\ntemporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the date\nhereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this\nprospectus supplement may affect the tax consequences described\nherein, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does\nnot address the effects of any applicable state, local or\nnon-U.S.tax laws or the potential application of the Medicare\ncontribution tax or the alternative minimum tax. You should\nconsult your tax adviser about the application of the U.S.\nfederal income and estate tax laws (including the possibility of\nalternative treatments of the notes) to your particular\nsituation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the\nlaws of any state, local or non-U.S.jurisdiction. S-14\n\nThis discussion may be supplemented, modified or superseded by\ndisclosure regarding U.S. federal tax consequences set out in an\napplicable supplement, which you should read before making a\ndecision to invest in the relevant notes. Tax Treatment of the\nNotes This discussion applies to notes that we treat as debt\ninstruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S.\nfederal income tax treatment of other notes will be addressed in\nan applicable supplement. This disclosure generally applies to\nnotes that provide for payments solely in cash. Special tax\nconsequences may apply to notes that provide for one or more\npayments in property other than cash, and those consequences\nwill be addressed in an applicable supplement. Tax Consequences\nto U.S. Holders This section applies only to U.S. Holders. You\nare a \u0093U.S. Holder\u0094 if for U.S. federal income tax purposes you\nare a beneficial owner of the notes that is:\n                                                              \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United States;  \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      a corporation created or organized in or under the laws   \n      of the United States, any state therein or the District   \n      of Columbia; or                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject to      \n      U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.    \n                                                                \nThe discussion below is subject to, and should be read in\nconjunction with, the discussion below under \u0093\u0097Possible Taxable\nEvent.\u0094 Payments of Interest \u0093Qualified stated interest\u0094 on a\nnote (as described below under \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094)\ngenerally will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at\nthe time it accrues or is received in accordance with your\nmethod of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSpecial rules governing the treatment of interest income on\ncertain categories of notes are described below under \u0093\u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated\nas Variable Rate Debt Instruments,\u0094 \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as\nContingent Payment Debt Instruments,\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated as\nForeign Currency Debt Instruments.\u0094 Original Issue Discount A\nnote that has an \u0093issue price\u0094 that is less than its \u0093stated\nredemption price at maturity\u0094 will be treated as issued with\noriginal issue discount (\u0093OID\u0094) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes unless the discount is less than a de minimisthreshold\nunder applicable Treasury regulations. Special rules governing\nthe tax treatment of \u0093short-term notes\u0094 and \u0093contingent payment\ndebt instruments\u0094 (which are not subject to this discussion) are\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes,\u0094 and \u0093\u0097 Notes Treated\nas Contingent Payment Debt Instruments,\u0094 respectively. The\namount of OID will be equal to the excess of the stated\nredemption price at maturity over the issue price. The \u0093stated\nredemption price at maturity\u0094 of a note generally will equal the\nsum of all payments required under the note other than payments\nof \u0093qualified stated interest.\u0094 Qualified stated interest\n(\u0093QSI\u0094) generally includes stated interest unconditionally\npayable (other than in debt instruments of the issuer) at least\nannually at a single fixed rate, and also includes stated\ninterest on certain floating-rate notes (as described under \u0093\u0097\nNotes Treated as Variable Rate Debt Instruments\u0094 below). If a\nnote provides for more than one fixed rate of stated interest,\ninterest payable at the lowest stated rate generally is QSI,\nwith any excess included in the stated redemption price at\nmaturity for purposes of determining whether the note was issued\nwith OID. S-15\n\nIf the difference between a note\u0092s stated redemption price at\nmaturity and its issue\nprice is less than ade minimis threshold, as determined under\napplicable Treasury regulations, the note will not be treated as\nissued with OID and therefore will not be subject to the rules\ndescribed below. In this\ncase, all stated interest on the notes will be treated as QSI,\nand you will include the discount in income, as capital gain, on\na pro rata basis as principal payments are made on the note.\n\nIf you hold notes issued with OID (\u0093OID notes\u0094), you will be\nrequired to include any QSI in income when received or accrued,\nin\naccordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In addition, you will be required to\ninclude OID in income as it accrues, in accordance with a\nconstant-yield method based on a compounding of interest,\nregardless of\nyour method of tax accounting.\n\nUnder this method, you will be required to include in ordinary\nincome the sum of the \u0093daily portions\u0094 of OID for all days\nduring the taxable year that you own the OID note. The daily\nportions of OID are determined by allocating to each day in any\naccrual period a ratable portion of the OID on the OID note that\nis allocable to that\nperiod. Accrual periods may be any length and may vary in length\nover the term of an OID note, so long as no accrual period is\nlonger than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or\ninterest occurs on the first or last day of an accrual\nperiod. The amount of OID allocable to each accrual period is\ndetermined by (i) multiplying the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the\nOID note at the beginning of the accrual period by the annual\nyield to maturity of the OID note, adjusted to\ntake account of the length of the accrual period, and (ii)\nsubtracting from that product the amount of QSI allocable to\nthat accrual period. The \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of an OID note\nat the beginning of any accrual period will\ngenerally be the sum of its issue price and the amount of OID\nallocable to all prior accrual periods, reduced by the amount of\npayments other than QSI in all prior accrual periods. The\n\u0093annual yield to maturity\u0094 of an OID note is the\ndiscount rate that causes the present value on the issue date of\nall payments on the note to equal the issue price.\n\nYou may make an\nelection to include in gross income all interest that accrues on\nany note (including, among other things, QSI, OID and de minimis\nOID) in accordance with the constant-yield method based on the\ncompounding of interest (a\n\u0093constant-yield election\u0094). This election may be revoked only\nwith the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094).\n\nA note that is subject to early redemption may be governed by\nrules that differ from the general rules described above for\npurposes of\ndetermining its yield and maturity (which may affect whether the\nnote is treated as issued with OID and, if so, the timing of\naccrual of the OID). Under applicable Treasury regulations, we\nwill generally be presumed to exercise an option to redeem a\nnote if the exercise of the option would lower the yield on the\nnote. Conversely, you will generally be presumed to exercise an\noption to require us to repurchase a note if the exercise of the\noption would increase the yield on the note. If such an\noption is not in fact exercised, the note would be treated,\nsolely for purposes of calculating OID, as if it were redeemed\nand a new note issued on the presumed exercise date for an\namount equal to the note\u0092s adjusted issue price on that date.\nIf such a deemed reissuance occurs when the remaining term of\nthe notes is one year or less, it is possible that the note\nwould thereafter be treated as a short-term debt instrument. See\n\u0093\u0097 Short-Term Notes\u0094 below.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium\n\nIf you purchase a note (other than a contingent payment debt\ninstrument, as described below under \u0093\u0097Notes Treated as\nContingent\nPayment Debt Instruments\u0094) for an amount that is greater than\nthe sum of all amounts payable on the note after the purchase\ndate, other than payments of QSI, you generally will be\nconsidered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond\npremium equal to such excess. If the note is not optionally\nredeemable prior to its maturity date, you generally may elect\nto amortize this premium over the remaining term of the note\nusing a constant-yield method. If, however, the note may be\noptionally redeemed prior to maturity after you have acquired\nit, the amount of amortizable bond premium is generally\ndetermined by substituting the redemption date for the maturity\ndate and the redemption price for the amount payable at maturity\nbut only if the substitution results in a smaller amount of\npremium attributable to the period before the redemption date.\nYou may generally\n\nS-16\n\nuse the amortizable bond premium allocable to an accrual period\nto offset QSI required to be included in your income with\nrespect to the note in that accrual period. If you elect to\namortize bond\npremium, you must reduce your tax basis in the note by the\namount of the premium amortized in any year. An election to\namortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt instruments\nthen owned or thereafter acquired and may be revoked only with\nthe\nconsent of the IRS.\n\nIf you make a constant-yield election (as described under \u0093\u0097\nOriginal Issue Discount\u0094 above) for\na note with amortizable bond premium, that election will result\nin a deemed election to amortize bond premium for all of your\ndebt instruments with amortizable bond premium.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note\n\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will\nrecognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between\nthe amount realized\nand your tax basis in the note. For this purpose, the amount\nrealized does not include any amount attributable to accrued but\nunpaid QSI, which will be treated as a payment of interest and\ntaxed as described under \u0093\u0097 Payments of\nInterest\u0094 above. Your tax basis in a note will equal its cost,\nincreased by the amounts of any OID you have previously accrued\nwith respect to the note, if any, and decreased by any amortized\npremium and any principal payments you received\nprior to the sale or other taxable disposition of a note and by\nthe amount of any other payments on the note that did not\nconstitute QSI.\n\nGenerally, gain or loss realized upon the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of a note will be capital gain or loss and will be\nlong-term\ncapital gain or loss if you have held the note for more than one\nyear. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to\nlimitations. Exceptions to these general rules apply to short-\nterm notes, contingent payment debt instruments and foreign\ncurrency notes. See \u0093\u0097Short-Term Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Notes Treated as\nContingent Payment Debt Instruments\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Notes Treated as\nForeign Currency Debt Instruments\u0094 below.\n\nShort-Term Notes\n\nThe following discussion applies only to notes with a term of\none year or less, from but excluding the issue date to and\nincluding the last\npossible date that the notes could be outstanding pursuant to\ntheir terms (\u0093short-term notes\u0094). Generally, a short-term note\nis treated as issued at a discount equal to the sum of all\npayments required on the note minus its issue price.\n\nIf you are a cash-method U.S. Holder, you generally will not be\nrequired to recognize income with respect to a short-term note\nprior to\nmaturity, other than with respect to the receipt of interest\npayments, if any, or pursuant to a sale or other taxable\ndisposition of the note. If you are an accrual-method U.S.\nHolder (or a cash-method U.S. Holder who elects to accrue income\non the\nnote currently), you will be subject to rules that generally\nrequire accrual of discount on short-term notes on a straight-\nline basis, unless you elect a constant-yield method of accrual\nbased on daily compounding. In the case of short-term notes\nthat provide for one or more contingent payments, it is not\nclear whether or how any accrual should be determined prior to\nthe relevant valuation date for such a payment. You should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the amount and timing of any\naccruals on such notes.\n\nUpon a taxable disposition (including a sale, exchange, early\nredemption, or retirement) of a short-term note,\nyou will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount realized on the sale or other\ntaxable disposition and your tax basis in the note. Your tax\nbasis in the note should equal the amount you paid to acquire\nthe note\nincreased, if you accrue income on the notes currently, by any\npreviously accrued but unpaid discount. The amount of any\nresulting loss generally will be treated as a short-term capital\nloss, the deductibility of which is subject to limitations. The\nexcess of the amount received at maturity over your tax basis in\nthe note generally should be treated as ordinary income. If you\nsell a short-term note providing for a contingent payment at\nmaturity prior to the time the contingent payment has been\nfixed, it is not clear whether any gain you recognize should be\ntreated as ordinary income, short-term capital gain, or a\ncombination of\n\nS-17\n\nordinary income and short-term capital gain. You should consult\nyour tax adviser regarding the treatment of a taxable\ndisposition of short-term notes providing for contingent\npayments.\n\nIf you are a cash-method U.S. Holder, unless you make the\nelection to accrue income currently on a short-term note, you\nwill generally be\nrequired to defer deductions for interest paid on indebtedness\nincurred to purchase or carry the note in an amount not\nexceeding the accrued discount that you have not included in\nincome. As discussed above, in the case of a short-term note\nproviding for a contingent payment, it is unclear whether or how\naccrual of discount should be determined prior to the relevant\nvaluation date in respect of the payment. If you make the\nelection to accrue income currently, that election will apply\nto all short-term debt instruments acquired by you on or after\nthe first day of the first taxable year to which that election\napplies. You should consult your tax adviser regarding these\nrules.\n\nNotes Treated as Variable Rate Debt Instruments\n\nThe following discussion applies only to floating-rate notes\nthat are treated as variable rate debt instruments for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes (\u0093VRDIs\u0094).\n\nInterest on VRDIs That Provide for a Single Variable Rate.\nStated interest on a VRDI that provides\nfor a single variable rate (a \u0093single-rate VRDI\u0094) will be\ntreated as QSI and will be taxable to you as ordinary interest\nincome at the time it accrues or is received, in accordance with\nyour method of tax accounting. If the stated\nprincipal amount of a single-rate VRDI exceeds its issue price\nby at least a specifiedde minimis amount, this excess will be\ntreated as OID that you must include in income as it accrues in\naccordance with a constant-yield\nmethod based on compounding of interest before the receipt of\ncash payments attributable to this income (as described above\nunder \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094). If a VRDI provides for\nstated interest at a fixed rate for an initial\nperiod of one year or less followed by a variable rate and the\nvariable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate the\nfixed rate (which will be presumed if the value of the variable\nrate on the issue date does not differ from the value of\nthe fixed rate by more than 0.25%), the two rates will be\ntreated for purposes of this and the next paragraph as a single\nvariable rate.\n\nInterest on VRDIs That Provide for Multiple Rates. This\ndiscussion refers to VRDIs that provide for (i) multiple\nvariable rates or\n(ii) one or more variable rates and a single fixed rate as\n\u0093multiple-rate VRDIs.\u0094 Under applicable Treasury regulations, in\norder to determine the amount of QSI and OID in respect of\nmultiple-rate VRDIs, an equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument must be constructed. The equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument is constructed in the following manner: (i) first, if\nthe multiple-rate VRDI contains a fixed rate, that fixed rate is\nconverted to a variable rate that preserves the\nfair market value of the note and (ii) second, each variable\nrate (including a variable rate determined under (i) above) is\nconverted to a fixed rate substitute (which will generally be\nthe value of that variable rate as of the issue date\nof the multiple-rate VRDI) (the \u0093equivalent fixed-rate debt\ninstrument\u0094). The rules discussed in \u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount\u0094\nare then applied to the equivalent fixed-rate debt instrument to\ndetermine the amount, if any,\nof OID and the timing of accrual of any OID. You will be\nrequired to include the OID in income for federal income tax\npurposes as it accrues, in accordance with a constant-yield\nmethod based on compounding of interest, as described above\nunder\n\u0093\u0097 Original Issue Discount.\u0094 QSI on a multiple-rate VRDI will\ngenerally be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the\ntime it accrues or is received, in accordance with your method\nof tax accounting. If a multiple-rate\nVRDI is not issued with OID, all stated interest on the\nmultiple-rate VRDI will be treated as QSI.\n\nIf the amount of interest you receive\nin a calendar year is greater than the interest assumed to be\npaid or accrued under the equivalent fixed-rate debt instrument,\nthe excess is generally treated as additional QSI taxable to you\nas ordinary income. Otherwise, any difference will\ngenerally reduce the amount of QSI you are treated as receiving\nand will therefore reduce the amount of ordinary income you are\nrequired to take into income.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of a VRDI. Upon the sale or\nother taxable disposition of a VRDI, you generally will\nrecognize capital\ngain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized\n(other than\n\nS-18\n\namounts attributable to accrued but unpaid QSI, which will be\ntreated as a payment of interest) and your tax basis in the\nVRDI. Your tax basis in a VRDI will equal the amount you paid to\npurchase the VRDI, increased by the amounts of OID (if any) you\npreviously included in income with respect to the VRDI, and\nreduced by any payments other than QSI you received and any\namortized premium. Your gain or loss generally will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if you held the VRDI for more than one year\nat the time of disposition. Notes Treated as Contingent Payment\nDebt Instruments The following discussion applies only to notes\ntreated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes (\u0093CPDIs\u0094). Interest Accruals on the CPDIs.\nWe are required to determine a \u0093comparable yield\u0094 for each\nissuance of CPDIs. The \u0093comparable yield\u0094 is the yield at which\nwe could issue a fixed-rate debt instrument with terms similar\nto those of the CPDIs, including the level of subordination,\nterm, timing of payments and general market conditions, but\nexcluding any adjustments for the riskiness of the contingencies\nor the liquidity of the CPDIs. Solely for purposes of\ndetermining the amount of interest income that you will be\nrequired to accrue, we are also required to construct a\n\u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 in respect of the CPDIs\nrepresenting a payment or a series of payments the amount and\ntiming of which would produce a yield to maturity on the CPDIs\nequal to the comparable yield. Neither the comparable yield nor\nthe projected payment schedule constitutes a representation by\nus regarding the actual amounts that we will pay on the CPDIs.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, you are required to use\nour determination of the comparable yield and projected payment\nschedule in determining interest accruals and adjustments in\nrespect of the CPDIs, unless you timely disclose and justify the\nuse of other estimates to the IRS. Regardless of your method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be\nrequired to accrue, as interest income, OID on the CPDIs at the\ncomparable yield, adjusted upward or downward to reflect the\ndifference, if any, between the actual and the projected\npayments on the CPDIs during the year (as described below). You\nwill be required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to accrue\nan amount of OID, for each accrual period prior to and including\nthe maturity (or earlier sale or other taxable disposition) of a\nCPDI, that equals the product of (i) the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094\nof the CPDI (as defined below) as of the beginning of the\naccrual period, (ii) the comparable yield of the CPDI, adjusted\nfor the length of the accrual period and (iii) the number of\ndays during the accrual period that you held the CPDI divided by\nthe number of days in the accrual period. The adjusted issue\nprice of a CPDI is its issue price increased by any interest\nincome you have previously accrued (determined without regard to\nadjustments due to differences between projected and actual\npayments) and decreased by the projected amounts of any payments\npreviously made on the CPDI (without regard to actual amounts\npaid). Adjustments to Interest Accruals on the CPDIs. In\naddition to interest accrued based upon the comparable yield as\ndescribed above, you will be required to recognize interest\nincome equal to the amount of any net positive adjustment (\ni.e., the excess of actual payments over projected payments) in\nrespect of a CPDI for a taxable year. A net negative adjustment\n( i.e., the excess of projected payments over actual payments)\nin respect of a CPDI for a taxable year:\n                                                                \n      will first reduce the amount of interest in respect of    \n      the CPDI that you would otherwise be required to include  \n      in income in the taxable year; and                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      to the extent of any excess, will give rise to an         \n      ordinary loss, but only to the extent that the amount of  \n      all                                                       \n      previous interest inclusions under the CPDI exceeds the   \n      total amount of the net negative adjustments treated as   \n      ordinary loss on the CPDI in prior taxable years.         \n                                                                \nS-19\n\nA net negative adjustment is not treated as a miscellaneous\nitemized deduction (for which\ndeductions would be unavailable or, beginning in 2026, available\nonly to a limited extent). Any net negative adjustment in excess\nof the amounts described above may be carried forward to offset\nfuture interest income in respect of the CPDI or to\nreduce the amount realized on a sale or other taxable\ndisposition of the CPDI.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of the CPDIs.\nUpon a sale or other taxable disposition of a CPDI, you\ngenerally will recognize taxable income or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount received and your tax basis in the\nCPDI. Your tax basis in the CPDI will equal your purchase price\nfor\nthe CPDI, increased by any interest income you have previously\naccrued (determined without regard to adjustments due to\ndifferences between projected and actual payments) and decreased\nby the projected amounts of any payments previously made on the\nCPDI (without regard to actual amounts paid). At maturity, you\nwill be treated as receiving the projected amount for that date,\nand any difference between the amount actually received and that\nprojected amount will be treated as a positive or\nnegative adjustment governed by the rules described above under\n\u0093\u0097 Adjustments to Interest Accruals on the CPDIs.\u0094 As described\nabove, the amount you are treated as receiving upon a\ndisposition of a CPDI, whether at or prior to\nmaturity, will be reduced by any carryforward of a net negative\nadjustment. You generally must treat any income as interest\nincome and any loss as ordinary loss to the extent of previous\ninterest inclusions (reduced by the total amount of net\nnegative adjustments previously taken into account as ordinary\nlosses), and the balance as capital loss. These losses are not\ntreated as miscellaneous itemized deductions. The deductibility\nof capital losses is, however, subject to limitations.\nAdditionally, if you recognize a loss above certain thresholds,\nyou may be required to file a disclosure statement with the IRS,\nas described below under \u0093Reportable Transactions.\u0094 You should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding this\nreporting obligation.\n\nSpecial Rules for Contingent Payments that Fix Early. Special\nrules may apply if all the remaining payments\non a CPDI become fixed substantially contemporaneously. For this\npurpose, payments will be treated as fixed if the remaining\ncontingencies with respect to them are remote or incidental.\nUnder these rules, you would be required to account for the\ndifference between the originally projected payments and the\nfixed payments in a reasonable manner over the period to which\nthe difference relates. In addition, you would be required to\nmake adjustments to, among other things, your accrual periods\nand your tax basis in the CPDI. The character of any gain or\nloss on a sale or other taxable disposition of your CPDI also\nmight be affected. If one or more (but not all) contingent\npayments on a CPDI became fixed more than six months prior to\nthe\nrelevant payment dates, you would be required to account for the\ndifference between the originally projected payments and the\nfixed payments on a present value basis. You should consult your\ntax adviser regarding the application of these rules.\n\nNotes Treated as Foreign Currency Debt Instruments\n\nGeneral. The following discussion describes certain special\nrules applicable to you if you hold notes that are denominated\nin a single\nspecified currency other than the U.S. dollar or the payments of\ninterest and principal on which are payable in (or determined by\nreference to) a single specified currency other than the U.S.\ndollar, which we refer to as \u0093foreign currency\nnotes.\u0094 This discussion does not address currency-linked notes\nor foreign currency notes that provide for contingent payments\nor payments in or by reference to multiple currencies, which\nwill be discussed in an applicable supplement.\n\nThe rules applicable to notes that are denominated in a currency\nother than the U.S. dollar could require some or all of the gain\nor loss\nrealized upon a sale or other taxable disposition of the notes\nthat is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates\n(\u0093foreign currency gain or loss\u0094) to be treated as ordinary\nincome or loss. The rules applicable to foreign\ncurrency notes are complex, and their application may depend on\nyour circumstances. For example, various elections are available\nunder these rules, and whether you should make any of these\nelections may depend on your particular U.S. federal income\ntax situation. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and\ndisposition of foreign currency notes.\n\nS-20\n\nPayments of Interest on Foreign Currency Notes. If you use the\ncash method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and receive a\npayment of QSI (or proceeds from a sale or other taxable\ndisposition attributable to accrued QSI) in a foreign currency\nwith respect to a foreign currency note, you will be required to\ninclude in income the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency\npayment (determined based on a spot rate on the date the payment\nis received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact\nconverted to U.S. dollars at that time, and this U.S. dollar\nvalue will be your tax basis in the foreign currency received.\nIf you are a cash method holder and you receive a payment of QSI\nin U.S. dollars, you should include the amount of this payment\nin income upon receipt. If you are a cash method holder\nand you are required to accrue OID on a foreign currency note,\nrules similar to the rules described in the following paragraph\nwill apply with respect to the OID.\n\nIf you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, you will be required to include in income\nthe U.S. dollar\nvalue of the amount of interest income (including OID, but\nreduced by amortizable bond premium to the extent applicable)\nthat has accrued and is otherwise required to be taken into\naccount with respect to a foreign currency note during an\naccrual\nperiod. The U.S. dollar value of the accrued income will be\ndetermined by translating the income at an average rate of\nexchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual\nperiod that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the\npartial period within the taxable year. In addition to the\ninterest income accrued as described above, you will recognize\nordinary foreign currency gain or loss (which generally will not\nbe treated as interest income or expense) with respect to\naccrued interest income on the date the interest payment or\nproceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition\nattributable to accrued interest (or OID) is actually received.\nThe amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized will\nequal the\ndifference between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency\npayment received (determined based on a spot rate on the date\nthe payment is received) in respect of the accrual period (or,\nwhere you receive U.S. dollars, the amount of the payment\nin respect of the accrual period) and the U.S. dollar value of\ninterest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as\ndetermined above). You may elect to translate interest income\n(including OID) for an interest accrual period into U.S.\ndollars at the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual\nperiod (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the last\nday of the taxable year) or, if the date of receipt is within\nfive business days of the last day of the interest accrual\nperiod, the spot rate on the date of receipt. You must apply\nthis election consistently to all debt instruments from year to\nyear and cannot change the election without the consent of the\nIRS.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium on Foreign Currency Notes. Amortizable\nbond premium on a foreign currency note is determined in the\nrelevant\nforeign currency.\n\nIf you elect to amortize bond premium, amortizable bond premium\ntaken into account on a current basis will reduce\ninterest income in units of the relevant foreign currency. You\nwill realize ordinary foreign currency gain or loss with respect\nto amortized bond premium with respect to any period by treating\nthat amortized bond premium in the same manner as a\nreturn of principal on the sale or other taxable disposition of\na foreign currency note (as discussed below). If the election is\nnot made, any loss realized on the sale, exchange or retirement\nof a foreign currency note will be capital loss to the\nextent of the bond premium.\n\nTax Basis in Foreign Currency Notes. Your tax basis in a foreign\ncurrency note, or the amount of any\nsubsequent adjustment to your tax basis, will be the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the foreign currency amount paid for the note, or of\nthe foreign currency amount of the adjustment, determined on the\ndate of the purchase or adjustment. If you purchase a\nforeign currency note with previously owned foreign currency,\nyou will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between your tax basis in the foreign\ncurrency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of the\nforeign currency note on the date of purchase.\n\nSale or Other Taxable Disposition of Foreign Currency Notes.\nForeign currency gain\nor loss recognized upon the sale or other taxable disposition\n(including retirement) of a foreign currency note will be\nordinary income or loss that generally is not treated as\ninterest income or expense. The amount of foreign currency gain\nor loss\ngenerally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar\nvalue of your purchase price (reduced by any bond premium\npreviously amortized as described above) in the foreign currency\nof the note, (i) determined on\n\nS-21\n\nthe date the payment is received in exchange for the note or the\nnote is disposed of, and (ii) determined on the date you\nacquired the note. Amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid\ninterest will be treated as payments of interest on foreign\ncurrency notes as described above. Foreign currency gain or loss\nrealized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any\nforeign currency note will be recognized only to the extent of\nthe total gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of the foreign currency note. Any gain or loss\nrealized in excess of the foreign currency gain or loss will be\ncapital gain or loss (except in the case of a short-term note,\nto the extent of any discount not previously included in your\nincome). If you recognize a loss upon a sale or other\ndisposition of a foreign currency note above certain thresholds,\nyou may be subject to certain reporting requirements, as\ndescribed below under \u0093Reportable Transactions.\u0094 If you are a\ncash-method taxpayer who buys or sells a foreign currency note\nthat is traded on an established market, you will be required to\ntranslate units of foreign currency paid or received into U.S.\ndollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase\nor sale. Accordingly, no exchange gain or loss will result from\ncurrency fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement\nof the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual-method taxpayer,\nyou may elect the same treatment for all purchases and sales of\nforeign currency obligations traded on established securities\nmarkets. This election cannot be changed without the consent of\nthe IRS. You will have a tax basis in any foreign currency\nreceived on the sale or other taxable disposition of a foreign\ncurrency note equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign\ncurrency, determined at the time of the sale or other taxable\ndisposition. Any gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of\nforeign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its\nuse to purchase foreign currency notes) will be ordinary income\nor loss. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S.Holders This section\napplies only to Non-U.S.Holders. You are a \u0093Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 if\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes you are a beneficial owner\nof a note that is:\n                                                               \n      an individual who is classified as a nonresident alien;  \n                                                               \n                                 \n      a foreign corporation; or  \n                                 \n                                  \n      a foreign trust or estate.  \n                                  \nYou are not a Non-U.S.Holder for purposes of this discussion if\nyou are (i) an individual who is present in the United States\nfor 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, or (ii)\na former citizen or resident of the United States and certain\nconditions apply. If you are or may become such a person during\nthe period in which you hold a note, you should consult your tax\nadviser regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the notes. The discussion below is subject to, and\nshould be read in conjunction with, the discussion below under\n\u0093\u0097Possible Taxable Event.\u0094 Subject to the possible application\nof Section 897 of the Code (see \u0093FIRPTA\u0094 below) and the\ndiscussions below under \u0093Possible Withholding Under Section\n871(m) of the Code\u0094 and \u0093FATCA,\u0094 you generally should not be\nsubject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax in respect of\npayments on or amounts you receive on a sale or other taxable\ndisposition of a note, provided that (i) income in respect of\nthe notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a\ntrade or business in the United States, and (ii) you provide an\nappropriate IRS Form W-8to the applicable withholding agent\ncertifying under penalties of perjury that you are not a United\nStates person. We will not be required to pay any additional\namounts with respect to U.S. federal withholding taxes. If you\nare engaged in a U.S. trade or business, and if income from the\nnotes is effectively connected with your conduct of that trade\nor business, you generally will be subject to regular U.S.\nfederal income tax with respect to that income in the same\nmanner as if you were a U.S. Holder, subject to the provisions\nof an applicable income tax treaty. In that event, if you are a\ncorporation, you should also consider the potential application\nof a 30% (or lower treaty rate) branch profits tax. S-22\n\nPossible Withholding Under Section 871(m) of the Code Section\n871(m) of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder\n(\u0093Section 871(m)\u0094) impose a 30% (or lower treaty rate)\nwithholding tax on \u0093dividend equivalents\u0094 paid or deemed paid to\nNon-U.S.Holders with respect to certain financial instruments\nlinked to U.S. equities (\u0093Underlying Securities\u0094), as defined\nunder the applicable Treasury regulations, or indices that\ninclude Underlying Securities. Section 871(m) generally applies\nto \u0093specified equity-linked instruments\u0094 (\u0093Specified ELIs\u0094),\nwhich are financial instruments that substantially replicate the\neconomic performance of one or more Underlying Securities, as\ndetermined based on tests set forth in the applicable Treasury\nregulations and discussed further below. Section 871(m) provides\ncertain exceptions to this withholding regime, in particular for\ninstruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet\nrequirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations\n(\u0093Qualified Indices\u0094) as well as exchange-traded funds that\ntrack such indices (\u0093Qualified Index Securities\u0094). Although the\nSection 871(m) regime became effective in 2017, Treasury\nregulations, as modified by an IRS notice, phase in the\napplication of Section 871(m) as follows:\n                                                                \n      For financial instruments issued prior to 2023, Section\u00a0  \n      871(m) will generally apply only to financial             \n      instruments that have a \u0093delta\u0094 of one.                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      For financial instruments issued in 2023 and thereafter,  \n      Section\u00a0871(m) will apply if either (i)\u00a0the               \n      \u0093delta\u0094 of the relevant financial instrument is at least    \n      0.80, if it is a \u0093simple\u0094 contract, or (ii)\u00a0the financial   \n      instrument meets a \u0093substantial equivalence\u0094 test, if it    \n      is a \u0093complex\u0094 contract.                                    \n                                                                \n\u0093Delta\u0094 is generally defined as the ratio of the change in the\nfair market value of a financial instrument to a small change in\nthe fair market value of the number of shares of the Underlying\nSecurity. The \u0093substantial equivalence\u0094 test measures whether a\ncomplex contract tracks its \u0093initial hedge\u0094 (shares of the\nUnderlying Security that would fully hedge the contract) more\nclosely than would a \u0093benchmark\u0094 simple contract with a delta of\n0.80. The calculations are generally made at the \u0093calculation\ndate,\u0094 which is the earlier of (i) the time of pricing of the\nnote, i.e., when all material terms have been agreed on, and\n(ii) the issuance of the note. However, if the time of pricing\nis more than 14 calendar days before the issuance of the note,\nthe calculation date is the date of the issuance of the note. In\nthose circumstances, information regarding our final\ndeterminations for purposes of Section 871(m) may be available\nonly after the time of pricing of the note. As a result, you\nshould acquire such a Note only if you are willing to accept the\nrisk that the note is treated as a Specified ELI subject to\nwithholding under Section 871(m). If the terms of a note are\nsubject to a \u0093significant modification\u0094 (for example, upon an\nevent discussed below under \u0093\u0097Possible Taxable Event\u0094), the note\ngenerally will be treated as reissued for this purpose at the\ntime of the significant modification, in which case the notes\ncould become Specified ELIs at that time. If a note is a\nSpecified ELI, withholding in respect of dividend equivalents\nwill, depending on the applicable withholding agent\u0092s\ncircumstances, generally be required either (i) on the\nunderlying dividend payment date or (ii) when cash payments are\nmade on the note or upon the date of maturity, lapse or other\ndisposition of the note by you, or possibly upon certain other\nevents. Depending on the circumstances, the applicable\nwithholding agent may withhold the required amounts from\npayments on the note, from proceeds of the retirement or other\ndisposition of the note, or from your other cash or property\nheld by the withholding agent. The dividend equivalent amount\nwill include the amount of any actual or, under certain\ncircumstances, estimated dividend. If the dividend equivalent\namount is based on the actual dividend, it will be equal to the\nproduct of: (i) in the case of a \u0093simple\u0094 contract, the per-\nsharedividend amount, the number of shares of an Underlying\nSecurity and the delta; or (ii) in the case of a \u0093complex\u0094\ncontract, the per-sharedividend amount and the initial hedge.\nThe dividend equivalent amount for Specified ELIs issued prior\nto 2023 that have a \u0093delta\u0094 of S-23\n\none will be calculated in the same manner as (i) above, using a\n\u0093delta\u0094 of one. The per-share dividend amount will be the actual\ndividend\n(including any special dividends) paid with respect to a share\nof the Underlying Security. If the dividend equivalent amount is\nbased on an estimated dividend, an applicable supplement will\ngenerally state the estimated amounts.\n\nDepending on the terms of a note and whether or not it is issued\nprior to 2023, an applicable supplement may contain additional\ninformation\nrelevant to Section 871(m), such as whether the note references\na Qualified Index or Qualified Index Security; whether it is a\n\u0093simple\u0094 contract; the \u0093delta\u0094 and the number of shares\nmultiplied by delta (for a simple\ncontract); and whether the \u0093substantial equivalence test\u0094 is met\nand the initial hedge (for a complex contract).\n\nProspective\npurchasers of the notes should consult their tax advisers\nregarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to a\nparticular note. Our determination is binding on Non-U.S.\nHolders, but it is not\nbinding on the IRS. The Section 871(m) regulations require\ncomplex calculations to be made with respect to notes linked to\nU.S. equities and their application to a specific issue of notes\nmay be uncertain. Accordingly, even if we determine that\ncertain notes are not Specified ELIs, the IRS could challenge\nour determination and assert that withholding is required in\nrespect of those notes. Moreover, your consequences under\nSection 871(m) may depend on your particular circumstances. For\nexample, if you enter into other transactions relating to an\nUnderlying Security, you could be subject to withholding tax or\nincome tax liability under Section 871(m) even if the notes are\nnot Specified ELIs subject to Section 871(m) as a\ngeneral matter. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisers regarding the application of Section 871(m) in their\nparticular circumstances.\n\nFIRPTA\n\nSection 897 of the Code, commonly referred to as \u0093FIRPTA,\u0094\napplies to certain interests in entities that beneficially own\nsignificant amounts of United States real property interests\n(each, a \u0093USRPI\u0094). As discussed above, we will not attempt to\nascertain whether any issuer of the Underlying Equity should be\ntreated as a USRPHC for purposes of Section 897\nof the Code (including a non-corporate entity treated for\nrelevant purposes of Section 897 of the Code as a USRPHC). If a\nrelevant issuer were so treated, it is possible that, subject to\nthe exceptions\ndiscussed in the following paragraph, a note could be treated as\na USRPI, in which case any gain from the disposition of the note\nwould generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax and would\nbe required to be reported by the Non-U.S. Holder on a U.S.\nfederal income tax return, generally in the same manner as if\nthe Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, and would in certain\ncases be subject to\nwithholding in the amount of 15% of the gross proceeds of such\ndisposition.\n\nAn exception to the FIRPTA rules applies in respect of interests\nin entities\nthat have a regularly traded class of interests outstanding.\nUnder this exception, a note that is not \u0093regularly traded\u0094 on\nan established securities market generally should not be subject\nto the FIRPTA rules unless its fair market value\nupon acquisition exceeds 5% of the relevant issuer\u0092s regularly\ntraded class of interests as specified in the applicable\nTreasury regulations. In the case of notes that are regularly\ntraded, a holding of 5% or less of the outstanding notes of\nthat class or series generally should not be subject to the\nFIRPTA rules. Certain attribution and aggregation rules apply,\nand prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax\nadvisers regarding whether their ownership interest in the notes\nwill be subject to an exemption from the FIRPTA rules in light\nof their circumstances, including any other interest they might\nhave in a relevant issuer.\n\nU.S. Federal Estate Tax\n\nIf you are an individual Non-U.S. Holder or an entity the\nproperty of which is potentially includible\nin such an individual\u0092s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax\npurposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and\nwith respect to which the individual has retained certain\ninterests or powers), you should note that, absent an\napplicable treaty exemption, a note that is treated as a debt\nobligation for U.S. federal estate tax purposes generally will\nbe treated as U.S.-situs property subject to U.S. federal estate\ntax if payments on the note, if\n\nS-24\n\nreceived by the decedent at the time of death, would have been\nsubject to U.S. federal withholding or income tax (even if the\nIRS Form W-8 certification\nrequirement described above were satisfied and not taking into\naccount the elimination of such U.S. federal withholding tax due\nto the application of an income tax treaty). If you are such an\nindividual or entity, you should consult your tax adviser\nregarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the notes.\n\nPossible Taxable Event\n\nA change in the methodology by which an underlying index is\ncalculated, a change in the components of an underlying index,\nthe designation of a\nsuccessor index, the designation of a substitute or successor\nrate, an assumption of the notes (as discussed in the paragraph\nbelow) or other similar circumstances resulting in a material\nchange to an underlying or to the method by which amounts\npayable are determined on the notes could result in a\n\u0093significant modification\u0094 of the affected notes.\n\nAs provided in the\naccompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of Debt Securities \u0097\nCitigroup Guarantees,\u0094 our obligations under the notes may be\nassumed by Citigroup. We intend that Citigroup will assume the\nnotes pursuant to this provision\nonly in circumstances in which we expect to treat such an\nassumption as not giving rise to a \u0093significant modification\u0094 of\nthe notes and have been advised by our counsel that such\ntreatment is reasonable under the circumstances and the law\nin effect at the time of such assumption. However, in light of\nthe lack of clear authority regarding the treatment of such an\nassumption, there may be uncertainty regarding the correctness\nof this treatment. As a result, it is possible that the IRS\nmay treat an assumption of the notes as a significant\nmodification.\n\nA significant modification would generally result in the notes\nbeing\ntreated as terminated and reissued for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. In that event, you might be required to recognize gain\nor loss (subject to the possible application of the wash sale\nrules) with respect to the notes, and your holding period\nfor your notes could be affected. Moreover, depending on the\nfacts at the time of the significant modification, the reissued\nnotes could be characterized for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes in a manner different from their original treatment,\nwhich\ncould have a significant and potentially adverse effect on the\ntiming and character of income you recognize with respect to the\nnotes after the significant modification if you are a U.S.\nHolder, and potentially adverse withholding consequences if\nyou are a Non-U.S. Holder.\n\nYou should consult your tax adviser regarding the consequences\nof a\nsignificant modification of the notes. Except where stated\notherwise, the discussion herein assumes that there has not been\na significant modification of the notes.\n\nReportable Transactions\n\nA taxpayer that\nparticipates in a \u0093reportable transaction\u0094 is subject to\ninformation reporting requirements under Section 6011 of the\nCode. Reportable transactions include, among other things,\ncertain transactions identified by the IRS as well as\ncertain losses recognized in an amount that exceeds a specified\nthreshold level.\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\nPayments on the notes, and the proceeds of a sale, exchange or\nother disposition (including retirement) of the notes, may be\nsubject to\ninformation reporting and, if you fail to provide certain\nidentifying information (such as an accurate taxpayer\nidentification number if you are a U.S. Holder) or meet certain\nother conditions, may also be subject to backup withholding at\nthe rate\nspecified in the Code. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder that\nprovides an appropriate IRS Form W-8, you will generally\nestablish an exemption from backup withholding. Amounts\nwithheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional\ntaxes and may be refunded or credited against your U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided the relevant information is\ntimely furnished to the IRS.\n\nS-25\n\nFATCA\n\nLegislation commonly referred to as \u0093FATCA\u0094 generally imposes a\nwithholding tax of 30% on payments to certain non-U.S. entities\n(including financial intermediaries) with respect to certain\nfinancial instruments, unless various U.S. information reporting\nand due diligence requirements (that are in addition to, and\npotentially significantly more onerous than, the requirement to\ndeliver an IRS Form W-8) have been satisfied. An\nintergovernmental agreement between the United States and the\nnon-U.S. entity\u0092s jurisdiction may modify these requirements.\nThis legislation generally applies to interest on the notes and\ncertain dividend equivalents (as defined above) under Section\n871(m).\nWhile existing Treasury regulations would also require\nwithholding on payments of gross proceeds of the disposition\n(including upon retirement) of the notes, the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment has indicated in subsequent proposed regulations its\nintent to\neliminate this requirement. The U.S. Treasury Department has\nstated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations\npending their finalization. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder, or a\nU.S. Holder holding\nnotes through a non-U.S. intermediary, you should consult your\ntax adviser regarding the potential application of FATCA to the\nnotes, including the availability of certain refunds or credits.\n\nS-26\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe notes are being offered on a continuous basis by Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings through Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nas lead agent,\nand may be offered through additional or other agents named in\nthe applicable supplement. The agent or agents participating in\na particular offering of the notes and named in the applicable\nsupplement are collectively referred to as the\n\u0093agent.\u0094 The agent has agreed to use reasonable efforts to\nsolicit orders to purchase notes. Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings will have the sole right to accept orders to purchase\nnotes and may reject proposed purchases in whole or in\npart. The agent will also have the right to reject any proposed\npurchase in whole or in part. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\nreserves the right to withdraw, cancel or modify the offer made\nby this prospectus supplement, the accompanying\nprospectus or any other supplement without notice.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in connection with a particular\noffering of notes, the\nagent, acting as principal, will purchase the aggregate stated\nprincipal amount of the notes offered at the public offering\nprice stated in the applicable supplement less an underwriting\ndiscount stated in the applicable supplement. The agent may\nsell the notes to the public at the public offering price or to\nselected dealers, which may include affiliates of ours and/or\nthe agent, at the public offering price less a selling\nconcession described in the applicable supplement. If so\nspecified\nin the applicable supplement, the agent may sell the notes to\nthe public or to selected dealers at varying prices to be\ndetermined at the time of each sale, which may be at prevailing\nmarket prices, at prices related to such prevailing prices or at\nnegotiated prices. After any initial public offering of notes to\nbe resold to purchasers at a fixed public offering price, the\npublic offering price and any concession or discount may be\nchanged.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings reserves the right to sell\nnotes directly to investors on its own behalf. No commission\nwill be payable nor\nwill a discount be allowed on any sales made directly by\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings.\n\nUnless notes are issued upon the reopening of\na prior offering of notes that were listed on an exchange, no\nnote will have an established trading market when issued. Unless\notherwise specified in connection with a particular offering of\nnotes, the notes will not be listed on any securities\nexchange. The agent may make a market in the notes but is not\nobligated to do so. If the agent does make a market for a period\nof time, it may discontinue any market-making at any time\nwithout notice, at its sole discretion. There can be no\nassurance of the existence or liquidity of a secondary market\nfor any notes.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings estimates that its\nprinting, rating agency, trustees\u0092 and legal fees and other\nexpenses allocable to the offering of the notes, excluding\nunderwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately\n$4,500,000.\n\nThe agent may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning\nof the Securities Act of 1933. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\nhas agreed to\nindemnify the agent against liabilities relating to material\nmisstatements and omissions, or to contribute to payments that\nthe agent may be required to make relating to these liabilities.\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings will reimburse the agent\nfor customary legal and other expenses incurred by it in\nconnection with the offer and sale of the notes.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in\nconnection with a particular offering of notes, payment of the\npurchase price of the notes will be required to be made in\nimmediately available funds in New York City on the date of\nsettlement.\n\nConcurrently with the offering of notes through the agent as\ndescribed in this prospectus supplement, Citigroup Global\nMarkets Holdings may\nissue other securities under the indenture referred to in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nS-27\n\nA portion of the net proceeds from the sale of indexed notes or\nfloating rate notes may be\nused to hedge Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\u0092 obligations\nunder the notes. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings may hedge\n\nits obligations under the\nnotes through an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\nand Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or through unaffiliated\ncounterparties, and such counterparties may profit from such\nexpected hedging activity even if the value of the notes\ndeclines.\nThis hedging activity could affect the level or price of the\nindex or base rate to which such notes are linked and,\ntherefore, the value of and your return on the notes. For more\ninformation, see the section \u0093Use of Proceeds and Hedging\u0094\nin the accompanying prospectus and the applicable supplement.\n\nConflicts of Interest. Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc., and other broker-dealer affiliates of\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings, are members of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u0093FINRA\u0094) and may\nparticipate in offerings of the notes. Accordingly, offerings\nof the notes in which Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings\u0092 other broker-dealer affiliates\nparticipate will conform with the requirements addressing\nconflicts of interest when distributing the securities of an\naffiliate set forth in FINRA Rule 5121. Neither Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. nor any other broker-dealer affiliate of Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Holdings will sell notes to an account over which\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. or its subsidiaries have\ninvestment discretion unless Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or\nsuch broker-dealer affiliate has received specific written\napproval of the transaction from the account holder.\n\nAny agent, underwriter or dealer that is not an affiliate of\nours may presently or from time to time engage in business\ntransactions with us,\nincluding extending loans to us.\n\nThis prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and each\nother applicable supplement may be used\nby Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or other affiliates of\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings in connection with offers and\nsales of the notes offered by this prospectus supplement in\nmarket-making transactions at negotiated prices related to\nprevailing\nmarket prices at the time of sale. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nor these other affiliates may act as principal or agent in such\ntransactions.\n\nA prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the\nwebsites maintained by the agent or one or more other dealers.\nThe agent and\nother dealers may agree to allocate a number of notes for sale\nto their online brokerage account holders. The agent and other\ndealers will allocate notes to the agent and dealers that may\nmake Internet distributions on the same basis as other\nallocations. In addition, notes may be sold by the agent or\nother dealers to dealers who resell notes to online brokerage\naccount holders.\n\nCertain Selling Restrictions\n\nBrazil\n\nThe\nnotes have not been and will not be issued or publicly placed,\ndistributed, offered or negotiated in the Brazilian capital\nmarkets. None of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings, Citigroup\nand the issuance of any notes have been or will be registered\nwith the Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios (\u0093CVM\u0094) (Brazilian\nSecurities Commission). Any public offering or distribution, as\ndefined under Brazilian laws and regulations, of notes in Brazil\nis not legal without prior\nregistration under Law No. 6,385, of 7 December 1976, as\namended, and Instruction No. 400, issued by the CVM on 29\nDecember 2003, as amended. Documents relating to the offering of\nany notes, as well as information contained\ntherein, may not be supplied to the public in Brazil (as the\noffering of any such notes is not a public offering of\nsecurities in Brazil), nor be used in connection with any offer\nfor subscription or sale of notes to the public in Brazil.\nTherefore,\nthe agent has represented, warranted and agreed that it will not\noffer or sell notes in the Federative Republic of Brazil except\nin circumstances which do not constitute a public offering or\ndistribution under Brazilian laws and regulations.\n\nBolivia\n\nThe offshore notes are not\ngoverned by Bolivian legislation nor are they registered with or\nregulated by the Bolivian regulatory authorities.\n\nS-28\n\nChile The notes are being offered as of the date hereof solely\nto Qualified Investors ( Inversionistas Calificados) pursuant to\nthe private placement exemption provided by General Rule No. 336\nof the Superintendencia de Valores Y Seguros (the \u0093SVS\u0094). The\noffering of the notes has not been and will not be registered\nwith the Chilean Securities Registry or the Registry of Foreign\nSecurities of the SVS and, therefore, the notes are not subject\nto oversight by the SVS and may not be sold publicly in Chile.\nThe issuer of the notes is not obligated to make information\navailable publicly in Chile regarding the notes. The notes may\nnot be subject to a public offer until they are registered in\nthe corresponding Securities Registry. European Economic Area In\nrelation to each Member State of the European Economic Area\nwhich has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a \u0093Member\nState\u0094), with effect from and including the date on which the\nProspectus Directive is implemented in that Member State, the\nnotes have not been and will not be offered to the public (the\n\u0093Securities\u0094) in that Member State other than:\n                                                                \n  (i)  to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as     \n       defined in the Prospectus Directive;                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n        to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than  \n        qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus        \n  (ii)  Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus           \n        Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of    \n        any agent for any such offer; or                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  (iii)  in any other circumstances falling within Article      \n         3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,                      \n                                                                \nprovided that no such offer of Securities shall require\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings or any agent to publish a\nprospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or\nsupplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus\nDirective. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an\n\u0093offer to the public\u0094 in relation to any Securities in any\nMember State means the communication in any form and by any\nmeans of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and\nthe Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to\ndecide to purchase or subscribe for the Securities, as the same\nmay be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing\nthe Prospectus Directive in that Member State, and the\nexpression \u0093Prospectus Directive\u0094 means Directive 2003/71/EC (as\namended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any\nrelevant implementing measure in each Member State. This\nEuropean Economic Area selling restriction is in addition to any\nother selling restrictions set out in this prospectus supplement\nand any other applicable supplement. The accompanying prospectus\nand this prospectus supplement have been prepared, and each\nother applicable supplement will be prepared, on the basis that\nany offer of notes in any Member State will be made pursuant to\nan exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement\nto publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly any\nperson making or intending to make an offer in that Member State\nof notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in\nthe accompanying prospectus, this prospectus supplement and each\nother applicable supplement may only do so in circumstances in\nwhich no obligation arises for Citigroup Global Markets Holdings\nor any agent to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of\nthe Prospectus Directive in relation to such offer.

This prospectus supplement and any other offering\nmaterials may not be publicly distributed in Mexico. Peru The\nnotes may only be placed privately in Peru, except if such\noffering is considered a private offering under the securities\nlaws and regulations of Peru.

As a result\nof our business, we, and our\ncurrent and future affiliates, may be Parties in Interest with\nrespect to many Plans. Where we (or our affiliate) are a Party\nin Interest with respect to a Plan (either directly or by reason\nof our ownership interests in our directly or indirectly\nowned subsidiaries), the purchase and holding of the notes by or\non behalf of the Plan could be a prohibited transaction under\nSection 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless\nexemptive relief were available under an applicable\nexemption (as described below).\n\nCertain prohibited transaction class exemptions (\u0093PTCEs\u0094) issued\nby the U.S. Department of\nLabor may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect\nprohibited transactions resulting from the purchase or holding\nof the notes. Those class exemptions are PTCE 96-23 (for certain\ntransactions determined\nby in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain\ntransactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE\n91-38 (for\ncertain transactions involving bank collective investment\nfunds), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance\ncompany separate accounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for\ncertain transactions determined by independent qualified\nprofessional asset managers). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of\nERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may provide a limited\nexemption for the purchase and sale of the notes and\nrelated lending transactions, provided that neither the issuer\nof the notes nor any of its affiliates have or exercise any\ndiscretionary authority or control or render any investment\nadvice with respect to the assets of the Plan involved in\nthe transaction and provided further that the Plan pays no more,\nand receives no less, than adequate consideration in connection\nwith the transaction (the so-called \u0093service provider\nexemption\u0094). There can be no assurance that any of these\nstatutory or class exemptions will be available with respect to\ntransactions involving the notes.\n\nAccordingly, the notes may not be purchased or held by any Plan,\nany entity whose underlying assets include \u0093plan assets\u0094 by\nreason\nof any Plan\u0092s investment in the entity (a \u0093Plan Asset Entity\u0094)\nor any person investing \u0093plan assets\u0094 of any Plan, unless such\npurchaser or holder is eligible for the exemptive relief\navailable under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 or the\nservice\nprovider exemption or there is some other basis on which the\npurchase and holding of the notes will not constitute a non-\nexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the\nCode. Each\npurchaser or holder of the notes or any interest therein will be\ndeemed to have represented by its purchase or holding of the\nnotes that (a) it is not a Plan and its purchase and holding of\nthe notes is not made on behalf of or with \u0093plan\nassets\u0094 of any Plan or (b) its purchase and holding of the notes\nwill not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under\nSection 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.\n\nCertain governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of\nERISA), church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and\nnon-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (\u0093Non-\nERISA Arrangements\u0094) are not subject to these \u0093prohibited\ntransaction\u0094 rules of ERISA\nor Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules\nunder other applicable laws or regulations (\u0093Similar Laws\u0094).\nAccordingly, each such purchaser or holder of the notes shall be\nrequired to represent (and deemed to have\nrepresented by its purchase or holding of the notes) that such\npurchase and holding is not prohibited under applicable Similar\nLaws.\n\nS-33\n\nDue to the complexity of these rules, it is particularly\nimportant that fiduciaries or other\npersons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of or with\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 of any Plan consult with their counsel regarding\nthe relevant provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws\nand the availability of exemptive relief under PTCE\n96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1, 84-14, the service\nprovider exemption or some other basis on which the acquisition\nand holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited\ntransaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a\nviolation of any applicable\nSimilar Laws.\n\nThe notes are contractual financial instruments. The financial\nexposure provided by the notes is not a substitute or proxy\nfor, and is not intended as a substitute or proxy for,\nindividualized investment management or advice for the benefit\nof any purchaser or holder of the notes. The notes have not been\ndesigned and will not be administered in a manner intended to\nreflect the individualized needs and objectives of any purchaser\nor holder of the notes.\n\nEach purchaser and holder of the notes has\nexclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding\nand subsequent disposition of the notes does not violate the\nfiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or\nany applicable Similar Laws. The sale of any notes to any\nPlan or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation\nby us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an\ninvestment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to\ninvestments by\nPlans or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan\nor Non-ERISA Arrangement, or that such an investment is\nappropriate for Plans or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any\nparticular Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement.\n\nHowever, individual retirement accounts, individual retirement\nannuities and Keogh plans, as well as employee benefit plans\nthat permit\nparticipants to direct the investment of their accounts, will\nnot be permitted to purchase or hold the notes if the account,\nplan or annuity is for the benefit of an employee of Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc. or a family member and the employee\nreceives any compensation (such as, for example, an addition to\nbonus) based on the purchase of notes by the account, plan or\nannuity.\n\nS-34\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nCertain legal matters with respect to the validity of the notes\nwill be passed upon for Citigroup Global Markets Holdings by\nAlexia Breuvart,\nSecretary and General Counsel of Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings, Barbara Politi, Associate General Counsel \u0097 Capital\nMarkets of Citigroup, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, special\nproducts counsel to Citigroup Global Markets\nHoldings, and/or other counsel identified in the applicable\nsupplement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Citigroup\nSubsection (a) of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of\nthe State of Delaware, or DGCL, empowers a corporation to\nindemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to\nbe made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,\nsuit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative (other than an action by or in the right of the\ncorporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is\nor was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,\nofficer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,\njoint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid\nin settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in\nconnection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person\nacted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably\nbelieved to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the\ncorporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person\u0092s\nconduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or\nproceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a\nplea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,\ncreate a presumption that the person did not act in good faith\nand in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or\nnot opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with\nrespect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable\ncause to believe that the person\u0092s conduct was unlawful.\nSubsection (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL empowers a corporation\nto indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened\nto be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed\naction or suit by or in right of the corporation to procure a\njudgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person\nacted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by\nthe person in connection with the defense or settlement of such\naction or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner\nthe person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the\nbest interests of the corporation and except that no\nindemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or\nmatter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be\nliable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the\nCourt of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was\nbrought shall determine upon application that, despite the\nadjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances\nof the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to\nindemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such\nother court shall deem proper. II-1\n\nSubsection (d) of Section 145 of the DGCL provides that any\nindemnification under\nsubsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 (unless ordered by a\ncourt) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in\nthe specific case upon a determination that indemnification of\nthe present or former director, officer, employee\nor agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has\nmet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections\n(a) and (b) of Section 145. Such determination shall be made,\nwith respect to a person who is a director or\nofficer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority\nvote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit\nor proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a\ncommittee of such directors designated by the majority\nvote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3)\nif there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct,\nby independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the\nstockholders.\n\nSection 145 of the DGCL further provides that to the extent a\npresent or former director or officer of a corporation has been\nsuccessful\non the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or\nproceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section\n145, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such\nperson shall be indemnified against expenses\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by\nsuch person in connection therewith and that such expenses may\nbe paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition\nof such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an\nundertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay\nsuch amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such\nperson is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as\nauthorized in Section 145 of the DGCL; that any\nindemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or\ngranted pursuant to, Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive\nof any other rights to which the indemnified party may be\nentitled; that indemnification provided by, or granted pursuant\nto, Section 145 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized\nand ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the\nbenefit of such person\u0092s heirs, executors and\nadministrators; and empowers the corporation to purchase and\nmaintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or\nwas serving at the request of the corporation as a director,\nofficer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,\njoint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability\nasserted against such person and incurred by such person in any\nsuch capacity, or arising out of such person\u0092s status\nas such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to\nindemnify such person against such liabilities under Section\n145. Section Four of Article IV of Citigroup\u0092s By-Laws provides\nthat\nCitigroup shall indemnify its directors and officers to the\nfullest extent permitted by the DGCL.\n\nCitigroup also provides liability\ninsurance for its directors and officers which provides for\ncoverage against loss from claims made against directors and\nofficers in their capacity as such, including, subject to\ncertain exceptions, liabilities under the federal securities\nlaws.\n\nSection 102(b)(7) of the DGCL provides that a certificate of\nincorporation may contain a provision eliminating or limiting\nthe\npersonal liability of a director to the corporation or its\nstockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty\nas a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate\nor limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of\nthe director\u0092s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its\nstockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or\nwhich involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of\nlaw, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or\n(iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an\nimproper personal benefit. Article Tenth of Citigroup\u0092s Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation limits the liability of directors\nto the fullest extent permitted by\nSection 102(b)(7).\n\nThe directors and officers of Citigroup are covered by insurance\npolicies indemnifying them against certain\nliabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the\nSecurities Act, which might be incurred by them in such\ncapacities and against which they cannot be indemnified by\nCitigroup. Any agents, dealers or underwriters who execute any\nunderwriting or distribution agreement relating to securities\noffered pursuant to this Registration Statement will agree to\nindemnify Citigroup\u0092s directors and their officers who signed\nthe Registration Statement against certain liabilities\nthat may arise under the Securities Act with respect to\ninformation furnished to Citigroup by or on behalf of such\nindemnifying party.\n\nII-2\n\nThe foregoing is only a general summary of certain aspects of\nthe DCGL and Citigroup\u0092s\nbylaws dealing with indemnification of directors and officers,\nand does not purport to be complete. It is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the detailed provisions of Section 145\nof the DGCL and the\nby-laws of Citigroup.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Holdings\n\nSection 721 of the New York Business Corporation Law, or the\nBCL, provides that, in addition to the indemnification provided\nin Article 7\nof the BCL, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer by\na provision contained in its certificate of incorporation or by-\nlaws or by a duly authorized resolution of its shareholders or\ndirectors or by\nagreement provided that no indemnification may be made to or on\nbehalf of any director or officer if a judgment or other final\nadjudication adverse to the director or officer establishes that\nhis acts were committed in bad faith or were the result\nof active and deliberate dishonesty and material to the cause of\naction, or that such director or officer personally gained in\nfact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not\nlegally entitled.\n\nSection 722(a) of the BCL provides that a corporation may\nindemnify a director or officer made, or threatened to be made,\na party to any\naction other than a derivative action, whether civil or\ncriminal, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement\nand reasonable expenses actually and necessarily incurred as a\nresult of such action, if such director or officer acted, in\ngood\nfaith, for a purpose which he reasonably believed to be in, or\nnot opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in\ncriminal actions or proceedings, in addition, has no reasonable\ncause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.\n\nSection 722(c) of the BCL provides that a corporation may\nindemnify a director or officer, made or threatened to be made a\nparty in a\nderivative action, against amounts paid in settlement and\nreasonable expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him in\nconnection with the defense or settlement of such action or in\nconnection with an appeal therein if such director or officer\nacted, in good faith, for a purpose which he reasonably believed\nto be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the\ncorporation, except that no indemnification will be available\nunder Section 722(c) of the BCL in respect of a threatened or\npending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of or any\nclaims as to which such director or officer shall have been\nadjudged liable to the corporation, unless and only to the\nextent that the court in which the action was brought, or, if no\naction was brought, any court of competent jurisdiction,\ndetermines, upon application, that, in view of all the\ncircumstances of the case, the director or officer is fairly and\nreasonably entitled to indemnity for such portion of the\nsettlement\namount and expenses as the court deems proper.\n\nSection 723 of the BCL specifies the manner in which payment of\nindemnification under\nSection 722 of the BCL or indemnification permitted under\nSection 721 of the BCL may be authorized by the corporation.
