In contrast, 2020 was something altogether different:\na year of extreme challenges, resilient financial performance,\nand change. In terms of challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic first\nhit with full force in March, with severe financial market\ndisruption, a sharp plunge in our share price, and interest\nrates nosediving to near zero across the yield curve. As the\nworld moved into varying stages of lockdown, approximately three\nquarters of Citi\u2019s global workforce \u2013 about 200,000 people \u2013\ntransitioned to work from home. Fueled by soaring unemployment\nand the prospect of widespread insolvencies, the dark\nmacroeconomic outlook contributed to a near-doubling of the\ncompany\u2019s loan loss reserve \u2013 and a correspondingly sharp\ndecline in profitability. To preserve capital, Citi joined other\nlarge U.S. banks in suspending share repurchases. And, towards\nthe end of the year, the company entered into sweeping consent\norders with U.S. regulators and was assessed a large civil money\npenalty for significant deficiencies in its risk management and\noperating controls. In the face of these challenges, Citi\nemployees stepped up. Operationally, the company was\nexceptionally nimble in making work-from-home really work \u2013\nprioritizing employee safety and health \u2013 while providing strong\nsupport to clients throughout our global footprint. Financially,\nCiti demonstrated the resilience of its post-financial crisis\noperating model: a client-centric, stronger, and less risky bank\nwith a diversified earnings stream. The headwinds of lower\ninterest rates and challenged credit card performance driven by\nimpacted consumers were offset by the robust performance of the\nmarkets and institutional banking businesses. Total revenues for\nthe year equaled those of the previous year. The company was\nprofitable in every quarter, and the levels of its capital and\nliquidity remained strong throughout. Yearly earnings were $11\nbillion, with the decline from the previous year roughly equal\nto the year\u2019s sharp increase in the loan loss reserve \u2013 a\nreserve that will be directly affected by the extent to which\nthe economy recovers from the pandemic. And by the end of 2020,\nCiti\u2019s share price had substantially recovered from its March\ndecline. This resilient performance during the pandemic was in\nlarge measure the fruit of the multi-year strategy designed and\nexecuted under the strong leadership of our recently retired\nCEO, Mike Corbat. After the financial crisis, Mike worked\ntirelessly to change Citi into, in his words, a \u201csimpler, safer,\nand stronger\u201d banking organization. The company\u2019s performance\nduring the real-world stress test of COVID-19 plainly\ndemonstrated the wisdom of that strategy. This is the heart of\nMike\u2019s legacy, along with his outspoken leadership in making\nCiti an industry leader on diversity, pay equity,\nsustainability, and community reinvestment. For all of this, the\nBoard is deeply grateful \u2013 as we are for his 38 years of\ndedicated service to Citi. This leads to the last theme of 2020,\nwhich is change. In this spirit, we welcome Citi\u2019s new CEO, Jane\nFraser, whom the Board believes is ideally suited to lead Citi\nas it emerges from the pandemic. Jane thoroughly understands the\ncompany from her proven track record over 16 years of running\ndifferent operations, including the Private Bank, U.S. Consumer\nand Commercial Banking, our Latin American region, and the\nGlobal Consumer Bank. She also brings to the role a keen\nunderstanding of corporate strategy both from her work at Citi\nand in prior positions. The Board has focused on a smooth\ntransition for Jane as she takes the reins, and we believe that\nhas put her in an excellent position to address the challenges\nfacing the company.\n\n\u201c Financially, Citi\ndemonstrated the\nresilience of its\npost-financial crisis\noperating model:\na client-centric,\nstronger, and less\nrisky bank\u2026 \u201d Citi 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n     \n  5  \n     \n                                                                \n                First among                                     \n                these, as the                                   \n                consent                                         \n                orders                                          \n                described                                       \n                above made                                      \n                painfully                                       \n                clear, is the                                   \n                need to                                         \n                fundamentally                                   \n                change the                                      \n                company\u2019s                                       \n                risk and                                        \n                control                                         \n                environment.                                    \n                The Board                                       \n                believes that                                   \n                this change                                     \n                is absolutely                                   \n                critical: not                                   \n                just to                                         \n                remediate                                       \n                deficiencies                                    \n                identified by                                   \n                regulators,                                     \n                but to build                                    \n                and deeply                                      \n                invest in the                                   \n                technological                                   \n                and operating                                   \n                backbone that                                   \n                Citi will                                       \n                sorely                                          \n                need to                                         \n                compete                                         \n                effectively                                     \n                in its much                                     \n                more digital                                    \n                future.                                         \n                Indeed, this                                    \n                Transformati\u2026                                   \n                \u2013 as                                            \n                it has                                          \n                rightfully                                      \n                been dubbed \u2013                                   \n                is the                                          \n                predicate for                                   \n                Citi\u2019s                                          \n                long-term                                       \n                strategic                                       \n                success;

The following\nsupplements that discussion by highlighting compensation-related\ndevelopments at Citi during 2020. In October 2020, we entered\ninto Consent Orders with the Federal Reserve Board and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that focused on\nour risk and control practices (Consent Orders). Consistent with\nour performance-based approach to compensation decisions, in\ndetermining executive incentive compensation awards for 2020,\nthe Compensation Committee reduced named executive officer\nincentive compensation awards based on assessments of individual\nperformance concerning management of risk and control. In\naddition, named executive officer incentive compensation awards\nwere further reduced to reflect shared responsibility for\nconcerns about management of risk and control underlying the\nConsent Orders. The following additional developments affected\nour compensation programs in 2020:\n                                                      \n  In 2019, we implemented a new performance           \n  management methodology for our Executive            \n  Management Team. In 2020, we cascaded the           \n  principles of our methodology to about 400          \n  additional employees who have the ability to        \n  expose us to material amounts of risk and created   \n  the Compensation Accountability Rationale Tool      \n  (CART) to administer those principles. CART         \n  focuses the evaluation process on four pillars:     \n  Risk and Control; Financial; Client and Franchise;  \n  and Leadership. We also added new risk and control  \n  scorecard metrics and content related to specific   \n  regulatory remediation programs to CART.            \n                                                      \n                                                     \n  During 2020, we did not make any special one-time  \n  compensation awards to any executive officers,     \n  including retention or separation awards. We also  \n  did not adjust outstanding awards to reflect the   \n  impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n                                                     \n                                                      \n  Beginning with a report in 2020, our Chief          \n  Compliance Officer joined our Chief Risk Officer    \n  in making semi-annual reports to the Compensation   \n  Committee concerning compliance-related issues and  \n  our compensation practices.                         \n                                                      \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  COMPENSATION                             17  \n  AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS      \n                                               \n                                                      \n  For 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted        \n  different weightings for Chief Financial Officer    \n  and Chief Risk Officer goals, consistent with       \n  their critical roles in providing for safety and    \n  soundness. Prior to 2019, financial goals were      \n  weighted 70% and non-financial goals were weighted  \n  30% in each executive officer\u2019s performance         \n  evaluation. In 2020, this weighting methodology     \n  for determining incentive awards was eliminated     \n  for all executive officers. Instead, performance    \n  against goals in each CART pillar resulted in       \n  positive or negative adjustments calculated as a    \n  percentage of target total compensation. The        \n  elimination of the weighting methodology and the    \n  introduction of adjustments calculated as a         \n  percentage of target total compensation was         \n  intended to emphasize performance in the Risk and   \n  Control pillar. The range of adjustments varies     \n  for each pillar based on the responsibilities of    \n  each executive officer\u2019s position, in a manner      \n  that correlates to our risk and control-based line  \n  of defense classifications. Financial metrics were  \n  not used in the calculation of incentive awards     \n  for our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance        \n  Officer or Chief Auditor, to strengthen the         \n  incentives for those function heads to focus on     \n  managing risk and control.                          \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  For 2020, the Audit Committee of our Board of       \n  Directors working together with our Internal Audit  \n  function provided a qualitative assessment to the   \n  Compensation Committee related to the risk and      \n  control behavior of our Executive Management Team   \n  and a quantitative assessment based on specific     \n  metrics. Similarly, Executive Management Team       \n  members received an enhanced review of their        \n  quantitative and qualitative anti-money laundering  \n  (AML) metrics and behaviors. These changes were     \n  also in line with regulatory guidance.              \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  All of our employees have a shared responsibility   \n  to hold themselves to the highest standards of      \n  ethics and professional behavior, acting with       \n  integrity in everything they do, making the right   \n  decisions, and holding each other accountable for   \n  their actions as individuals, as team members, and  \n  as an organization. In 2019, we established, and    \n  in 2020 we enhanced, an Accountability Framework    \n  that prescribes consistent employee treatment and   \n  consequences in response to misconduct and risk     \n  management performance concerns to be applied       \n  within the context of the year-end performance and  \n  compensation process. If an employee is subject to  \n  discipline, breaches risk limit thresholds or       \n  fails to address identified control issues in a     \n  timely manner, that conduct is required by the      \n  Accountability Framework to be taken into           \n  consideration during the annual performance and     \n  compensation review.                                \n

The 2020 Annual Report is also available on Citi\u0092s\nwebsite at www.citigroup.com. We urge you to read these\ndocuments carefully. In accordance with the SEC\u0092s rules, the\nFive-Year Performance Graph appears in the 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, which is included in Citi\u0092s Annual Report to\nStockholders for 2020. Corporate Governance Guidelines Citi\u0092s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines (the Guidelines) embody many of\nour long-standing practices, policies, and procedures, which are\nthe foundation of our commitment to best practices. The\nGuidelines are reviewed at least annually, and revised as\nnecessary, to continue to reflect best practices. The full text\nof the Guidelines, as approved by the Board, is set forth on\nCiti\u0092s website at www.citigroup.com. Click on \u0093About Us,\u0094 then\n\u0093Corporate Governance,\u0094 and then \u0093Corporate Governance\nGuidelines.\u0094 The Guidelines outline the responsibilities,\noperations, qualifications, and composition of the Board. The\nfollowing summarizes certain provisions of the Guidelines.\nDirector Independence Our goal is that at least two-thirds of\nthe members of the Board be independent. Descriptions of our\nindependence criteria and the results of the Board\u0092s\nindependence determinations are set forth below. Board\nCommittees The Guidelines require that all members of the\nfollowing committees of the Board: Audit; Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs; and Personnel and Compensation be\nindependent. Committee members are appointed by the Board upon\nthe recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee. Committee membership and Chairs are rotated\nperiodically. The Board and each Committee have the power to\nhire and fire independent legal, financial, or other advisors,\nas they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the\napproval of management. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  22  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nAdditional Board Service The number of other for-profit public\nor non-public company boards on which a Director may serve shall\nbe subject to review and approval by the Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs Committee, in order to ensure that each\nDirector is able to devote sufficient time to perform his or her\nduties as a Director. Change in Status or Responsibilities If a\nDirector has a substantial change in professional\nresponsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she\nis required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee and to offer his or her resignation from the\nBoard. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nwill evaluate the facts and circumstances and make a\nrecommendation to the Board whether to accept the resignation or\nrequest that the Director continue to serve on the Board. If a\nDirector assumes a significant role in a not-for-profit entity,\nhe or she is asked to notify the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee. Attendance at Meetings Directors are\nexpected to attend Board meetings and meetings of the Committees\non which they serve and the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All\nof the Directors then in office attended Citi\u0092s 2020 Virtual\nAnnual Meeting. Evaluation of Board Performance The Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee conducts an annual\nreview of Board performance in which the full Board\nparticipates, and each standing committee (except for the\nExecutive Committee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part\nof the self-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of\nits own performance of its obligations with regard to such\nmatters as regulatory requirements, strategic and financial\noversight, oversight of risk management, executive compensation,\nsuccession planning, and governance, among many other topics.\nThe committees evaluate their performance against the\nrequirements of their charters and other aspects of their\nresponsibilities. The full Board and each committee then discuss\nthe results of their respective self-evaluations in executive\nsession, highlighting actions to be taken in response to the\ndiscussion. See Board Self-Assessment Process on page 29 for\nfurther information. Directors Access to Senior Management and\nDirector Orientation Directors have full and free access to\nsenior management and other employees of Citi. New Directors are\nprovided with an orientation program to familiarize them with\nCiti\u0092s businesses, regions, and functions as well as its legal,\ncompliance, regulatory, and risk profile. Citi provides\neducational sessions on a variety of topics throughout the year\nfor all members of the Board. These sessions are designed to\nallow Directors to, for example, develop a deeper understanding\nof a business issue or a complex financial product. Succession\nPlanning The Board reviews the Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee\u0092s report on the performance of senior executives in\norder to ensure that they are providing the highest quality\nleadership for Citi. The Board also works with the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee to evaluate potential\nsuccessors to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). With respect to\nregular succession of the CEO and senior management, Citi\u0092s\nBoard evaluates internal, and, when appropriate, external\ncandidates. To find external candidates, Citi seeks input from\nthe members of the Board, senior management, and from recruiting\nfirms. To develop internal candidates, Citi engages in a number\nof practices, formal and informal, designed to familiarize the\nBoard with Citi\u0092s talent pool. The formal process involves an\nannual talent review conducted by senior management at which the\nBoard studies the most promising members of senior management.\nThe Board learns about each person\u0092s experience, skills, areas\nof expertise, Citi 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                            \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  23  \n                            \naccomplishments, and goals. This review is conducted at a\nregularly scheduled Board meeting on an annual basis. In\naddition, members of senior management are periodically asked to\nmake presentations to the Board at Board meetings and Board\nstrategy sessions. These presentations are made by senior\nmanagers of the various business units as well as those who\nserve in corporate functions. The purpose of the formal review\nand other interaction is to ensure that Board members are\nfamiliar with the talent pool inside and outside Citi from which\nthe Board would be able to choose successors to the CEO and\nevaluate succession for other senior managers as necessary from\ntime to time. Charitable Contributions If a Director, or an\nimmediate family member who shares the Director\u0092s household,\nserves as a director, trustee, or executive officer of a\nfoundation, university, or other not-for-profit organization,\nand such entity receives contributions from Citi and/or the Citi\nFoundation, such contributions must be reported to the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least\nannually. Insider Investments and Transactions Members of Citi\u0092s\nBoard of Directors and Citi\u0092s executive officers (i.e., Section\n16 Insiders) are not permitted to hedge their Citi securities or\nto pledge their Citi securities as collateral for a loan. The\nGuidelines restrict certain financial transactions between Citi\nand its subsidiaries on the one hand and Directors, senior\nmanagement, and their immediate family members on the other.\nPersonal loans from Citi or its subsidiaries to Citi\u0092s Directors\nand its most senior executives, or immediate family members who\nshare any such person\u0092s household, are prohibited, except for\nmargin loans to employees of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi,\nmortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans, credit cards,\nand overdraft checking privileges, all made on market terms in\nthe ordinary course of business. See Certain Transactions and\nRelationships, Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider\nParticipation on pages 37-39 of this Proxy Statement. The\nGuidelines prohibit investments or transactions by Citi or its\nexecutive officers and those immediate family members who share\nan executive officer\u0092s household in a partnership or other\nprivately held entity in which an outside Director is a\nprincipal, or in a publicly traded company in which an outside\nDirector owns or controls more than a 10% interest. Directors\nand those immediate family members who share the Director\u0092s\nhousehold are not permitted to receive initial public offering\nallocations. Directors and their immediate family members may\nparticipate in Citi-sponsored investment activities, provided\nthey are offered on the same terms as those offered to similarly\nsituated non-affiliated persons. Under certain circumstances, or\nwith the approval of the appropriate committee, members of\nsenior management may participate in certain Citi-sponsored\ninvestment opportunities. Finally, there is a prohibition on\ncertain investments by Directors and executive officers in\nthird-party entities when the opportunity comes solely as a\nresult of their position with Citi. Director Independence The\nBoard has adopted categorical standards to assist the Board in\nevaluating the independence of each of its Directors. The\ncategorical standards, which are set forth below, describe\nvarious types of relationships that could potentially exist\nbetween a Director or an immediate family member of a Director\nand Citi, and set thresholds at which such relationships would\nbe deemed to be material. Provided that no relationship or\ntransaction exists that would disqualify a Director under the\ncategorical standards and no other relationships or transactions\nexist of a type not specifically mentioned in the categorical\nstandards that, in the Board\u0092s opinion, taking into account all\nfacts and circumstances, would impair a Director\u0092s ability to\nexercise his or her independent judgment, the Board will deem\nsuch person to be independent. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n                            \n  24  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nThe Board and the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee reviewed certain information obtained from Directors\u2019\nresponses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships\nwith Citi, and those of their immediate family members and\nprimary business or charitable affiliations and other potential\nconflicts of interest, as well as certain data collected by\nCiti\u2019s businesses related to transactions, relationships, or\narrangements between Citi on the one hand and a Director,\nimmediate family member of a Director, or a primary business or\ncharitable affiliation of a Director, on the other.

During 2020, Mr. Dugan presided at\neach executive session of the non-management Directors. In\naddition, the independent Directors met in executive session\nduring 2020. Board Leadership Structure Citi currently has an\nindependent Chair separate from the CEO, a structure that has\nbeen in place since 2009. The Board believes it is important to\nmaintain flexibility in its Board leadership structure and has\nhad in place different leadership structures in the past,\ndepending on the Company\u0092s needs at the time, but firmly\nsupports having an independent Director in a Board leadership\nposition at all times. Accordingly, Citi\u0092s Board, on December\n15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if Citi\ndoes not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect a lead\nindependent Director having similar duties to an independent\nChair, including leading the executive sessions of the non-\nmanagement Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u0092s Chair provides\nindependent leadership of the Board. Having an independent Chair\nor Lead Director enables non-management Directors to raise\nissues and concerns for Board consideration without immediately\ninvolving management. The Chair or Lead Director also serves as\na liaison between the Board and senior management. Citi\u0092s Board\nhas determined that the current structure, an independent Chair\nseparate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this\ntime, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be an\nindependent Director in a Board leadership position. The Board\nbelieves its approach to risk oversight, including, importantly,\nhaving a standing Risk Management Committee and the reporting\nline of the Chief Risk Officer to the Risk Management Committee,\nensures that the Board can choose many leadership structures\nwithout experiencing a material impact on its oversight of risk.\n                                                 \n  Citi has had an independent Chair since 2009.  \n                                                 \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  28  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nBoard Diversity Diversity is among the critical factors that the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers\nwhen evaluating the composition of the Board. For a company like\nCiti, which operates in more than 100 countries around the\nglobe, diversity includes race, ethnicity, nationality, and\ngender as well as the diversity of the communities and\ngeographies in which Citi operates. Included in the\nqualifications for Directors listed in the Company\u0092s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines is \u0093whether the candidate has special\nskills, expertise and background that would complement the\nattributes of the existing Directors, taking into consideration\nthe diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\u0094\nCiti\u0092s Board is committed to ensuring that it is composed of\nindividuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented\nby our employees, customers, and stakeholders. When considering\nnew Director candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include\ndiverse candidates in each slate. The candidates nominated for\nelection at Citi\u0092s 2021 Annual Meeting exemplify that diversity:\neight nominees are women and three nominees are Black or Latino.\nIn addition, each Director candidate contributes to the Board\u0092s\noverall diversity by providing a variety of perspectives,\npersonal and professional experiences, and backgrounds, as well\nas other characteristics, such as global and international\nbusiness experience. The Board believes that the current\nnominees reflect an appropriate diversity of gender, age, race,\nnational origin, geographical background, and experience and is\ncommitted to continuing to consider diversity in evaluating the\ncomposition of the Board. Director Education Program Citi has a\nrobust Director Education Program that begins with an\norientation for newly appointed Directors, providing two days of\nin-depth training covering all aspects of our business,\nincluding, among other things, coverage of Citi\u0092s institutional\nand consumer businesses; our regional operations, an overview of\nthe Company\u0092s risk management, audit, compliance, operations and\ntechnology, governance, regulatory, finance, human resources,\ngovernment affairs, and legal functions; and an overview of\nCiti\u0092s primary banking subsidiary, Citibank, N.A. There is also\na continuing education program, which includes presentations\nfocusing on industry, regulatory and governance topics and\npresentations from the various lines of our business on emerging\nissues or strategic initiatives to provide our Directors with\nthe opportunity to expand their insight into Citi\u0092s business\noperations and activities. Directors also have access to\nexternal programming and seminars to supplement their Citi-\nprovided education. In 2020, the Directors received training on\nvarious topics, including certain complex business products,\nCybersecurity, Code of Conduct, Straight-Through Processing,\nRegulation O, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending, and AML,\namong other topics.

Specifically, the activities that\nCiti engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must\nbe consistent with Citi\u2019s mission and value proposition, the key\nprinciples that guide it and Citi\u2019s risk appetite. The Citigroup\nBoard of Directors, both directly or through its committees,\nactively oversees Citi\u2019s risk taking activities and holds\nmanagement accountable for adhering to the Company-wide risk\ngovernance framework. The Board of Directors recently formed the\nTransformation Oversight Committee to oversee management\u2019s\nefforts to improve our Risk and Control environment, and oversee\nthe FRB Order, as well as to monitor management\u2019s progress as it\nrelates to the broader transformation of Citi. (Please see page\n31 of this Proxy Statement to review additional disclosure on\nthe Transformation Oversight Committee.) Citi\u2019s risk governance\nframework consists of the risk management practices that include\na risk governance structure and the firm\u2019s key policies,\nprocesses, personnel and control systems through which Citi\nidentifies, measures, monitors, and controls risks such that the\nCompany\u2019s risk taking is consistent with its strategy and risk\nappetite. It also emphasizes Citi\u2019s risk culture and lays out\nstandards, procedures and programs that are designed to set,\nreinforce and enhance the Company\u2019s risk culture, integrate its\nvalues and conduct expectations into the organization, providing\nemployees with tools to assist them with making prudent and\nethical risk decisions and to escalate issues appropriately.\nCiti uses a lines of defense construct to manage its risks. The\nconstruct includes units that create risks (first line of\ndefense), those that independently assess risk (second line of\ndefense), units that provide independent assurance (third line\nof defense) and units tasked with maintaining a strong control\nenvironment (control and support functions). The lines of\ndefense, which include control and support functions, coordinate\nwith each other in the risk management system in support of the\ncommon goal of identifying, measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling risk-taking activities so they remain consistent\nwith the firm\u2019s strategy and risk appetite.

Citi believes the\nTransformation is essential, not only to address regulatory\nmatters in an effective, timely, and sustainable manner, but\nalso as a broader strategic imperative for the firm. Citi\u0092s\npriorities revolve around three interconnected elements: the\nTransformation, strategy, and culture and talent. Driving toward\nexcellence in risk and control in the Transformation is mutually\nreinforcing with Citi\u0092s business strategy, and success for both\ncan only be achieved with significant shifts in culture and\ntalent. In connection with the Transformation, the Board has\nchanged its committee structure and the roles and\nresponsibilities that each committee fulfills. First, the Board\nestablished the Transformation Oversight Committee in October\n2020, to serve as the primary forum for Board oversight of the\nTransformation. The Board decided to unify the oversight of the\nTransformation through the Transformation Oversight Committee.\nGiven this overall responsibility of the Transformation\nOversight Committee and the need for holistic oversight, the\nBoard decided to invite all non-management directors on the\nBoard to join the committee to ensure full Board attention to\nthe Transformation oversight. The full Board will focus in its\nother meetings on non-Transformation matters. Similarly, the\nBoard restructured and reduced the workload of its committees\nother than the Transformation Oversight Committee to enable them\nto focus their meeting time on matters unrelated to the\nTransformation. A series of Program Groups have been developed\nto address specific requirements of the Consent Order. These\nProgram Groups have been tasked with performing gap assessments\nagainst a desired target state and developing implementation\nplans to remediate those gaps. Members of the Transformation\nOversight Committee will be responsible for working closely with\nthe Executive Management Team members responsible for the\nrelevant Program Groups to better understand the work of the\nProgram Groups and to help prepare for meetings of the\nTransformation Oversight Committee, in much the same way as\nBoard Committee chairs interact with individual Executive\nManagement Team members in preparation for committee meetings.\nBoard\u0092s Role in Cybersecurity Oversight The Board of Directors\nprovides oversight of management\u0092s efforts to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board\nreceives regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the year with management and subject-\nmatter experts on the effectiveness of Citi\u0092s overall\ncybersecurity program, Citi\u0092s inherent cybersecurity risks, the\nroad map for addressing these risks, and Citi\u0092s progress in\ndoing so. Board and Committee members receive contemporaneous\nreporting on significant cyber events including response, legal\nobligations, and outreach and notification to regulators, and\ncustomers when needed, as well as guidance to management as\nappropriate. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  32  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nCommittees of the Board of Directors Below are the standing\ncommittees of the Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of\nDirectors formed a new ad hoc committee, the Transformation\nOversight Committee, to oversee management\u0092s efforts to enhance\nits Risk and Control environment and achieve operational\nexcellence.

any\naffiliate thereof, is a party adverse to Citi or in which any\nsuch person has a material interest adverse to Citi. In lieu of\nparticipating in certain class action settlements entered into\nby Citi and other banks relating to alleged manipulation of the\nforeign exchange market, which received final court approval in\n2018, numerous BlackRock funds and other plaintiffs filed a\ncomplaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York on November 7, 2018 against Citi and 15 other banks. In\nthis action, plaintiffs assert that defendants conspired to\nmanipulate the foreign exchange market between 2003 and 2013.\nBlackRock, Inc. owns more than 5% of Citi\u0092s common stock.\nCertain Transactions and Relationships, Compensation Committee\nInterlocks, and Insider Participation The Board has adopted a\npolicy setting forth procedures for the review, approval, and\nmonitoring of transactions involving Citi and related persons\n(Directors, Senior Managers, 5% stockholders, Immediate Family\nMember or Primary Business Affiliations). A copy of Citi\u0092s\nPolicy on Related Party Transactions is available on our website\nat www.citigroup.com. Click on \u0093About Us,\u0094 then \u0093Corporate\nGovernance,\u0094 and then \u0093Citi Policies.\u0094 Under the policy, the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving all related party\ntransactions involving related persons. Directors may not\nparticipate in any discussion or approval of a related party\ntransaction in which he or she or any member of his or her\nimmediate family is a related person, except that the Director\nmust provide all material information concerning the related\nparty transaction to the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee is also responsible for reviewing and approving all\nrelated party transactions valued at more than $50 million\ninvolving an executive officer or an Immediate Family Member of\nan executive officer.

Indebtedness Other than\ncertain \u201cgrandfathered\u201d margin loans, in accordance with\nSarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate Governance Guidelines, no\nmargin loans may be made to any executive officer unless such\nperson is an employee of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi and\nsuch loan is made in the ordinary course of business. Certain\ntransactions in excess of $120,000 involving loans, deposits,\ncredit cards, and sales of commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, and other money market instruments and certain other\nbanking transactions occurred during 2018 between Citibank, N.A.\nand other Citi banking subsidiaries on the one hand, and certain\nDirectors or executive officers of Citi, members of their\nimmediate families, corporations or organizations of which any\nof them is an executive officer or partner or of which any of\nthem is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of\nsecurities, or associates of the Directors, the executive\nofficers or their family members, on the other. The transactions\nwere made in the ordinary course of business on substantially\nthe same terms, including interest rates and collateral, that\nprevailed at the time for comparable transactions with other\npersons not related to the lender and did not involve more than\nthe normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable\nfeatures. Personal loans made to any Director or an executive\nofficer must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation O, and the\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, and must be made in the\nordinary course of business. Citi\u2019s Hedging Policies Citi\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines prohibit the hedging of Citi\ncommon stock held by directors and executive officers, whether\nthe shares of stock are granted as compensation or are otherwise\nheld by the director or executive officer. For this purpose, an\nexecutive officer means any person designated by Citi as an\n\u201cofficer\u201d under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Citi\u2019s Code of\nConduct, which applies to all Citi employees, executive officers\nand directors, states that when considering personal investments\nin Citi securities, an individual must avoid any personal trade\nor investment in a security, derivative, futures contract,\ncommodity, or other financial instrument if the trade or\ninvestment might affect or appear to affect the individual\u2019s\nability to make unbiased business decisions for Citi.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  40  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Personal Trading and Investment Policy (the\nPTIP) prohibits the hedging in any manner (other than currency\nhedges) by Covered Persons (including directors and executive\nofficers) of unvested restricted stock or deferred stock awarded\nas compensation under Citi\u2019s Capital Accumulation Program. The\nPTIP also prohibits engaging in speculative transactions in Citi\nsecurities, including sales of naked calls and speculative\noption strategies, as well as any other transaction that would\nbenefit from a decline in the value of a Citi security. The PTIP\ngenerally allows Covered Persons (excluding directors and\nexecutive officers) to hedge vested long positions of then\ndeliverable Citi securities. Covered Persons under the PTIP\ninclude (but are not limited to) individuals who 1) may have\naccess to material non-public information regarding Citi, 2) are\nemployed by Citi\u2019s Institutional Clients Group, 3) are FINRA-\nregistered employees or associates of any of Citi\u2019s U.S. broker\ndealer entities, or 4) work in a securities or advisory business\nin Citi Personal Wealth Management, as well as certain\nindividuals who are related to Covered Persons. Because\ndirectors and executive officers who are Covered Persons under\nthe PTIP are also subject to the hedging policy applicable to\ndirectors and executive officers pursuant to the Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, a proposed transaction by a director or\nexecutive officer may be prohibited by application of one policy\neven if the transaction would be permissible under the other\npolicy. Finally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K. and\nEuropean regulatory requirements. These policies provide that\nall employees in the applicable countries who receive a portion\nof their remuneration in stock or any other deferral mechanism\ndesignated by Citi must not take out insurance contracts or\nengage in personal hedging strategies, or remuneration or\nliability-related contracts of insurance, that undermine, or may\nundermine, any risk alignment effects of their remuneration\narrangements. Reputation Risk Committees The Reputation Risk\nCommittees, which are internal management committees, are part\nof the governance infrastructure that Citi has in place to\nreview the reputation risk posed by business activities, sales\npractices, product design, or perceived conflicts of interest.\nThese committees may also raise potential reputation risks for\ndue consideration by the Reputation Risk Committee at the\ncorporate level. The Group Reputation Risk Committee may\nescalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee of the Board or another appropriate\nCommittee of the Board. The Reputation Risk Committees, which\nare composed of Citi\u2019s most senior executives, govern the\nprocess by which material reputation risks are identified,\nmonitored, reported, managed, and escalated, and appropriate\nactions are taken in line with the firm-wide strategic\nobjectives, risk appetite thresholds, and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting the culture of risk awareness and\nhigh standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the\ncompany, consistent with Citi\u2019s Mission and Value Proposition.\nEthics, Conduct and Culture At Citi, our mission is to serve as\na trusted partner to our clients by responsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable growth and economic progress. We\nfoster a culture of ethics through our governance framework,\nprograms and efforts that embed our culture and expectations for\nbehavior throughout the organization, and collaboration with key\nstakeholders outside Citi to improve Citi\u2019s and the banking\nindustry\u2019s culture. Governance over Culture The cornerstone of\nour approach to culture is our governance framework, which\nbegins with a strong \u201ctone from the top\u201d starting with the\nCitigroup Board of Directors.

Delinquent Section\n16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 requires the Company\u2019s officers and directors, and persons\nwho own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company\u2019s\nequity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in\nownership with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5.

Other than Mr. Corbat, the Board has nominated all of the\ncurrent Directors for re-election at the 2021 Annual Meeting.\nDirectors are not eligible to stand for re-election after\nreaching the age of 72. Ms. Fraser was elected by the Board in\nOctober 2020. Ms. Fraser was recommended as a candidate for\nelection to Citi\u2019s Board by members of the Board. If elected,\neach nominee will hold office until the 2022 Annual Meeting or\nuntil his or her successor is elected and qualified. Director\nCriteria and Nomination Process The Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee considers all qualified candidates\nidentified by members of the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee, by other members of the Board, by senior\nmanagement, and by security holders. During 2020, the Committee\nengaged Egon Zehnder to assist in identifying and evaluating\npotential nominees. Stockholders who would like to propose a\nDirector candidate for consideration by the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee may do so by submitting\nthe candidate\u2019s name, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and biographical information to\nthe attention of the Corporate Secretary, Citigroup Inc., 388\nGreenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. All proposals for\nnominations received by the Corporate Secretary will be\npresented to the Committee for its consideration. In considering\nthe composition of the Board of Directors, the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee inventories the\ncategories of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business mix,\nand geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates with\nthe skills and experience necessary to enable the Board of\nDirectors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also takes\nDirector tenure into consideration when making Director\nnomination decisions and believes that it is desirable to\nmaintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced Directors and\nnewer Directors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board also\nbelieve that longer-tenured, experienced Directors are a\nsignificant strength of the Board, given the large size of our\nCompany, the breadth of our product offerings, and the\ninternational scope of our organization. When nominating new\ndirector candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include\ndiverse candidates in each slate. The Board\u2019s composition, and\nthe individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are\nthe result of careful consideration by the Committee of the\ncorrespondence between the risk inventory and skills and\nexperience of the Board members and candidates. In addition to\nthe ability to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular\nrisk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee\u2019s\nbiography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a\nvariety of factors, including the following criteria, which have\nbeen developed by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee and approved by the Board:\n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that          \n  \u25cf  indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical    \n     standards;                                                 \n     Whether the candidate has had business, governmental,      \n     non-profit or professional experience at the chair, chief  \n     executive officer, chief operating officer, or equivalent  \n     policy-making and operational level of a large             \n     organization with significant international activities     \n  \u25cf  across many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that      \n     indicates that the candidate will be able to make a        \n     meaningful and immediate contribution to the Board\u2019s       \n     discussion of and decision-making on the array of complex  \n     issues facing a large financial services business that     \n     operates on a global scale;                                \n     Whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and a  \n     diverse background that would complement the attributes    \n  \u25cf  of the existing Directors, taking into consideration the   \n     diverse communities and geographies in which the Company   \n     operates;                                                  \n     Whether the candidate has the financial expertise          \n  \u25cf  required to provide effective oversight of a diversified   \n     financial services business that operates on a global      \n     scale;                                                     \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                         \n  46  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has achieved prominence in his or    \n     her business, governmental, or professional activities     \n  \u25cf  and has built a reputation that demonstrates the ability   \n     to make the kind of important and sensitive judgments      \n     that the Board is called upon to make;                     \n     Whether the candidate will effectively, consistently, and  \n     appropriately take into account and balance the            \n  \u25cf  legitimate interests and concerns of all of the Company\u2019s  \n     stockholders and other stakeholders in reaching            \n     decisions, rather than advancing the interests of a        \n     particular constituency;                                   \n     Whether the candidate possesses a willingness to           \n  \u25cf  challenge management while working constructively as part  \n     of a team in an environment of collegiality and trust;     \n     and                                                        \n     Whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient    \n  \u25cf  time and energy to the performance of his or her duties    \n     as a Director.                                             \n                                                                \nApplication of these factors involves the exercise of judgment\nby the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and\nthe Board. In addition, see Board Diversity on page 28 for\nadditional factors considered by the Board when selecting\ncandidates. Based on its assessment of each candidate\u2019s\nindependence, skills and qualifications and the criteria\ndescribed above, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee will make recommendations regarding potential Director\ncandidates to the Board. The Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee follows the same process and uses the same\ncriteria for evaluating candidates proposed by stockholders,\nmembers of the Board of Directors, and members of senior\nmanagement. For the 2021 Annual Meeting, we received notice from\none stockholder who proposed himself for consideration to be\nnominated by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee to stand for election at the Annual Meeting. The\nqualifications of the individual were discussed at a meeting of\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the\nviews of Egon Zehnder were considered. After deliberation, the\nCommittee decided not to include this individual on the slate of\ncandidates it proposed to the full Board for consideration. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee used the\nabove-mentioned criteria to evaluate the candidate. Director\nQualifications The nominees for the Board of Directors each have\nthe qualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi\u2019s\nstrategy and to oversee management\u2019s execution of that strategic\nvision. Citi\u2019s Board of Directors consists of individuals with\nthe skills, experience, and diverse backgrounds necessary to\noversee Citi\u2019s efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller,\nsafer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk\nand operating within a complex financial and regulatory\nenvironment. The nominees listed below are leaders in business,\nthe financial community, and academia because of their\nintellectual acumen and analytic skills, strategic vision,\nability to lead and inspire others to work with them, and\nrecords of outstanding accomplishments over a period of decades.\nEach has been chosen to stand for election in part because of\nhis or her ability and willingness to ask difficult questions,\nunderstand Citi\u2019s unique challenges, and evaluate the strategies\nproposed by management, as well as their implementation. Each of\nthe nominees has a long record of professional integrity, a\ndedication to his or her profession and community, a strong work\nethic that includes a commitment to coming fully prepared to\nmeetings and being willing to spend the time and effort needed\nto fulfill professional obligations and the ability to maintain\na collegial environment. Many of our nominees are either current\nor former chief executive officers or chairs of other large\ninternational corporations or have experience operating large,\ncomplex academic or governmental departments. As such, they have\na deep understanding of, and extensive experience in, many of\nthe areas that are outlined below as being of critical\nimportance to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success. For the\npurposes of its analysis, the Board has Citi 2021 Proxy\nStatement Table of Contents\n                                         \n  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  47  \n                                         \ndetermined that nominees who have served as a chief executive\nofficer or a chair of a major corporation or large, complex\ninstitution have extensive experience with financial statement\npreparation, compensation determinations, regulatory compliance\n(if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate\ngovernance, public affairs, and legal matters. In evaluating the\ncomposition of the Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee seeks to find and retain individuals who, in\naddition to having the qualifications set forth in Citi\u0092s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, have the skills, experience and\nabilities necessary to meet Citi\u0092s unique needs as a highly\nregulated financial services company with operations in the\ncorporate and consumer businesses within the United States and\nmore than 100 countries around the globe. The Committee has\ndetermined it is critically important to Citi\u0092s proper operation\nand success that its Board has, in addition to the qualities\ndescribed above, expertise and experience in the following\nareas:\n                                                      \n  Citi\u2019s Personnel and Compensation Committee is      \n  responsible for determining the compensation of     \n  the CEO and approving the compensation of other     \n  executive officers of the Company and the           \n  Executive Management Team. In order to properly     \n  carry out its responsibilities with respect to      \n  compensation, Citi\u2019s Board must include members     \n  who have experience evaluating the structure of     \n  compensation for senior executives. They must       \n  understand the various forms of compensation that   \n  can be utilized, the purpose of each type and how   \n  various elements of compensation can be used to     \n  motivate and reward executives and drive            \n  performance, while not encouraging imprudent        \n  risk-taking or simply having short-term goals.      \n  Citi\u0092s Global Consumer Bank (GCB), a global leader   \n  in banking, credit cards and wealth management, is  \n  a critical growth engine for Citi. With a           \n  strategic focus on the U.S., Mexico and Asia, the   \n  Global Consumer Bank serves more than 110 million   \n  clients in 19 markets. Globally, Citi continued to  \n  introduce industry-leading digital capabilities,    \n  redesign the client experience, and embed its       \n  services in the most popular social and e-commerce  \n  platforms, enabling customers to bank anytime,      \n  anywhere, on their channel of choice. Citi looks    \n  to its Board members with extensive consumer        \n  experience to assist it in evaluating its business  \n  model and strategies for reaching and servicing     \n  its retail customers domestically and around the    \n  world. It is critically important that its Board    \n  include members who have consumer-oriented and      \n  financial services backgrounds.                     \n  Citi aspires to the highest standards of corporate  \n  governance and ethical conduct:                     \n  doing what we say, reporting results with accuracy  \n  and transparency, and maintaining compliance with   \n  the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the    \n  Company\u0092s businesses. The Board is responsible for   \n  shaping corporate governance policies and           \n  practices, including adopting the corporate         \n  governance guidelines applicable to the Company     \n  and monitoring the Company\u0092s compliance with         \n  governance policies and the guidelines. To carry    \n  out these responsibilities, the Board must include  \n  experienced leaders in the area of corporate        \n  governance who must be familiar with governance     \n  issues, the constituencies most interested in       \n  those issues, and the impact that governance        \n  policies have on the functioning of a company.      \n  Citi has a long history as a technology             \n  innovator\u0097Citibank, N.A. was one of the first        \n  banks to offer automatic teller machines for its    \n  customers during the 1970s. As Citi deploys new     \n  technology and platform innovations to gather,      \n  process, analyze, and provide information to        \n  execute transactions and meet the needs of its      \n  clients and customers, Citi must ensure that its    \n  operations are efficient and there is a continuous  \n  focus on enhancing productivity to meet its         \n  operational and strategic goals. The Board must     \n  include members who have knowledge and experience   \n  in technology, including such technology-centric    \n  issues as cybersecurity, data privacy and data      \n  management. Members of the Board must be qualified  \n  to provide oversight of the development and         \n  maintenance of Citi\u0092s technology platforms; Citi\u0092s    \n  compliance with regulatory requirements; Citi\u0092s      \n  operational efficiency and productivity             \n  strategies; the operations and reliability of       \n  Citi\u0092s systems; and the protection of client and     \n  customer data.                                      \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                         \n  48  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                      \n  Citi\u0092s internal controls over financial reporting    \n  are designed to ensure that Citi\u0092s financial         \n  reporting and its financial statements are          \n  prepared in accordance with generally accepted      \n  accounting principles. While the Board and its      \n  committees are not responsible for preparing our    \n  financial statements, they have oversight           \n  responsibility, including the selection of outside  \n  independent auditors, subject to stockholder        \n  ratification, and lead engagement partner. The      \n  Board must include members with direct or           \n  supervisory experience in the preparation of        \n  financial statements, as well as finance, audit,    \n  and accounting expertise.                           \n  Citi employs approximately 200,000 people in        \n  nearly 100 countries. Human capital management is   \n  a critical capability for Citi\u0092s Board given the     \n  strategic importance of maintaining a skilled,      \n  motivated workforce. Citi\u0092s Board must include       \n  Directors who understand key issues related to      \n  human capital including training, diversity,        \n  employee benefits, compensation programs, career    \n  trajectories, and U.S. and global labor issues.     \n  Having Directors with the appropriate expertise to  \n  review our succession strategy and leadership       \n  pipeline for key roles while taking into account    \n  Citi\u0092s long-term corporate strategy is paramount     \n  to managing Citi\u0092s resources\u0097its employees. Citi      \n  seeks out Board members who have had experience     \n  overseeing and managing executive teams and a       \n  sizeable worldwide work force, with an emphasis on  \n  development of human resources.                     \n  Citi provides a wide variety of services to its     \n  corporate clients, including strategic and          \n  financial advisory services, such as mergers,       \n  acquisitions, financial restructurings, loans,      \n  foreign exchange, cash management, underwriting     \n  and distributing equity, and debt and equity        \n  derivative services, markets and securities         \n  services, retail structured products, liquidity     \n  management, treasury and trade solutions and        \n  securities and fund services. With a corporate      \n  business as extensive and complex as Citi\u0092s, it is   \n  crucial that members of the Board have the depth    \n  of understanding and experience necessary to guide  \n  management\u0092s conduct of these lines of business.     \n  As a company with a broad international reach,      \n  Citi\u0092s Board values the perspectives of Directors    \n  with international business or governmental         \n  experience or expertise in global economics.        \n  Citi\u0092s presence in markets outside the United        \n  States is an important competitive advantage for    \n  Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and        \n  foreign businesses and individual clients whose     \n  activities span the globe. Directors with           \n  international business experience can use the       \n  experience that they have developed through their   \n  own business dealings to assist Citi\u0092s Board and     \n  management in understanding and successfully        \n  navigating the business, political, and regulatory  \n  environments in countries in which Citi does or     \n  seeks to do business. Directors with global         \n  economics expertise can help guide Citi management  \n  in understanding the challenges faced by other      \n  markets and in developing its global strategy.      \n                                                      \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                         \n  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  49  \n                                         \n                                                      \n  Citi and its subsidiaries are regulated and         \n  supervised by numerous regulatory agencies, both    \n  domestically and internationally, including in the  \n  U.S. the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the   \n  Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit    \n  Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial       \n  Protection Bureau, and state banking and insurance  \n  departments, as well as international financial     \n  services authorities. Having Directors with         \n  experience interacting with regulators or           \n  operating businesses subject to extensive           \n  regulation is important to furthering Citi\u0092s         \n  continued compliance with its many regulatory       \n  requirements and fostering productive               \n  relationships with its regulators. Given the        \n  critical importance of ethics, conduct and          \n  culture, Citi\u0092s Board must include members with      \n  experience overseeing ethics and compliance and     \n  building an effective, values-based ethics and      \n  compliance program. In addition to the regulatory   \n  supervision described above, Citi is subject to     \n  myriad laws and regulations and is party to legal   \n  actions and regulatory proceedings from time to     \n  time. Citi\u0092s Board has an important oversight        \n  function with respect to compliance with            \n  applicable requirements, monitors the progress of   \n  legal proceedings, and evaluates major              \n  settlements.                                        \n  Risk management is a critical function of a         \n  complex global financial services company and its   \n  proper supervision requires Board members with      \n  sophisticated risk management skills and            \n  experience. Directors provide oversight of the      \n  Company\u0092s risk management framework, including the   \n  significant policies, procedures, and practices     \n  used in managing credit, market, and certain other  \n  risks, including liquidity, capital, and balance    \n  sheet risks, as well as capital market risks, and   \n  review recommendations by management regarding      \n  risk mitigation. Given increased cybersecurity      \n  threats, Citi\u0092s Board must have members who have     \n  sufficient experience to enable them to oversee     \n  management\u0092s efforts to monitor, detect and          \n  prevent cyber threats to Citi. Citi\u0092s Board must     \n  include members with risk expertise to assist Citi  \n  in its efforts to properly identify, measure,       \n  monitor, report, analyze, and control or mitigate   \n  risk.                                               \n  Sustainability is a critical business issue, with   \n  ties to both risk and opportunity. Citi has been    \n  engaged in sustainability for over 20 years and     \n  views sustainability performance and transparency   \n  as an important aspect of stockholder and broader   \n  stakeholder value. Citi communicates its            \n  sustainability and ESG efforts to stockholders,     \n  clients and other stakeholders, including its       \n  achievements in the areas of environmental          \n  sustainability, climate change, community           \n  investment and development, and human rights.       \n  Environmental and social issues have the potential  \n  to impede corporate plans and performance, and      \n  also to generate new business, which is why it is   \n  necessary to have a sustainability-competent        \n  Board. Citi\u0092s Board must include members with        \n  experience in the areas of climate change and       \n  finance, community development, corporate social    \n  responsibility and other ESG issues to help Citi    \n  navigate these complex and quickly evolving issues  \n  and to assist management in evaluating Citi\u0092s ESG    \n  policies and programs.                              \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                         \n  50  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \nThe Nominees The following tables give information \u2014 provided by\nthe nominees \u2014 about their principal occupation, business\nexperience, and other matters.

Directors\u2019\ncompensation is determined by the Board and the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee makes recommendations to\nthe Board based on periodic benchmarking assessments and advice\nreceived from FW Cook, its independent advisor. In making\nrecommendations to the Board, the Committee considers the\ncompetitive positioning of the aggregate and individual\ncomponents of compensation, as well as the mix of pay and\nstructure versus both direct competitors and other comparable\norganizations. The Committee also considers the unique skill set\nrequired to serve on our Board and the intense time commitment\nassociated with preparation for and attendance at meetings of\nthe Board and its committees as well as external commitments,\nsuch as engagement with our stockholders and regulators. Since\nour initial public offering in 1986, Citi has paid outside\nDirectors all or a portion of their compensation in common stock\nto ensure that the Directors have an ownership interest in\ncommon with other stockholders.\n                                                      \n  Annual Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award       \n  Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash       \n  retainer of $75,000 and a deferred stock award      \n  valued at $150,000. The deferred stock award is     \n  generally granted on the same date that annual      \n  incentives are granted to the senior executives.    \n  The deferred stock award generally becomes          \n  distributable on the second anniversary of the      \n  date of the grant, and Directors may elect to       \n  defer receipt of the award beyond that date.

This Fee is in addition   \n  to the Retainer and the Deferred Stock Award        \n  payable to all Directors, as well as any relevant   \n  Committee Chair and/or Committee Fees. The three    \n  elements of compensation for our current Chair,     \n  Mr. Dugan \u2014 the Chair Fee, the Retainer and         \n  Deferred Stock Award, and Committee Fees \u2014 remain   \n  unchanged from the practice in place prior to his   \n  appointment in 2019 except regarding the mix of     \n  cash and equity in the Chair Fee. The Chair Fee is  \n  payable 50% in deferred shares of Citi\u2019s common     \n  stock and 50% in cash or deferred shares of Citi\u2019s  \n  common stock. As we disclosed in last year\u2019s proxy  \n  statement, when appointed as Chair, Mr. Dugan       \n  agreed to accept the first two elements of Chair    \n  compensation, which consist of the Chair Fee of     \n  $500,000 and the Retainer and Deferred Stock Award  \n  of $225,000 that all Directors receive. However,    \n  while Mr. Dugan actively participates in the four   \n  Board Committees of which he is a member\u2014Audit;     \n  Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs;          \n  Personnel and Compensation; and Risk Management as  \n  well as certain ad hoc committees\u2014and attends as    \n  many meetings of Citi\u2019s other Committees as is      \n  feasible, he waives the Committee Fees to which he  \n  is entitled. His total annual compensation in 2020  \n  was therefore $725,000, as we disclosed in 2020,    \n  and remains the same for 2021. The Board continues  \n  to believe this amount is appropriate in            \n  reflection of the evolving role of the Chair and    \n  the virtually full-time nature of the Chair\u2019s       \n  responsibilities. In reaching this conclusion, the  \n  Board considers many factors, including Mr.         \n  Dugan\u2019s extensive experience and knowledge of the   \n  regulatory environment, the time commitment         \n  attributable to both internal and external          \n  responsibilities, and the compensation paid for     \n  similar roles among direct competitors, including   \n  U.S. and non-U.S. banks as well as other            \n  high-profile global organizations.                  \n                                                      \n                                                                \n  What We Do                      What We Don\u2019t Do              \n  \u2713Citi\u2019s Director                                              \n  Compensation Program is                                       \n  primarily equity based.         \u2715Directors who are employees  \n  \u2713Directors have a robust        of Citi or its subsidiaries   \n  Stock Ownership Commitment.     do not receive any            \n  \u2713The maximum number of          compensation for their        \n  shares subject to awards to     services as Directors.        \n  an individual Director in a     \u2715Directors are not paid       \n  calendar year, taken            Meeting Fees.                 \n  together with any cash fees     \u2715Citi does not offer a        \n  paid during the calendar        Retirement Program for its    \n  year to the Director for        Directors.                    \n  services as a member of the     \u2715Directors are not permitted  \n  Board, may not exceed $1        to hedge or pledge their      \n  million in value.

The Board of Directors has determined that all\neight members of the Committee are independent based upon the\nstandards adopted by the Board, which incorporate the\nindependence requirements under applicable laws, rules and\nregulations. Management is responsible for the financial\nreporting process, the system of internal controls, including\ninternal control over financial reporting, risk management and\nprocedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting\nstandards and applicable laws and regulations. KPMG LLP,\nCitigroup\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\n(\u201cindependent auditors\u201d) is responsible for the integrated audit\nof the consolidated financial statements and internal control\nover financial reporting. The Committee\u2019s responsibility is to\nmonitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The members\nof the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice\nof accounting or auditing and are not professionals in these\nfields. The Committee relies, without independent verification,\non the information provided to it and on the representations\nmade by management regarding the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, that the financial statements\nhave been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that such\nfinancial statements have been prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. The Committee also relies on the opinions of the\nindependent auditors of the consolidated financial statements\nand the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting. The Committee\u2019s meetings facilitate communication\namong the members of the Committee, management, the internal\nauditors, and Citigroup\u2019s independent auditors. The Committee\nseparately met with each of the internal and independent\nauditors with and without management, to discuss the results of\ntheir examinations and their observations and recommendations\nregarding Citigroup\u2019s internal controls. The Committee discussed\nwith the independent auditors the matters required to be\ndiscussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The\nCommittee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements of Citigroup as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 with management, the internal auditors, and\nCitigroup\u2019s independent auditors. The Committee has received the\nwritten disclosures required by PCAOB Rule 3526, \u201cCommunication\nwith Audit Committees Concerning Independence.\u201d The Committee\ndiscussed with the independent auditors any relationships that\nmay have an impact on their objectivity and independence and\nsatisfied itself as to the auditors\u2019 independence. The Committee\nhas reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid to the\nindependent auditors for audit, audit-related and tax compliance\nand other services. The Committee concluded that the provision\nof services by the independent auditors did not impair their\nindependence. Based on the above-mentioned review and\ndiscussions, and subject to the limitations on our role and\nresponsibilities described above and in the Committee charter,\nthe Committee recommended to the Board that Citigroup\u2019s audited\nconsolidated financial statements be included in Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020\nfor filing with the SEC.

Disclosure of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm Fees The following is a description of the fees\nearned by KPMG for services rendered to Citi for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019:\n                                                          \n                         2020                       2019  \n                                 -in millions of dollars  \n  Audit Fees            $70.6                      $67.3  \n  Audit-Related Fees    $23.0                      $20.7  \n  Tax Fees               $5.0                       $9.4  \n  All Other Fees         $0.0                       $0.0  \n  Total Fees            $98.6                      $97.4  \n                                                          \nAudit Fees This includes fees earned by KPMG in connection with\nthe annual integrated audits of Citi\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and internal control over financial reporting under\nSarbanes-Oxley Section 404, audits of subsidiary financial\nstatements, comfort letters and consents related to SEC\nregistration statements and other capital-raising activities and\ncertain reports relating to Citi\u2019s regulatory filings, reports\non internal control reviews required by regulators, evaluation\nof accounting for completed transactions, and reviews of Citi\u2019s\ninterim financial statements. Audit-Related Fees This includes\nfees for services performed by KPMG that are closely related to\naudits and in many cases could only be provided by our\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Such services may\ninclude accounting consultations, internal control reviews not\nrequired by regulators, securitization-related services,\nemployee benefit plan audits, certain attestation services as\nwell as certain agreed upon procedures, and due diligence\nservices related to contemplated mergers and acquisitions. Tax\nFees This includes preparation and review of corporate tax\nreturns, expense allocation reports for tax purposes, and other\ntax compliance services. All Other Fees Citi engaged KPMG for\none service in 2020 classified under \u201cAll Other Fees.\u201d The\naggregate fee amount of $10,393 is included in the total amount;\nhowever, due to rounding, this fee is not represented in the\n\u201cAll Other Fees\u201d column. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  72  PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT      \n      REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                         \n                                                                \nApproval of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nServices and Fees Citi\u0092s Audit Committee has reviewed and\napproved all fees earned in 2020 and 2019 by Citi\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm and actively monitored the\nrelationship between audit and non-audit services provided. The\nAudit Committee has concluded that the fees earned by KPMG were\nconsistent with the maintenance of the external auditors\u0092\nindependence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit\nCommittee must pre-approve all services provided and fees earned\nby Citi\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm. The\nAudit Committee annually considers the provision of audit\nservices and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined audit\nfees, audit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with specific\ndollar-value limits for each category of service. The Audit\nCommittee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific\nengagements that are not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal\ncontrol and certain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed\npre-approved fee amounts. On an interim basis, any proposed\nengagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-\napproved service may be presented to the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee for approval and to the full Audit Committee at its\nnext regular meeting. The Accounting Firm Engagement Standard is\nthe primary basis upon which management ensures the independence\nof its independent registered public accounting firm.\nAdministration of the Standard is centralized in, and monitored\nby, Citi senior corporate financial management, which reports\nthe engagements earned by KPMG throughout the year to the Audit\nCommittee. The Standard also includes limitations on the hiring\nof KPMG partners and other professionals to ensure that Citi\nsatisfies applicable auditor independence rules. KPMG has served\nas the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi and\nits predecessors since 1969. Citi and its Audit Committee engage\nin an annual review of KPMG in connection with the Audit\nCommittee\u0092s consideration of whether to recommend that\nstockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as Citi\u0092s independent\nauditor for the following year. In that review, the Audit\nCommittee considers both the continued independence of KPMG and\nwhether retaining KPMG is in the best interests of Citi and its\nstockholders. Citi\u0092s management prepares an annual assessment of\nKPMG for the Audit Committee that includes (i) the results of a\nmanagement survey of KPMG\u0092s overall performance; (ii) an\nanalysis of KPMG\u0092s known legal risks and significant proceedings\nthat may impair KPMG\u0092s ability to perform Citi\u0092s annual audit;\nand (iii) KPMG\u0092s fees and services provided to Citi both on an\nabsolute basis, noting, of course, that KPMG does not provide\nany non-audit services, other than those described in the Proxy\nStatement, to Citi, and compared to services provided by other\nauditing firms to peer institutions. In addition, KPMG reviews\nwith the Audit Committee its analysis of its independence in\naccordance with the Accounting Firm Engagement Standard and\nPCAOB Rule 3526. In performing its analysis for 2021, the Audit\nCommittee considered the length of time KPMG has been Citi\u0092s\nindependent auditor, the breadth and complexity of Citi\u0092s\nbusiness and its global footprint and the resulting demands\nplaced on its auditing firm in terms of expertise in Citi\u0092s\nbusinesses, the quantity and quality of staff, and global reach.\nKPMG's history and familiarity with Citi's businesses leads to\ngreater audit effectiveness as well as a lower fee structure.\nThe Audit Committee recognized the ability of KPMG to provide\nboth the necessary expertise to audit Citi\u0092s business and the\nmatching global footprint to audit Citi worldwide and other\nfactors, including the policies that KPMG follows with respect\nto rotation of the key audit personnel, so that there is a new\npartner-in-charge at least every five years. Citi\u0092s Audit\nCommittee oversees the process for, and ultimately approves, the\nselection of the independent auditor\u0092s lead engagement partner\nat the five-year mandatory rotation period. Mandatory lead audit\npartner rotation ensures a regular influx of fresh perspective\nbalanced by the benefits of having a tenured auditor with deep\ninstitutional knowledge of Citi. At the Audit Committee\u0092s\ninstruction, KPMG selects candidates to be considered for the\nlead engagement partner role, who are then interviewed by\nmembers of Citi\u0092s senior management. After considering the\ncandidates recommended by KPMG, senior management makes a\nrecommendation to the Audit Committee regarding the new lead\nengagement partner. After discussing the qualifications of the\nproposed lead engagement partner with the current lead\nengagement partner and senior leadership of KPMG, the members of\nthe Audit Committee, individually and/ or as a group, interview\nthe leading candidate. The Audit Committee then considers the\nappointment and votes as an Audit Committee on the selection.\nThe Audit Committee also reviewed external data on audit quality\nand performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and its\npeer firms. Based on the results of its review this year, the\nAudit Committee concluded that KPMG is independent and that it\nis in the best interests of Citi and its investors to appoint\nKPMG to serve as Citi\u0092s independent registered accounting firm\nfor 2021.\n                                                                \n  Board Recommendation                                          \n  The Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of KPMG as       \n  Citi\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for      \n  2021.                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n      \n  73  \n      \nProposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2020 Executive\nCompensation We are seeking a nonbinding, advisory vote\napproving the compensation of our named executive officers\ndisclosed in this Proxy Statement, as required by Section 14A\nand Rule 14a-21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

At the same time, while the value of our franchise was\nevident in our financial performance in an unprecedented\nbusiness environment, and important parts of our business had\nstrong financial results, our overall financial performance fell\nshort of our aspirations, both in absolute terms and relative to\npeers. Citi\u2019s earnings were substantially reduced by a higher\nallowance for credit loss build during 2020 which was a function\nof the macroeconomic environment. By linking 70% and 60%,\nrespectively, of total compensation to the value of our stock\nfor our CEO and other named executive officers, we ensured that\ncompensation decisions are aligned over time with stockholder\nreturns. 2020 named executive officer compensation decisions\nreflected that mix of factors. Total compensation for half of\nour Executive Management Team was down in 2020 compared to 2019.\nMr. Corbat\u2019s compensation was down by more than 20% in 2020\ncompared to 2019. The above table is not intended to be a\nsubstitute for the reporting of compensation in accordance with\nSEC rules as shown in the 2020 Summary Compensation Table on\npage 102 of this Proxy Statement.\n               \n  Performance  \n               \nThe following summarizes highlights of Company performance in\nthe four pillars under CART (our Compensation Accountability\nRationale Tool) that are factored into the Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s compensation determinations for our named executive\nofficers for 2020.

Our shortcomings in the management of risk and\ncontrol had a significant impact on the compensation of our\nExecutive Management Team in 2020. The Compensation Committee\ndetermined individual risk and control performance and then\nimposed a reduction for the shared accountability concerning\nrisk and control across all Executive Management Team members.\nOur response to the Consent Orders is far from limited to a one-\ntime impact on compensation. Rather, we have embarked on a\ntransformation, including modernization of our operations and a\ncontinued evolution in our culture concerning risk and control.\nWe are committed to addressing the challenges represented by the\nConsent Orders and achieving our transformation goals. In\nfurtherance of our transformation efforts, we are making\nsignificant investments in our infrastructure and control and\nhave made this work a strategic priority for our firm. We have\nalso centralized management of our transformation under a new\nChief Administrative Officer, and we are planning a redesign of\nour performance assessment efforts throughout the Company. Every\nmember of our leadership team is involved in the transformation\nand will play a key, hands-on role in the implementation. In\naddition, we have assembled an extraordinary team of top talent\nfrom across the firm with representatives from the businesses\nand global functions to lead six different transformation\nprograms. We are putting our best minds into this effort and\nhave a detailed, integrated approach addressing the needs of our\nclients, investors and regulators. We appreciate our regulators\u2019\nacknowledgments in the Consent Orders that we have begun taking\nthe necessary actions. In 2019, we adopted a disciplined and\nsystematic process for factoring risk and control into our\ncompensation decisions for our Executive Management Team, which\nwas expanded to approximately 400 of our most senior employees\nin 2020. Also during 2020, the Compensation Committee revised\nthe ranges of potential impacts to compensation based on CART\npillar ratings, to increase the potential impact of negative\nrisk and control management on compensation.

Information\nconcerning Ms. Fraser\u2019s compensation as CEO will appear in the\nProxy Statement relating to our 2022 Annual Meeting of\nStockholders. Our Executive Management Team is focused on\ncontinuing the transformation and improving our returns under\nMs. Fraser\u2019s leadership. As the world\u2019s most global bank, we\nwill continue to invest in our infrastructure and our risk and\ncontrol management to ensure that we operate in a safe and sound\nmanner and serve our clients and customers with excellence.\n              \n  PAY EQUITY  \n              \nOur work to champion equality is reflected in our approach to\npay equity within our firm. In 2018, we were the first large\nU.S. financial institution to publicly release the results of a\npay equity review. Our pay equity review as disclosed in 2018\ncompared the compensation of women to men in the U.S., the U.K.\nand Germany and of minorities to non-minorities in the U.S. Our\nreview adjusted pay to account for a number of factors to make\nthe comparisons meaningful, including job function, level, and\ngeography, and we made changes to compensation, where\nappropriate on an individual basis, as a result of the review.\nIn 2019, we extended our adjusted pay equity review to include\nemployees globally, and we found that women globally were paid,\non average, 99% of what men were paid and that there was no\nstatistically significant difference between what U.S.\nminorities and non-minorities were paid. As in the prior year,\nwe made changes to compensation, where appropriate on an\nindividual basis, as a result of the review. In 2019, we were\nagain first among our peers in the transparency of our approach\nto pay equity. In that year, we were the first large U.S.\ncompany to disclose our unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for women\nglobally and U.S. minorities, which measures median total\ncompensation unadjusted for factors such as job function, level,\nand geography. The analysis showed that the median pay for women\nglobally for 2018 was 71% of the median for men, and the median\npay for U.S. minorities in 2018 was 93% of the median for non-\nminorities. In 2020, we again looked at our adjusted pay equity\nand \u201craw\u201d pay gaps and found that, on an adjusted basis, women\nglobally are paid, on average, more than 99% of what men are\npaid and there is no statistically significant difference in\nadjusted compensation for U.S. minorities and non-minorities.\nFollowing the review, we again made changes to compensation,\nwhere appropriate on an individual basis, as part of the\ncompensation cycle. The 2020 raw pay gap analysis showed that\nthe median pay for women globally is more than 74% of the median\nfor men, up from 73% last year and 71% in 2018, and that the\nmedian pay for U.S. minorities is just under 94% of the median\nfor non-minorities, which is similar to last year and up from\n93% in 2018. Our work to address pay equity and representation\nis continuous. We made significant progress in 2020 and remain\ncommitted to reducing the raw pay gap numbers over time by\nincreasing the representation of women and U.S. minorities in\nsenior and higher-paying roles. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n                                                                \n  78  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020          \n      EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                    \n                                                                \nClient and Franchise The following highlights were considered by\nthe Compensation Committee as important examples of our efforts\nto solidify client relationships and strengthen our franchise\nduring 2020.\n                                         \n  ENABLING GROWTH AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS  \n                                         \nOur mission is to serve as a trusted partner to our clients by\nresponsibly providing financial services that enable growth and\neconomic progress. Our core activities are safeguarding assets,\nlending money, making payments and accessing the capital markets\non behalf of our clients. We have 200 years of experience\nhelping our clients meet the world\u2019s toughest challenges and\nembrace its greatest opportunities. We have an obligation to act\nresponsibly. We also know that acting responsibly and\nsustainably will help to drive value for our different\nstakeholders and for our Company. Our continuity of business and\ncrisis management groups are managing protocols in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic by providing for the safety and well-being\nof our staff, while continuing to maintain high levels of client\nservicing across all of the markets in which we operate. As the\nmajority of Citi colleagues\u2014roughly 80%\u2014around the world are\nworking remotely, we are pursuing a slow and measured return in\nlocations where local guidelines permit, beginning with only a\nsmall number of colleagues. Also, our response teams continue to\nconsult with health experts and follow local government\nguidelines in determining the safest return to office for each\nlocation. In addition, we are supporting those immediately\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were one of the first\nbanks in the U.S. to announce temporary assistance measures for\npandemic-impacted consumer customers by offering relief\nprimarily in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers and\nsuspending foreclosures for U.S. mortgages. We remain committed\nto discussing assistance options with customers that continue to\nexperience financial hardship on a case-by-case basis. Through\nour businesses, we address some of society\u2019s greatest\nchallenges\u2014an imperative stated in our mission and an idea that\nshapes our decisions every day. The need for action grew in\nurgency and scope in 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic and calls for racial equity and systemic change in the\nU.S. Mirroring our mission of enabling progress, our businesses\nand community investments work together to contribute positive\nsocietal impact through numerous initiatives, including the\nfollowing:\n                                                                \n     In 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation announced more than  \n     $1 billion in strategic business investments, including    \n  \u25cf  $100 million in Citi Foundation grants, to help close the  \n     racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the    \n     U.S. Beginning on the bottom of this page is a further     \n     discussion of our Action for Racial Equity initiative.     \n     Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges      \n     facing our society, and the COVID-19 pandemic reminded us  \n     that our health, our economic success and our environment  \n     are all inextricably linked. In 2020, we launched our new  \n     five-year Sustainable Progress Strategy to play a leading  \n  \u25cf  role in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.    \n     At the core of our new strategy is a commitment to         \n     finance and facilitate $250 billion in environmental       \n     solutions, as well as to continue focusing on climate      \n     risk assessment and reducing the operational footprint of  \n     our facilities globally.                                   \n     We support entrepreneurs in emerging markets through       \n     efforts like Scaling Enterprise, a $100 million loan       \n     guarantee facility and joint effort with the U.S.          \n  \u25cf  International Development Finance Corporation and the      \n     Ford Foundation launched in 2019. Similarly, we provide    \n     equity capital to U.S.-based companies addressing          \n     societal challenges through our $200 million Citi Impact   \n     Fund established in January 2020.                          \n     Potential entrepreneurs today have little chance without   \n     access to the web. Programs like Cobro Digital, launched   \n     in Mexico in 2018, have helped to bridge gaps in digital   \n     access by enabling clients to send invoices and payments   \n  \u25cf  using QR codes on their phones at no cost. Building on     \n     this work, in 2020, Citibanamex partnered with PepsiCo     \n     Alimentos Mexico and Amigo PAQ to provide digital          \n     financial tools to more than 800,000 small, underbanked    \n     retailers who are part of the PepsiCo distribution         \n     network.                                                   \n     We and the Citi Foundation champion philanthropic causes   \n     to increase economic opportunity. In 2020, we and the      \n  \u25cf  Citi Foundation expanded our Pathways to Progress job      \n     skills-building initiative, led by a Citi Foundation       \n     investment of $100 million, to improve employability and   \n     economic opportunity for young people around the           \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                        \n  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020  79  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                \n                                                        \n                                                                \n     world.

Additionally, in the immediate  \n     aftermath of the death of George Floyd in 2020, we gave    \n     more than $10 million to Black-led organizations fighting  \n     for racial justice.                                        \n     Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the COVID-19       \n  \u25cf  pandemic, Citi volunteers contributed 218,488 hours of     \n     service in 2020.                                           \n                                                                \n                            \n  ACTION FOR RACIAL EQUITY  \n                            \nThe events of 2020 put a spotlight on social issues confronting\ncommunities around the globe. There is a need to do better for\nvarious reasons, including to create an environment in which\nbusinesses can grow and prosper by meeting the evolving needs of\neconomically thriving communities with racially diverse talent.\nAccordingly, we believe that responsible businesses must\ncontribute to solutions. The recently published Citi Global\nPerspectives & Solutions report entitled, \u201cClosing the Racial\nInequality Gaps,\u201d found if the U.S. had closed key racial gaps\nfor Black Americans in wages, housing, education and investment\n20 years ago, $16 trillion could have been added to the U.S.\neconomy. If these gaps are closed today, $5 trillion could be\nadded to U.S. gross domestic product over the next five years.\nIn September 2020, we and the Citi Foundation announced more\nthan $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the\nracial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S. Our\nAction for Racial Equity is a comprehensive approach to:\n                                                                \n                          Many communities of color lack        \n                          access to traditional banking         \n  Providing greater       services that are the foundation of   \n  access to banking       financial stability and thriving      \n  and credit in           communities. Economic security is     \n  communities of color    also hampered by insufficient access  \n                          to credit, which makes it hard to     \n                          qualify for affordable mortgages and  \n                          small business loans.                 \n                          Black-owned businesses have long      \n                          faced obstacles in obtaining loans.   \n                          They are the most likely to apply     \n  Increasing              for bank financing, but get turned    \n  investment in           down at twice the rate as white       \n  Black-owned             business owners. This financing gap   \n  businesses              is especially pronounced in the       \n                          start-up world, where studies show    \n                          that Black entrepreneurs receive      \n                          only 1% of venture capital funding.   \n                          Homeownership is a key way to build   \n                          wealth and equity, and safe,          \n                          affordable housing is an important    \n                          platform for financial stability.     \n  Expanding               However, Black homeownership is at    \n  homeownership           its lowest level since the 1960s. In  \n  among Black             addition, rental housing in many      \n  Americans               urban areas across the country is     \n                          scarce and too expensive.             \n                          Compounding this crisis is the        \n                          near-absence of minority-owned real   \n                          estate developers in the affordable   \n                          housing industry.                     \n                          Advancing racial equity requires a    \n                          more intentional focus on the         \n                          challenges faced by communities of    \n  Advancing anti-         color and a commitment to becoming    \n  racist practices        an anti-racist institution.

Consistent with our\nCompensation Philosophy, we design our executive pay program to\nmotivate balanced behaviors. The compensation of our executive\nofficers is determined based on a disciplined policy of goal\nsetting and measurement and assessment of performance against\npre-established goals. Transparency, discipline and performance\nfeedback are key factors in our approach to executive officer\ncompensation. Elements of Annual Compensation The total\nincentive award granted to executive officers is paid out in\nthree parts: annual cash bonus, deferred stock awards, the value\nof which depends on our stock price, and performance share units\n(PSUs). Our incentive awards are balanced between annual and\nlong-term components, with the majority of incentive\ncompensation delivered in awards that vest over multiple years.\nIn determining the percentages to grant of each award type, the\nCompensation Committee considered applicable regulatory\nrequirements and guidelines for deferral as well as market\npractices.

Whitaker and Mr. Ybarra are employed in our London office.\nTheir compensation is designed to comply with U.K. and E.U.\nregulatory guidance and, therefore, differs from the general\nstructure shown in the table above. Mr. Ybarra\u2019s and Mr.\nWhitaker\u2019s total incentive award must not exceed two times their\nrespective fixed compensation. They each receive a fixed role-\nbased allowance based on certain guidelines related to the\nsignificance of their respective roles. Their entire incentive\naward is deferred (with no annual bonus component) and is\ngranted in the form of a Deferred Stock Award and a Deferred\nCash Award. Our Process The following summarizes the principal\nelements of our process for setting incentive compensation for\nour named executive officers. Set forth on pages 87-88 is a\ndetailed description of how we take risk into account in our\ncompensation process and award features.\n                               \n  CART PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT  \n                               \nWe adopted CART in 2020 as a tool for administering our new\nprinciples that is an integral part of our compensation\nframework. Although CART is only a process tool, not a new set\nof performance criteria or metrics, it resulted in significantly\nincreased transparency, discipline and thoughtfulness with\nrespect to the impact of risk and control management on\ncompensation decisions. While CART requires a notably\ndisciplined approach to year-end www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n                                                                \n  82  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020          \n      EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                    \n                                                                \nperformance assessment, its most important feature is that it\nrequires managers to provide a detailed, deep and broad\nexplanation of performance across each of the four CART pillars\n\u2014 Risk and Control, Financial, Client and Franchise, and\nLeadership \u2014 to support compensation decisions. In particular,\nCART creates a comprehensive record evidencing how risk was\nconsidered in compensation decisions. These comprehensive\ndescriptions enable us to systematically hold each senior\nmanager accountable in a disciplined way for management of risk\nand control and for determining compensation. We think that it\nis an important step forward in our transformation plan. Each\nexecutive\u2019s total incentive award (including the annual cash\nbonus component of the total award) is based on our overall\nachievements, individual executive performance against\napplicable goals and a market benchmarking process. The metrics\nand goals for each named executive officer\u2019s total incentive\naward are contained in the executive\u2019s scorecard, which is\ndeveloped early in each compensation cycle. At the same time,\nthe market benchmarking process, with market rates of pay\nadjusted to reflect each named executive officer\u2019s experience,\nand the scope of his or her role in our system, is determined.\nThe scorecard results are fed into CART. CART write-ups for each\nof the four CART pillars are completed for each named executive\nofficer. The Compensation Committee contributes to and assesses\nthose write-ups. The write-ups, together with the adjusted\nmarket-based benchmarking results, form the basis for the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s determination of incentive compensation\namounts. Under our compensation framework, our Compensation\nCommittee uses a five-step process when making final\ndeterminations regarding named executive officer incentive\ncompensation. The steps are illustrated in the following\ngraphic, and summarized immediately below the graphic.

A performance   \n  \u25cf  rating (pillar rating) is assigned for each performance    \n     pillar on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being \u201cExceptional\u201d    \n     and 5 being \u201cNot Effective,\u201d reflecting a subjective       \n     assessment of the executive\u2019s performance.                 \n     Each named executive officer is categorized into one of    \n     four classifications, which are driven by the line of      \n     defense designations under our Risk Governance Framework.  \n     We have established prescribed compensation adjustment     \n  \u25cf  ranges by pillar and a pillar rating for each of these     \n     four classifications. In order to align potential          \n     compensation impacts with the executive\u2019s role and drive   \n     desired behavior on performance outcomes, the              \n     compensation ranges vary based on the pillar rating for    \n     each classification.                                       \n     The Compensation Committee retains the authority to        \n  \u25cf  adjust goals, pillar ratings, and compensation adjustment  \n     ranges during the year, if appropriate.                    \n     The Compensation Committee rates the CEO\u2019s performance,    \n  \u25cf  and the CEO and Compensation Committee rate the            \n     performance of the other named executive officers.         \n                                                                \nStep 3 \u2013 Evaluation of Market Pay\n                                                                \n     The Compensation Committee reviews estimated market pay    \n     to determine a market benchmark for each named executive   \n     officer role. Ranges are developed based on public         \n  \u25cf  information and third-party market surveys of              \n     compensation for the same or comparable roles at peer      \n     firms. This market benchmark is then adjusted based on     \n     the scope of the role at Citi, and experience of the       \n     executive.                                                 \n     This practice helps us set named executive officer pay at  \n  \u25cf  levels that reflect market pay, based on varying levels    \n     of performance.                                            \n                                                                \nStep 4 \u2013 Linking Performance to Compensation\n                                                                \n     The Compensation Committee then uses CART to apply each    \n     named executive officer\u2019s performance rating for each      \n     pillar against the prescribed compensation adjustment      \n  \u25cf  range to determine an appropriate compensation adjustment  \n     for each pillar. The net aggregate compensation            \n     adjustments are then applied to the adjusted market        \n     benchmark to determine a forecasted compensation amount.   \n     The Compensation Committee thinks that the simultaneous    \n  \u25cf  evaluation of scorecard performance and market pay is the  \n     most effective approach to aligning pay and performance    \n     in an industry where market levels of pay are volatile.    \n                                                                \nStep 5 \u2013 Committee Determination\n                                                                \n     Based on the evaluation of the scorecard ratings and       \n     market pay described in Step 4, the Compensation           \n     Committee, exercising its fiduciary judgment, determines   \n  \u25cf  the final award amount for each named executive officer.   \n     The qualitative factors (such as risk behaviors) that      \n     inform the decision are explained in detail within each    \n     named executive officer\u2019s CART write-up.                   \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  84  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020          \n      EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                      COMPENSATION                              \n                      GOVERNANCE                                \n                      PRACTICES                                 \n                      We have strong                            \n                      compensation                              \n                      governance                                \n                      practices that are                        \n                      regularly refined                         \n                      as a result of                            \n                      engagement with                           \n                      stockholders and                          \n                      regulators and our                        \n                      attention to                              \n                      evolving best                             \n                      practices.                                \n  PRACTICES WE                             PRACTICES WE AVOID   \n  EMPLOY                                                        \n  Ongoing investor                                              \n  outreach.The                                                  \n  Compensation                                                  \n  Committee and                                                 \n  management conduct                                            \n  regular                                                       \n  stockholder                                                   \n  engagement to                                                 \n  solicit feedback                                              \n  on compensation                                               \n  and governance.                                               \n  Performance-based                                             \n  compensation.For                                              \n  2020, variable                                                \n  performance-based                                             \n  incentive                                                     \n  compensation was                                              \n  more than 90% of                                              \n  CEO annual                                                    \n  compensation.

In 2016, the Compensation\nCommittee, with input from its independent compensation\nconsultant, established the compensation peer group we currently\nuse to determine market pay ranges. The Compensation Committee\nevaluates the compensation peer group on an annual basis to\nensure that the group continues to be appropriate. The\nCompensation Committee continues to believe that a U.S.-based\npeer group reflects the relevant market for executive talent and\nthe relevant regulatory environment for our executive\ncompensation. We chose the peers because they operate in one or\nmore lines of business that are similar to ours and compete in\nsimilar labor markets, although most do not have global scale\ncomparable to ours.\n                                                                \n                      2020 COMPENSATION                         \n                      PEER GROUP                                \n  AIG (AIG)           Goldman Sachs (GS)    Prudential (PRU)    \n  American Express    JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  \n  (AXP)                                                         \n  Bank of America     MetLife (MET)         Wells Fargo (WFC)   \n  (BAC)                                                         \n  BNY Mellon (BK)     Morgan Stanley (MS)                       \n  Capital One (COF)   PNC (PNC)                                 \n                                                                \nAll firms in the compensation peer group are included in\npreparing the market data for the CEO and CFO roles. Not all\nfirms in the compensation peer group have roles comparable to\nour named executive officer roles other than the CEO and CFO\nroles. In evaluating the market for named executive officer\ncompensation, the Compensation Committee focuses on compensation\nfor comparable roles at the U.S.-based global banks with lines\nof business and scale similar to ours. This group includes Bank\nof America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and\nWells Fargo, and the information is compiled with the assistance\nof an outside third-party survey firm using a proprietary\ndatabase. For named executive officers other than the CEO or\nCFO, only these U.S. global banks are typically included in the\nevaluation. In selecting the compensation peer group, the\nCompensation Committee uses size-based metrics as primary\nscreening criteria among financial services firms. Due to the\nabsence of a sufficient number of comparably sized peers, the\nresult is a peer group where we are above the 75th percentile in\nsize, meaning that the market for target compensation prior to\nconsideration of performance would be the upper quartile based\non correlation between size and pay opportunity. Where we pay\nexecutives above median, the size and scope of their\nresponsibilities and their performance tend to be critical\nfactors in determining pay ranges.\n                                                    \n  2019 CITI POSITIONING RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES  \n                                                    \n                                       \n  (1)  MET employees as of 10/1/2020.  \n                                       \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  86  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020          \n      EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                    \n                                                                \nStockholder Engagement The following summarizes our engagement\nwith stockholders and our stockholders\u2019 feedback concerning our\nexecutive compensation program in 2020.\n                                                   \n  STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK  \n                                                   \nOur executive compensation program reflects feedback received\nfrom investors through an extensive stockholder engagement\nprocess.

The feedback we received on our        \n     executive pay program was broadly favorable, reflecting    \n     the numerous changes made in previous years in direct      \n     response to stockholder comments. Noting no concerns that  \n     merited discussion, investors representing approximately   \n     10% of our outstanding shares declined our invitation to   \n     participate in the Spring 2020 engagement effort. In       \n     addition, notwithstanding our request for engagement,      \n     investors representing about 1% of our outstanding shares  \n     did not respond to our request.                            \n     Fall 2020 through Winter 2021: In the Fall of 2020 and     \n     into early 2021, we conducted a second round of            \n     engagement with stockholders representing about 32% of     \n     our outstanding shares in a series of meetings that        \n     focused on sustainability issues, including climate        \n  \u25cf  change and human capital management. In the area of human  \n     capital management, the topics included executive          \n     compensation practices, diverse representation in senior   \n     roles at Citi, talent development and succession           \n     planning, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and       \n     gender pay equity.                                         \n                                                                \nAll the material features of our executive compensation program\nare designed to be aligned with stockholder interests and in\nmost cases are directly responsive to stockholder feedback we\nhave received during engagement as outlined above and in\nprevious years, including the following:\n                                                                \n     Extensive disclosure of pay rationales.

Our PSU program includes  \n     two performance metrics: return on tangible common equity  \n     and tangible book value per share, which are operational   \n  \u25cf  metrics used by investors to assess our performance. We    \n     disclose the target goals for the metrics at the start of  \n     the performance period to enable stockholders to assess    \n     the rigor of our goals.                                    \n     Rigorous targets. Our PSU target goals routinely require   \n     substantial operational improvements for target payout     \n  \u25cf  and exceptional performance for maximum payout. Targets    \n     for 2020 PSU awards are described on pages 97-98 of this   \n     Proxy Statement.                                           \n     Robust clawbacks. Incentive compensation is subject to     \n  \u25cf  broad clawbacks, as described on page 88 of this Proxy     \n     Statement.                                                 \n     Peer group. Our 13-firm compensation peer group is a       \n     reasonable representation of the market for executive      \n  \u25cf  talent in which we compete. We are above the 75th          \n     percentile in size compared to the 13 firms in the peer    \n     group.                                                     \n     Limit on cash bonuses. We have a $20 million limit on      \n     individual executive officer cash bonuses, and the         \n  \u25cf  largest cash bonus actually paid to any of our executive   \n     officer over the past three years ($7.8 million) is well   \n     below that limit.                                          \n     Governance. We have strong compensation governance         \n  \u25cf  practices, including a disciplined and systematic process  \n     for taking risk into account in compensation decisions.    \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                        \n  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020  87  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                \n                                                        \n                          \n  OUR SAY ON PAY RESULTS  \n                          \nWe were pleased with the positive feedback from our stockholders\nand their endorsement of our executive compensation program,\nwhich resulted in a 91.7% favorable say-on-pay vote at our 2020\nAnnual Meeting. Risk- and Control-Related Aspects of our\nCompensation Program Our compensation programs are designed in\naccordance with our responsibility to assume only risks that are\nprudent and to effectively manage those risks to protect the\nfranchise. Our programs reinforce and are aligned with our risk\ngovernance framework.\n                                     \n  IMPACT ON INCENTIVE AWARD AMOUNTS  \n                                     \nOur Compensation Philosophy requires us to consider risk\nmanagement when making discretionary incentive compensation\nawards. Our incentive compensation awards have the following\nimportant elements:\n                                                                \n     Our executive compensation framework takes risk and        \n  \u25cf  control management into account in a number of ways,       \n     including:                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u27a2  using financial metrics that reflect risk as an element    \n     of each executive\u2019s financial goals;                       \n     evaluating risk management performance, including          \n  \u27a2  effectiveness of the control environment, as part of the   \n     performance assessment;                                    \n  \u27a2  taking adverse risk outcomes into account when             \n     determining incentive compensation; and                    \n  \u27a2  providing for forfeiture of the deferred portion of        \n     incentive awards based on adverse risk outcomes.           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     CART takes risk management and control performance into    \n     account as one of the four pillars of our compensation     \n     determination process for executive officers.              \n     We systematically identify employees who, individually or  \n     as part of a group, have authorities or responsibilities   \n     that may subject the firm to material risks. Through a     \n     systematic annual process, we identify the material risks  \n     to the firm and then identify employees with influence     \n  \u25cf  over those risks. We refer to those employees as \u201ccovered  \n     employees.\u201d The compensation structure for covered         \n     employees, including the named executive officers,         \n     includes substantial deferrals and clawbacks intended to   \n     cover a range of behaviors. The portion of incentive       \n     awards that are subject to deferral increases with the     \n     size of incentive awards.                                  \n     Our executive compensation governance process ensures      \n     that risk and control performance is taken into account    \n  \u25cf  in evaluating performance for covered employees. CART      \n     requires the following at year-end for each employee       \n     subject to CART review:                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u27a2  managers of employees who are subject to CART review must  \n     review goals and performance metrics for those employees;  \n     employees subject to CART review must complete a           \n     self-assessment and their managers must complete a         \n  \u27a2  manager assessment.  These both use enhanced performance   \n     metrics with a significant focus on risk and control       \n     behavior and outcomes;                                     \n  \u27a2  managers must use those appraisals to make compensation    \n     decisions; and                                             \n     managers must provide a detailed explanation for each      \n  \u27a2  employee subject to CART review for their compensation     \n     decisions.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Employees subject to CART can receive adjustments   \n  to their incentive awards in amounts ranging from   \n  negative 40% of total compensation to positive 20%  \n  of total compensation to reflect their performance  \n  assessment for the Risk and Control pillar. In      \n  addition, the Compensation Committee has reserved   \n  discretion to make adjustments outside of that      \n  range.                                              \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  88  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020          \n      EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Regulatory matters are reflected in performance            \n     assessments as the Compensation Committee considers        \n  \u25cf  regulatory matters when awarding executive incentive       \n     compensation, and regulatory-related goals are cascaded    \n     to other employee performance evaluations as appropriate   \n     to the applicable roles throughout Citi.                   \n     Our Chief Risk Officer reports at least twice annually to  \n     the Compensation Committee on risk levels and trends       \n     across our businesses and on the design and operation of   \n     our incentive compensation program. Our Chief Risk         \n     Officer has reviewed our incentive compensation program    \n     to help ensure that compensation is aligned with           \n  \u25cf  long-term performance in a manner that does not encourage  \n     imprudent or excessive risk-taking. Beginning in 2021,     \n     our Chief Compliance Officer will also report at least     \n     twice annually to the Compensation Committee to help the   \n     Compensation Committee understand and assess the           \n     interplay between our compliance efforts and our           \n     compensation program.

Also, to comply with U.K. and E.U.\nregulatory guidance, additional clawbacks are applicable to Mr.\nYbarra\u2019s and Mr. Whitaker\u2019s incentive awards covering various\ncompliance issues. At a minimum, we will consider whether a\nMaterial Adverse Outcome has occurred and the potential impact\non PSUs and Deferred Cash Awards if there is an annual pretax\nloss at any of the following three reportable financial\nsegments: Citigroup (the entire company), GCB and ICG. We will\nalso consider making public disclosures whenever a decision has\nbeen made to cancel deferred compensation payable to an\nexecutive officer because he or she had significant\nresponsibility for a Material Adverse Outcome or otherwise.

The change diversifies the    \n     performance focus of our metrics by capturing the value    \n  \u25cf  of the Company\u2019s balance sheet, and TBVPS tends to         \n     correlate more closely with the value of our common stock  \n     and is consistent with our goal of sustained and           \n     responsible growth over time.                              \n     We used (i) three-year average RoTCE, rather than using    \n     RoTCE for the last year of the performance period, (ii) a  \n     combination of relative performance against peers and      \n     absolute performance, as the RoTCE measurement, and (iii)  \n  \u25cf  a single RoTCE target, rather than a range. These changes  \n     are a reaction to the challenges of long-term              \n     goal-setting in the uncertain macro-economic environment   \n     and will reinforce our focus on closing our returns gap    \n     to peers.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                  \n  PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT PAYOUTS  \n                                  \nThe chart below illustrates the components of the payout amounts\nfor PSUs settled in 2019 through 2021, illustrating the relative\nimpact of stock price change and operational performance metrics\non grant date value, in order to determine final PSU payout\namounts, for the last three completed PSU performance periods.\nPSU awards granted in 2018 and settled in 2021 based on\nperformance for the years 2018 through 2020 paid out at 28% of\nPSU Grant Date Value primarily as a result of performance\nagainst operational financial metrics during the performance\nperiod.

There have been no\nchanges to the general terms of our Deferred Stock Awards since\n2013. Deferred Cash Awards have been a core element of our risk-\nbalanced approach to awarding incentive compensation and have\nbeen awarded consistently since 2013 to our incentive-eligible\nemployee population, excluding most named executive officers but\nincluding executives who are ineligible for PSUs. Accordingly,\nMr. Whitaker and Mr. Ybarra received Deferred Cash Awards\ninstead of PSUs for their performance in 2020 as an element of\nour approach to compliance with U.K. and E.U. regulatory\nguidance.\n                         \n  DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS  \n                         \n                                                                \n

Representatives of FW Cook attended\nall Compensation Committee meetings during 2020, including\nexecutive sessions as requested, and engaged with Compensation\nCommittee members between meetings. FW Cook advised the\nCompensation Committee regarding the compensation awarded to the\nCEO and other executive officers. FW Cook also provided\nextensive guidance and analysis regarding the Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s and the Board\u2019s responses to our advisory say-on-pay\nvotes, offered market insights, and provided advice to the\nCompensation Committee on our executive compensation plan design\nand the presentation of our programs to stockholders through the\ninvestor outreach process described earlier as well as required\nSEC disclosures. FW Cook also provides advice to the Board on\nnon-executive director compensation. In 2020, FW Cook was paid\nfees of approximately $316,000 for advice given to us. Pursuant\nto SEC and NYSE rules, the Compensation Committee assessed the\nindependence of FW Cook most recently in January 2021 and\ndetermined that FW Cook is independent from our management and\nthat its work for the Compensation Committee has not raised any\nconflicts of interest.

However, Tax Reform amended Section\n162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code by removing the exception\nfor qualified performance-based compensation and expanding it to\ncover the CFO, thereby reducing the potential for deductible\nexecutive compensation for 2018 and later years. Further, once\nany of our employees is considered a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, that person will\nremain a \u201ccovered employee\u201d so long as the person receives\ncompensation from Citi. We do not intend to change our pay-for-\nperformance approach to awarding executive pay even though Tax\nReform eliminated the tax benefits of awarding qualified\nperformance-based compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation\nCommittee awarded named executive officer incentive compensation\nfor 2020 performance under the EPP and subject to its limits on\nexecutive compensation. The EPP specifies a maximum amount that\ncan be awarded to a participant for any year based on\nCitigroup\u2019s income from continuing operations before income\ntaxes. The amount of total incentive actually awarded for the\nyear, however, is determined by the Compensation Committee,\napplying the executive compensation Framework described in this\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis and subject to the\ncondition that we may pay less (but not more) than the maximum.\nFor 2020, the Compensation Committee certified the maximum\namount payable under the EPP as 0.2% of Citigroup pretax\nearnings and exercised its negative discretion to award lesser\namounts under the plan. In addition to this limit on total\nincentive pay, the EPP limits the annual cash bonus portion of\nindividual executive officer incentive pay to $20 million.

Mr. Ybarra\u2019s and Mr. Whitaker\u2019s   \n       Deferred Cash Awards are denominated in British pounds   \n       because they were awarded for years in which they were   \n       employed in London.

Role-based allowances within the U.K. are       \n       awarded based on certain guidelines related to the       \n       significance of the role. Mr. Ybarra\u2019s and Mr.           \n       Whitaker\u2019s base salary and role-based allowance are      \n  (8)  paid in British pounds, and the total is shown as        \n       converted from British pounds to U.S. dollars at an      \n       average 2020 conversion rate (1 British pound =          \n       1.2854875 U.S. dollars).

The amounts     \n       reported in the 2020 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table   \n  (1)  for the Performance Share Units are the values at the    \n       grant date under applicable accounting principles,       \n       which take into account the probable outcome of the      \n       performance conditions.

Citi\nhas not granted extra years of credited service under any\nretirement plan to any of the named executive officers. Ms.\nFraser and Mr. Whitaker have never been eligible to participate\nin a defined benefit pension plan under the terms of Citi\u2019s\nbroad-based retirement programs in effect in their employment\ncountries; they have participated only in defined contribution\nretirement plans since the commencement of their employment at\nCiti. The following describes the pension plans listed in the\n2020 Pension Benefits Table. The Citigroup Pension Plan. The\npurpose of this broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plan is to\nprovide retirement income on a tax-deferred basis to all\neligible U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2006, The\nCitigroup Pension Plan was closed to new members and generally\nceased benefit accruals effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Corbat\nand Mr. Mason are eligible for benefits under this plan. Their\nentire benefits are cash balance benefits. The Citigroup Pension\nPlan cash balance benefit is expressed as a hypothetical account\nbalance. Prior to January 1, 2008, the plan generally provided\nfor the annual accrual of benefit credits for most of the\ncovered population, including the covered named executive\nofficers, at a rate between 1.5% and 6% of eligible\ncompensation; the benefit credit rate increased with age and\nservice. Eligible compensation generally included base salary\nand incentive awards, but excluded compensation payable after\ntermination of employment, certain non-recurring payments, and\nother benefits. Annual eligible compensation was limited by the\nInternal Revenue Code to $225,000 for 2007 (the final year of\ncash balance benefit accrual). Interest credits continue to be\napplied annually to each participant\u2019s account balance; these\ncredits are based on the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (as\npublished by the Internal Revenue Service). Benefits under The\nCitigroup Pension Plan are payable in annuity form or in other\noptional forms, including a lump sum, upon termination of\nemployment. The Citigroup Pension Plan\u2019s normal retirement age\nis 65. The portion of an eligible participant\u2019s benefit\ndetermined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula may be\npaid upon early retirement, which is defined for this purpose as\nthe first day of the month after the later of the participant\u2019s\n55th birthday or the date on which the participant completes a\nyear of service (as defined in the plan). The Retirement Plan\nfor Specified Non-United States International Staff of Citibank,\nN.A. and Participating Companies (International Staff Plan). The\nInternational Staff Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred\ncompensation plan that was offered to a select group of\nmanagement or highly compensated employees. The International\nStaff Plan provided a retirement benefit to internationally\nmobile staff participating in the Citi Expatriate Program who,\ndue to their mobile status, were ineligible for any other Citi\ndefined benefit retirement plan. Benefits mirrored the Citibank\nRetirement Plan and, after 1999, The Citigroup Pension Plan. The\nInternational Staff Plan closed to new members and generally\nceased benefit accruals effective December 31, 2007, like The\nCitigroup Pension Plan. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  108  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u2019S 2020         \n       EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                   \n                                                                \nMr. Ybarra accrued benefits under the International Staff Plan\nfrom 1994 through 2007. From 1994 through 1999, Mr. Ybarra\naccrued an International Staff Plan benefit determined using the\nCitibank Retirement Plan formula described above, and from 2000\nthrough 2007, Mr. Ybarra accrued an International Staff Plan\nbenefit determined using The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance\nbenefit formula previously described. Limits on eligible\ncompensation and benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code\non tax-qualified retirement plans generally did not apply to\nInternational Staff Plan benefit accruals because the\nInternational Staff Plan is nonqualified; however, the\nInternational Staff Plan was amended over time to include\ncertain limits. Effective January 1, 2000, eligible compensation\nunder the International Staff Plan was limited to $500,000, and\neffective January 1, 2002, the limit on eligible compensation\nimposed by the Internal Revenue Code applied to International\nStaff Plan benefit accruals. Mr. Ybarra is eligible for early\nretirement under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula, meaning\nthat he is eligible for a benefit, actuarially reduced for early\ncommencement, under the International Staff Plan commencing upon\nhis termination of employment. He is eligible for an unreduced\nbenefit commencing immediately if he terminates employment after\nattaining age 60, or, if he terminates employment before age 60,\nhe is eligible for an unreduced benefit commencing at age 65.\nThe International Staff Plan offered lump sum and life annuity\ndistribution options to participants.

The amounts presented above for Mr. Ybarra and   \n       Mr. Whitaker are shown as converted from British pounds  \n       to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2019, conversion     \n       rate used to prepare Citi\u2019s financial statements (1      \n       British pound = 1.36695 U.S. dollars).                   \n       Ms. Fraser will forfeit the unvested portion of her      \n       one-time deferred incentive award granted in 2019 if     \n       she terminates employment prior to the applicable        \n  (3)  vesting dates with Citi for any reason, including death  \n       or disability. Therefore, the value of the one-time      \n       deferred incentive award is not included in the amounts  \n       shown in this table.                                     \n                                                                \nDeferred Stock Awards; Rule of 60. Deferred Stock Awards granted\nto the named executive officers under the 2019 Stock Incentive\nPlan and predecessor plans vest over a period of four or five\nyears subject to performance conditions. Deferred Stock Awards\nprovide for accelerated vesting if a participant dies but\nprovide for vesting on schedule in all other circumstances in\nwhich vesting occurs after termination of employment. If a\nparticipant\u2019s combined years of age and service meet the Rule of\n60 at the time he or she voluntarily resigns, the participant\u2019s\nDeferred Stock Awards will continue to vest on schedule over the\nvesting period, provided he or she does not work for a\n\u201csignificant competitor\u201d during the vesting period. A\nparticipant meets the Rule of 60 if his or her age plus full\nyears of service equals at least 60 and he or she either: (i) is\nat least age 50 with at least five full years of service; or\n(ii) is under age 50 with at least 20 full years of service.\nPartial years of age and service are each rounded down to the\nnearest whole number. In contrast, if a participant does not\nmeet the Rule of 60 and voluntarily resigns, any unvested\nDeferred Stock Awards are forfeited, unless the participant\nbecomes employed in an \u201calternative career.\u201d Under the\n\u201calternative career\u201d provisions of Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards,\nemployees may continue to vest in their deferred awards if they\nresign from Citi to work full-time in government or at a\ncharitable organization or to teach full-time at an educational\ninstitution. All of the named executive officers had attained\nthe Rule of 60 before December 31, 2020, so none of them are\neligible for the \u201calternative career\u201d provisions, and each of\nthem would be eligible for continued vesting following\nresignation without regard to whether they pursued an\n\u201calternative career.\u201d Performance Share Units. Performance Share\nUnits have the same vesting provisions covering termination of\nemployment as those applicable to Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards,\nincluding the Rule of 60. Any named executive officer who meets\nthe Rule of 60 will receive his or her earned Performance Share\nUnits unless: (i) he or she voluntarily resigns during the\nperformance period and performs services for a competitor, or\n(ii) he or she is terminated for gross misconduct (in which case\nthe undelivered award is cancelled). If a named executive\nofficer who meets the Rule of 60 resigns and competes, at the\nend of the performance period, he or she will forfeit a prorated\nPerformance Share Unit award, based on his or her service during\nthe performance period. For example, if such a named executive\nofficer resigns after the first year of the performance period\nto work for a competitor, he or she will receive one-third of\nthe earned Performance Share Units after the end of the three-\nyear performance period and the other two-thirds will be\nforfeited. Deferred Cash Awards . Deferred Cash Awards have the\nsame vesting provisions covering termination of employment as\nthose applicable to Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards, including the\nRule of 60. \u201cDouble Trigger\u201d Change of Control Requirement.\nCiti\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and its predecessor, the 2014\nStock Incentive Plan, have a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d requirement, which\nprovides that an involuntary termination of employment not for\ngross misconduct must occur as a result of a \u201cchange of control\u201d\nof Citi before any vesting of equity awards may occur in\nconnection with the change of control. In addition, the\nCompensation Committee has a policy that equity awards granted\nto executive officers will not be accelerated solely by reason\nof a change of control of Citigroup Inc. The intent of the\npolicy is for such a change of control to have no impact on the\napplicable awards, absent a qualifying termination of\nemployment. The same change of control provisions apply to\nCiti\u2019s Performance Share Units and Deferred Cash Awards.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  110  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE CITI\u0092S 2020          \n       EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                   \n                                                                \nUnder the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, a \u0093change of control\u0094\nmeans: (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial\nownership of Citigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more\nof the combined voting power of then outstanding securities of\nCitigroup Inc.; (ii) specified changes in the majority of the\nBoard (not including the election of Directors whose election or\nnomination was approved by a majority of the then incumbent\nBoard); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of Citigroup Inc. or a\ndissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or (iv)\nconsummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or\nother corporate transaction that results in stockholders of\nCitigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting\npower of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation resulting from the\ntransaction.

Management Analysis of Potential Adverse Effects of\nCompensation Plans Citi has adopted multiple coordinated\nstrategies to manage the risk of material adverse effects to the\nfranchise through the design and administration of its incentive\ncompensation programs, including those applicable to the named\nexecutive officers. Those strategies, including regular analyses\nand reviews by Citi\u0092s Chief Risk Officer, are detailed on pages\n87-88 of this Proxy Statement. On the basis of the foregoing\nanalysis, management has concluded that Citi\u0092s compensation\nplans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on Citi.

When determining our midpoint, we    \n  \u25cf  considered compensation of 210,152 Citi employees (other   \n     than the CEO) who were employed by Citi on December 31,    \n     2020, in about 100 countries. We did not exclude any       \n     countries and we did not make any adjustments for the      \n     cost of living.                                            \n     SEC regulations allow employers to identify the midpoint   \n     based on a \u0093consistently applied compensation measure\u0094       \n     (CACM). We used 2020 base pay and cash payments under our  \n  \u25cf  incentive compensation plans as our CACM to determine the  \n     midpoint of our employee population. We chose this CACM    \n     because these two pay elements were consistently           \n     available across all countries in which we have            \n     employees.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Where full year information from our formulaic incentive   \n     compensation plans was not available, we estimated such    \n     amounts using third quarter payments as a proxy for        \n  \u27a2  fourth quarter payments, consistent with the design of     \n     the plans and our experience with the data. The incentive  \n     compensation plans for Citi employees with compensation    \n     in the range of our midpoint generally have quarterly      \n     payment schedules.                                         \n  \u27a2  Compensation paid in foreign currency was converted to     \n     U.S. dollars using a monthly average.                      \n     We did not consider discretionary cash incentives, equity  \n     awards, or deferred cash awards as part of the analysis    \n     because all employees eligible for discretionary           \n  \u27a2  incentives, equity awards, or deferred cash awards are     \n     paid well above our midpoint, and therefore, including or  \n     excluding such compensation would not affect our           \n     midpoint.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     We then calculated the 2020 \u0093annual total compensation\u0094 for  \n     a group of representative employees with compensation at   \n     or very near our 2020 midpoint (our \u0093midpoint group\u0094). We    \n  \u25cf  used the 2020 annual total compensation of the employee    \n     with 2020 annual total compensation at approximately the   \n     median of our midpoint group to determine our CEO pay      \n     ratio.                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     In determining the \u0093annual total compensation\u0094 for each      \n     employee in our midpoint group, we followed the            \n     methodology required under SEC regulations for             \n     calculating the total compensation of our named executive  \n  \u27a2  officers as reported in the Summary Compensation Table,    \n     and, as permitted under the SEC regulations, added the     \n     value of employer contributions to broad-based employee    \n     benefit plans not already included in the Summary          \n     Compensation Table.                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The SEC rules for identifying the median-paid employee     \n     and calculating the CEO pay ratio allow companies to       \n  \u25cf  apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as a      \n     result, the CEO pay ratio reported by Citi may not be      \n     comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other          \n     companies.                                                 \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n       \n  113  \n       \nProposal 4: Approval of Additional Authorized Shares under the\nCitigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan On the recommendation of the\nCompensation Committee, the Board has unanimously approved an\namendment to the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2019\nPlan).

Citi\u2019s equity awards are a key component of     \n     annual incentive awards for thousands of employees         \n  \u25cf  worldwide, thereby aligning the interests of stockholders  \n     and a broader group of Citi employees (not just senior     \n     executives). In 2021, approximately 8,215 employees in 60  \n     countries received equity awards under the 2019 Plan as    \n     part of their annual incentive awards.                     \n  \u25cf  Citi has prudent equity award practices.                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Our equity pay mix minimizes dilution from our executive   \n     compensation programs. Under our generally applicable      \n     approach to annual executive compensation, 50% of the      \n     deferred portion of named executive officer incentive      \n     compensation is payable in deferred stock awards, and 50%  \n     is payable in performance share units that have            \n     performance-based vesting features and are settled in      \n     cash with a value linked to the value of Citi common       \n     stock. This practice links named executive officer         \n     deferred compensation to the value of Citi common stock,   \n     yet will limit the use of shares under the 2019 Plan.      \n     All deferred equity awards have clawbacks. Citi\u2019s equity   \n     awards are subject to one or more clawbacks that provide   \n     for cancellation in a range of circumstances, as set       \n     forth on page 88 of this Proxy Statement.                  \n     Stock ownership requirements. Executive officers are       \n     generally required to hold at least 75% of the net         \n     after-tax shares acquired through Citi\u2019s incentive         \n     compensation programs as long as they are executive        \n     officers. In addition to that stock ownership commitment,  \n     effective January 1, 2013, executive officers are          \n     required to retain at least 50% of the shares subject to   \n     the stock ownership commitment for one year after ceasing  \n     to be an executive officer, as a result of leaving Citi    \n     employment or otherwise.                                   \n     Share buybacks have the incidental effect of offsetting    \n     dilution from equity compensation programs. In the first   \n     quarter of 2020, Citi continued the return of capital to   \n     stockholders through common stock repurchases and          \n     dividends.

Regulatory guidance in the U.S.    \n     and in other countries in which Citi does business         \n  \u25cf  provides that a substantial portion of variable            \n     compensation awarded to senior executives and other        \n     employees whose actions have a material impact on the      \n     risk exposure of Citi should be awarded in shares.         \n                                                                \nOverhang Table \u201cOverhang\u201d refers to the potential stockholder\ndilution represented by outstanding employee equity awards and\nshares available for future grants.\n                                                                \n                        December 31, 2020(1)    April 27, 2021  \n                                                (estimated)(2)  \n  Simple overhang(3)    3.01%                   3.96%           \n  Fully diluted         2.92%                   3.81%           \n  overhang(4)                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       The following data as of December 31, 2020, was used in  \n       the calculation of overhang percentages: outstanding     \n       equity awards under the 2019 Plan and its predecessor    \n  (1)  plans (unvested stock awards of 28.38 million and        \n       unexercised stock options of 0.17 million, totaling      \n       28.55 million shares); shares available for grant under  \n       the 2019 Plan (34.02 million); and common shares         \n       outstanding (2,082.1 million).                           \n       Our overhang estimates at April 27, 2021, are based on   \n       the assumptions that the number of shares subject to     \n       outstanding awards on that date is the same as the       \n       number outstanding on December 31, 2021, and Proposal 4  \n  (2)  is approved by stockholders such that 54.02 million      \n       shares will be available for future grants under the     \n       2019 Plan. For purpose of this estimate, we have used    \n       the common shares outstanding as of the record date,     \n       which was 2,086.7 million.                               \n       Simple overhang is the sum of outstanding equity awards  \n  (3)  and shares available for grant under the applicable      \n       plan stated as a percentage of common shares             \n       outstanding.                                             \n       Fully diluted overhang is the sum of outstanding equity  \n       awards and shares available for grant under the          \n  (4)  applicable plan stated as a percentage of fully diluted  \n       common shares (i.e., common shares outstanding plus      \n       outstanding equity awards and shares available for       \n       grant under the applicable plan).                        \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                        \n  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED         \n  SHARES UNDER THE CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE  115  \n  PLAN                                                  \n                                                        \nRun Rate Table Our run rate is the number of shares subject to\nequity awards granted during a year stated as a percentage of\ncommon shares outstanding for such year, based on annual grant\ndata and the basic weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding as reported in Citigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for such year.\n                                                                \n  Run rates for                                     Three-year  \n  12-month periods       2018     2019     2020     average     \n  ending December 31     0.52%    0.66%    0.59%    0.59%       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \nThe preceding Overhang Table and Run Rate Table demonstrate our\nprudent use of shares.

The 2019 Plan has a fixed number   \n  \u25cf  of shares available for grant that will not automatically  \n     increase because of an \u201cevergreen\u201d feature.                \n     Minimum one-year vesting requirement. Our one-year         \n  \u25cf  minimum vesting requirement will generally apply to at     \n     least 95% of the shares that may be granted pursuant to    \n     any type of award.                                         \n     A\u00a0limit on total annual compensation for Directors. The    \n     maximum number of shares subject to awards to an           \n     individual Director in a calendar year, taken together     \n  \u25cf  with any cash fees paid during the calendar year to the    \n     Director for services as a member of the Board, may not    \n     exceed $1 million in value, except where the Board of      \n     Directors approves a higher limit for a non-executive      \n     Board chair.                                               \n     Annual limits on shares and options or SARs that can be    \n     granted to individual employees. The 2019 Plan limits the  \n     number of shares subject to stock options and SARs that    \n  \u25cf  may be granted in a calendar year to an individual         \n     employee to one million shares. Separately, the 2019 Plan  \n     limits the number of shares subject to stock awards that   \n     may be granted in a calendar year to an individual         \n     employee to one million shares.                            \n     No discounted options or SARs. Option or SAR exercise      \n  \u25cf  prices must be at least 100% of fair market value on the   \n     date an option or SAR is granted.                          \n     No repricings or cash buyouts. The 2019 Plan prohibits     \n     any \u201crepricing\u201d of any outstanding option or SAR, except   \n     with the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The  \n     2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d to mean (i) any action that  \n     constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d under GAAP or the rules of the   \n     NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an        \n     outstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing  \n  \u25cf  its exercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an           \n     outstanding option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds  \n     its fair market value in exchange for cash; (iii) any      \n     cancellation of an option or SAR in exchange for a new     \n     option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a       \n     substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when    \n     its exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each      \n     case other than a permitted equitable adjustment.          \n     No reload option grants. Reload options are additional     \n  \u25cf  options that are granted automatically upon the exercise   \n     of previously granted options; options granted under the   \n     2019 Plan may not include a reload feature.                \n     No liberal share \u201crecycling.\u201d If an award under the 2019   \n     Plan, or, after April 16, 2019 (the effective date of the  \n     2019 Plan), the 2014 Plan and the 2009 Stock Incentive     \n     Plan (the 2009 Plan), is forfeited, cancelled, or expires  \n     or is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares   \n     subject to such award will be available for future grants  \n  \u25cf  under the 2019 Plan. However, the 2019 Plan prohibits      \n     re-granting shares withheld or tendered to pay option      \n     exercise prices, repurchased by the Company with option    \n     exercise proceeds, or withheld or tendered to satisfy tax  \n     withholding obligations on any award. Also, shares of      \n     stock subject to SARs that are not issued on settlement    \n     may not be re-granted.                                     \n     No dividend or dividend equivalent payments on unvested    \n     shares subject to a performance vesting condition. The     \n     2019 Plan permits payment of dividends or dividend         \n     equivalents on shares of restricted or deferred stock      \n  \u25cf  subject to a performance vesting condition only if and     \n     when the underlying shares vest. The 2019 Plan also        \n     prohibits the payment of dividends and dividend            \n     equivalents on shares subject to outstanding options and   \n     SARs.                                                      \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  116  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED SHARES     \n       UNDER THE CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     A \u201cdouble trigger\u201d change of control provision.

The 2019 Plan does not provide    \n  \u25cf  for excise tax gross-ups in the event of a change of       \n     control of Citigroup Inc., nor do any executive            \n     agreements.                                                \n     No liberal definition of change of control. Our            \n     definition of \u201cchange of control\u201d of Citigroup Inc.        \n     requires the consummation, and not merely the approval,    \n     of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other       \n     corporate transaction that results in stockholders of      \n     Citigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined    \n     voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation        \n     resulting from such transaction.

If Proposal 4 is\napproved by stockholders at our Annual Meeting, we intend to\nfile a registration statement on Form S-8, pursuant to the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, to register the additional\nshares authorized for grant under the 2019 Plan. General. The\n2019 Plan became effective on April 16, 2019 and will expire on\nthe date of the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in\n2024. The 2019 Plan provides for various types of awards\ndenominated in shares of Citi common stock to Citi employees,\nofficers, and non-employee Directors. The NYSE closing price of\na share of Citi common stock on March 8, 2021 was $72.22.\nAdministration. The 2019 Plan is administered by the\nCompensation Committee. All members of such Committee or a sub-\ncommittee thereof must satisfy the requirements for independence\nof SEC Rule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside\nDirectors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board. The\nCompensation Committee may delegate some or all of its authority\nover administration of the 2019 Plan to one or more officers,\ndirectors, employees, or another plan administrator except with\nrespect to persons who are Section 16(a) officers. In addition,\nany special terms or conditions that the Compensation Committee\nconsiders necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in\nnon-U.S. law, tax policy or custom may be included in a sub-plan\nthat forms a part of the 2019 Plan. Eligibility. All \u201cemployees\u201d\nof Citi\u2014within the broad definition set forth in the\ninstructions to the SEC Form S-8 registration statement, as in\neffect on April 16, 2019, but expressly excluding consultants\nand advisors who are not members of the Board\u2014generally are\neligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. Based on\nworldwide employment at December 31, 2019, approximately 210,000\npersons could be eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan.\nHowever, participation is discretionary\u2014awards are subject to\napproval by the Compensation Committee. In general, employees\nwith discretionary annual incentive awards of at least $100,000\nare eligible to receive at least 25% of that annual award in\ndeferred stock. In 2020 through March 1, 2021, awards were made\nunder the 2019 Plan to 16 non-employee Directors, 21 executive\nofficers, and approximately 8,215 employees worldwide. Former\n\u201cemployees\u201d are eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, but\nonly with respect to their last year of service or substitute\nawards to replace awards granted by a prior employer acquired by\nthe Company. Shares subject to the 2019 Plan. Shares of Citi\ncommon stock issued in connection with awards under the 2019\nPlan may be shares that are authorized but unissued, or\npreviously issued shares that have been reacquired, or both. The\ninitial share authorization under the 2019 Plan was 30 million\nshares. Pursuant to the amendment approved at the 2020 Annual\nMeeting, the number of authorized shares increased by 15\nmillion. Pursuant to the amendment described in Proposal 4, the\nnumber of authorized shares would increase by 20 million.\n\u201cRecycling\u201d provisions. If an award under the 2019 Plan, or,\nafter April 16, 2019 (the effective date of the 2019 Plan), the\n2014 Plan and the 2009 Plan, is forfeited, cancelled, or expires\nor is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject\nto such award will be available for future grants under the 2019\nPlan. However, shares tendered by a participant or withheld by\nCiti to pay an option exercise price, withheld or tendered to\nsatisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any award,\nrepurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds, covered by a\nstock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of shares\nactually issued upon exercise) or withheld to satisfy any debt\nor other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled fractional\nshares will be considered issued and shall not be added to the\nmaximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2019 Plan.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  118  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED SHARES     \n       UNDER THE CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN            \n                                                                \nLimits on awards. The maximum number of shares subject to awards\nto an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards\nmade at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash\nretainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the\ncalendar year to the Director, in respect of the Director\u2019s\nservice as a member of the Board during such year (including\nservice as a member or chair of any committees of the Board),\nmay not exceed $1 million in value, as determined as of the date\nof each award. However, the independent members of the Board may\nmake exceptions to this limit for a non-executive chair of the\nBoard, provided that the Director receiving any additional\ncompensation may not participate in the decision to award such\ncompensation. For all other eligible \u201cemployees,\u201d the number of\nshares subject to stock options or SARs granted during a\ncalendar year may not exceed one million shares, and the number\nof shares that may be subject to stock awards granted in a\ncalendar year may not exceed one million shares, unless granted\nsubject to substitute awards that replace awards of a former\nemployer acquired by the Company. Types of awards. The following\ntypes of awards may be made under the 2019 Plan:\n                                                                \n     Stock options. An award of a stock option under the 2019   \n     Plan grants a participant the right to purchase a          \n     specified number of shares of Citi common stock during a   \n  \u25cf  specified term in the future at an exercise price equal    \n     to at least 100% of the \u201cfair market value\u201d (see below)    \n     of Citi common stock on the grant date. The term of a      \n     stock option may not exceed 10 years from the date of      \n     grant.                                                     \n     Stock appreciation rights (SARs). A SAR, upon exercise,    \n     entitles the participant to receive an amount equal to     \n     the difference between the fair market value of Citi       \n     common stock on the exercise date and the exercise price   \n     of the SAR (which may not be less than 100% of fair        \n  \u25cf  market value of a share of Citi common stock on the grant  \n     date) times the number of shares subject to the SAR.       \n     Payment to a participant upon the exercise of a SAR may    \n     be in cash and/or shares of Citi common stock. The term    \n     of a SAR may not exceed 10 years from the date of the      \n     grant.                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     For purposes of setting the exercise price of any option   \n     or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, \u201cfair market value\u201d    \n     means the closing price on the NYSE (or on the principal   \n  \u27a2  national securities exchange on which the common stock is  \n     traded or quoted, if not the NYSE) on the date on which    \n     the stock option or SAR is granted. For all other          \n     purposes under the 2019 Plan, \u201cfair market value\u201d will be  \n     as determined by the Compensation Committee.               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  Stock payment. The Compensation Committee may grant        \n     vested shares of Citi common stock as a stock payment.     \n     Restricted stock. A restricted stock award is an award of  \n     outstanding shares of Citi common stock that does not      \n     vest until vesting conditions are satisfied and which      \n     will be forfeited if conditions to vesting are not met.    \n     Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise,    \n     participants who receive awards of restricted stock are    \n     also generally entitled to direct the voting of the        \n     unvested shares underlying their awards on matters         \n     submitted to a vote of stockholders. All shares            \n  \u25cf  underlying outstanding (unvested) restricted stock awards  \n     as to which no voting instructions are received are voted  \n     proportionately, based on the voting instructions          \n     received with respect to all other restricted shares.      \n     Participants may receive dividends on the shares subject   \n     to their awards during the vesting period, unless the      \n     awards are subject to one or more performance conditions,  \n     in which case the dividends, if any, shall be paid only    \n     if and when, and only to the extent that, the underlying   \n     shares vest.                                               \n     Deferred stock. A deferred stock award is an unfunded,     \n     unsecured promise to deliver shares of Citi common stock   \n     to the participant in the future, if the participant       \n     satisfies the conditions to vesting. Participants do not   \n     have voting rights (their rights are no greater than a     \n  \u25cf  general unsecured creditor of the Company), but may        \n     receive dividend equivalent payments during the vesting    \n     period, unless the awards are subject to one or more       \n     performance conditions, in which case the dividend         \n     equivalents, if any, shall be paid to participants only    \n     if and when, and only to the extent that, the underlying   \n     shares vest.                                               \n     Other stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee may   \n     grant any other award that is denominated in shares of     \n     Citi common stock and that may be settled by the delivery  \n  \u25cf  of shares and/or cash. For the avoidance of doubt, awards  \n     that by their terms shall be settled only in cash shall    \n     not be considered to have been granted under the 2019      \n     Plan.                                                      \n     Performance-based awards. Subject to the terms of the      \n     2019 Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant awards     \n  \u25cf  that are subject to one or more performance conditions     \n     related to a performance period of not less than one       \n     year.                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                        \n  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED         \n  SHARES UNDER THE CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE  119  \n  PLAN                                                  \n                                                        \nMinimum vesting requirement. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan\nmay not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on\nwhich the award is granted, except that the Compensation\nCommittee may grant awards that vest in less than a year (i) as\na \u0093substitute award\u0094 to replace awards of a former employer\nacquired by the Company, (ii) awards to Directors that vest on\nthe earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and\nthe next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50\nweeks after the immediately preceding year\u0092s annual meeting, and\n(iii) any additional awards the Compensation Committee may\ngrant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available\nshare reserve authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan. This\nrestriction does not apply to the Compensation Committee\u0092s\ndiscretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting\nof any award, including in cases of retirement, death,\ndisability, leave of absence, termination of employment, change\nof control, or upon the sale or other disposition of the\nsubsidiary employing a participant or other similar event.\nPerformance conditions. In the case of an award subject to a\nperformance condition, the applicable performance condition may\ninclude one or more of the following performance conditions and\nbe expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or\nrelative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product\ngrowth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per\nshare, stockholders\u0092 equity or return on stockholders\u0092 equity,\nassets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets,\ncapital or return on capital, return on risk capital, book value\nor book value per share, economic value-added models or\nequivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income,\nexpenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash\nflow per share, stock price, total shareholder return, market\nshare, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency\nratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory\nachievements, or any objective or subjective performance\nconditions selected by the Compensation Committee. Prohibition\nagainst repricing. The 2019 Plan prohibits any action under the\n2019 Plan that would constitute a \u0094repricing\u0094 of any outstanding\noption or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, the 2014 Plan, the\n2009 Plan or any other plan of the Company or of any acquired\ncompany, except with the approval of the stockholders of the\nCompany. The 2019 Plan defines \u0093repricing\u0094 to mean: (i) any\naction that constitutes a \u0093repricing\u0094 under GAAP or the rules of\nthe NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an\noutstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its\nexercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option\nor SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in\nexchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in\nexchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or\n(iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when\nits exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each case other\nthan a permitted equitable adjustment. Prohibition of reload\noptions. The 2019 Plan does not permit the grant of \u0093reload\u0094\noptions. Repayment obligation; right of set-off. If the\nCompensation Committee subsequently determines that all\nconditions to vesting and payment of an award, or the vesting\nand exercisability of an option or SAR, were not satisfied in\nfull, the Compensation Committee may cancel such vesting or\nexercise and refuse to issue shares and immediately terminate\nthe participant\u0092s rights with respect to such award (or\nimproperly vested portion thereof). If the vesting or exercise\nof any such award (or portion thereof) has already been settled\nby delivery of shares or cash, the participant shall be\nobligated, upon demand, to return the shares or cash (or higher\nvalue received at vesting or exercise), to Citi, without\nreduction for any shares or cash withheld to satisfy withholding\ntax or other obligations. Consistent with the requirements of\nSection 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2019 Plan also\nprovides for the set-off of vested awards against obligations a\nparticipant may owe to Citi, including but not limited to the\nobligation to repay improperly vested or exercised awards. Any\nfailure to timely pay tax-related obligations owed to Citi in\nconnection with an award may result in its cancellation. Non-\ntransferability. During the vesting period, awards and sale-\nrestricted shares generally are not transferable other than by\nwill or the laws of descent and distribution. www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  120  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED SHARES     \n       UNDER THE CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN            \n                                                                \nAdjustments. The 2019 Plan provides that the Compensation\nCommittee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the\nmaximum number of shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan\nand to the annual individual award limits expressed in numbers\nof shares in the event of any changes to the Company\u0092s capital\nstructure, including a change in the number of shares\noutstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock split,\nreverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity\nrestructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity\nsecurities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,\nreorganization, or similar transaction. In the event of any such\ntransaction, or any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or\nother distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of\nassets to stockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make\nappropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of\nshares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise prices of\noutstanding options and SARs, and performance conditions, to the\nextent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of\nparticipants\u0092 rights. Change of control. The Compensation\nCommittee may, when an award is made, or at any time prior to,\nat, or after the time of a \u0093change of control\u0094 (as defined\nbelow), provide for the adjustment of performance conditions to\nreflect the change of control, provide for the cancellation of\noutstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring entity\n(or the surviving or acquiring entity\u0092s parent company) replaces\nthe awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value,\nprovide for the acceleration of any time periods or the waiver\nof any other conditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or\ndistribution of an award upon an involuntary termination of a\nparticipant\u0092s employment as a result of a change of control, or\nprovide for the purchase of any award. The vesting, payment,\npurchase, or distribution of an award, however, may not be\naccelerated by reason of a change of control for any participant\nunless the participant\u0092s employment is involuntarily terminated\nas a result of the change of control. For these purposes, a\ntermination of employment as a result of a change of control\nmeans involuntary termination of employment other than for\n\u0093gross misconduct\u0094 (as defined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on or\nprior to the first anniversary of, the change of control. The\n2019 Plan defines a \u0093change of control\u0094 to mean (i) a person\nacquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup\nInc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting\npower of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii)\nspecified changes in the majority of the Board (not including\nthe election of Directors whose election or nomination was\napproved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a\nsale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of\nthe assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of\nCitigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization,\nmerger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that\nresults in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than\n50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other\ncorporation resulting from the transaction. Tax withholding.\nCiti retains the right to deduct or withhold, or require the\nparticipant to remit to his or her employer, an amount\nsufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign taxes\n(including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-equalized\nexpatriates) required by law or regulation to be withheld with\nrespect to any taxable event as a result of the 2019 Plan.\nAmendment and termination. The 2019 Plan may be amended,\nsuspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any\ntime, provided that no amendment shall be made without\nstockholder approval if it would materially increase the number\nof shares available under the 2019 Plan (other than in\nconnection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the\ntypes of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the class of\npersons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially\nextend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method\nof determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted\nunder the 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against\n\u0093repricing,\u0094 or otherwise require approval by stockholders in\norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or\nprincipal national securities exchange upon which Citi\u0092s common\nstock is traded or quoted). Award modification. The Compensation\nCommittee retains the right to modify outstanding awards without\na participant\u0092s prior consent if it determines that the\nmodification is required to comply with applicable law,\nregulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax\nlaw). Subject to certain exceptions, any other modifications, if\nadverse to a participant, shall not be effective without the\nparticipant\u0092s written consent.

This\nsummary does not constitute tax advice and, among other things,\ndoes not describe state, local, or foreign tax consequences,\nwhich may be substantially different. Generally, a participant\nwill not recognize taxable income on the grant of a stock\noption. Upon the exercise of a stock option, a participant will\nrecognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the fair market value of the Citi common stock received\non the date of exercise and the option cost (number of shares\npurchased multiplied by the exercise price per share). The\nparticipant will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of\nthe option even though the shares acquired may be subject to\nfurther restrictions on sale or transferability. Citi will\nordinarily be entitled to a deduction on the exercise date in an\namount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the\nparticipant upon exercise, except as may be specified under\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, upon a\nsubsequent sale of shares acquired in an option exercise, the\ndifference between the sale proceeds and the cost basis of the\nshares sold will be taxable as a capital gain or loss, including\nany sale of shares freed from sale restrictions to fund the\npayment of taxes incurred at exercise. The 2019 Plan does not\nprovide for awards of \u0093incentive stock options,\u0094 which have\ndifferent tax consequences under the Internal Revenue Code.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n       \n  122  \n       \nStockholder Proposals Citi makes every effort to be responsive\nto concerns expressed by our stockholders by engaging in\ndialogues, participating in issuer/investor working groups, and\nadopting policies or initiatives we believe to be in the best\ninterests of all stockholders. Over the years, Citi has met with\nseveral proponents and other interested parties regarding such\nissues as gender pay equity, proxy access, human rights, climate\nchange, racial equity, culture, risk management, auditor\nrotation, and trade association payments, among others, and has,\non certain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in response\nto these engagements and/or stockholder votes. For example, in\n2019, Citi\u2019s Board of Directors lowered the Special Meeting\nthreshold in response to the stockholder vote at the 2019 Annual\nMeeting. We encourage our stockholders to communicate with\nmanagement and the Board. Any stockholder wishing to communicate\nwith management, the Board, or an individual Director, or obtain\nthe addresses of any of the stockholder proponents or their Citi\nstock ownership information, should send a request to the\nCorporate Secretary, Rohan Weerasinghe, at 388 Greenwich Street,\nNew York, New York 10013. Proposal 5 John Chevedden has\nsubmitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2021\nAnnual Meeting. Proposal 5 \u2014 Improve Our Catch-22 Proxy Access\nShareholders request that our board of directors take the steps\nnecessary to enable as many shareholders as may be needed to\naggregate their shares to equal 3% of our stock owned\ncontinuously for 3-years in order to enable shareholder proxy\naccess. The current arbitrary maximum quota of 20 shareholders\nto initiate shareholder proxy access can be called Catch-22\nProxy Access. In order to assemble a group of 20 shareholders,\nwho have owned 3% of the stock for an unbroken 3-years, one\nwould reasonably need to start with about 60 shareholders who\nown 9% of company stock for an unbroken 3-years because\ninitiating proxy access is a complicated process that is easily\nsusceptible to errors. The 60 shareholders could then be\nwhittled down to 40 shareholders because some shareholders would\nbe unable to timely meet all the paper chase requirements. After\nthe 40 shareholders submit their paperwork to management \u2014 then\nmanagement might arbitrarily claim that 10 shareholders do not\nmeet the requirements and management might convince another 10\nshareholders to withdraw - leaving 20 shareholders. But the\ncurrent rule does not allow 40 shareholders to submit their\npaperwork to management to end up with 20 qualified\nshareholders. And 60 shareholders who own 9% of company stock\nfor an unbroken 3-years might determine that they own 51% of\ncompany stock when length of unbroken stock ownership is\nfactored out. Plus it would be easier to simply call for a\nspecial shareholder meeting because 15% of shares can call for a\nspecial meeting and there is no 3-year unbroken stock ownership\nneeded to qualify. But how does one begin to assemble a group of\n60 potential participants if potential participants cannot be\nguaranteed participant status after following the tedious rules\nthat can easily be 1500-words of legalese \u2014 because they could\nbe voted off the island after a substantial investment of time\nby the arbitrary quota of 20 shareholders. Who would be voted\noff the island? Would one favor shareholders who own the most\nstock or shareholders who have the best access to expert advice\non the complicated workings of shareholder proxy access or\nshareholders who could attract the best proxy access candidates\nor the shareholders who can attract the most votes to the proxy\naccess candidates? The current arbitrary limit of 20\nshareholders to initiate shareholder proxy access means that\nshareholders of the same class of stock are treated unequally.\nThis could be in violation of state law. At least one court\nconcluded that a company cannot provide for different voting\nrights as among the holders of the same class of stock.

Please\nvote yes: Improve Our Catch-22 Proxy Access \u2014 Proposal 5\nManagement Comment Summary Citi implemented a progressive proxy\naccess by-law provision for our stockholders that is aligned\nwith current best practices, providing stockholders with\nmeaningful and appropriate proxy access rights while taking into\naccount the need to balance enhancing stockholder rights with\nprotecting the interests of all our stockholders. The Board\nadopted the proxy access by-law provision after careful\nconsideration and engagement with a number of our stockholders.\nSince our adoption of proxy access, we have had further\ndiscussions regarding proxy access with stockholders. Based on\ntheir feedback as well as a benchmarking review of proxy access\nrights adopted by other companies, we continue to believe that\nour current proxy access structure is the most appropriate for\nthe Company and its stockholders at this time. Important Points\nto Consider\n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s Proxy Access By-law is within the mainstream of     \n     other significant U.S. public companies with               \n     proxy access rights. Specifically, our By-laws permit a    \n     stockholder, or a group of up to twenty                    \n     stockholders, owning at least three percent of Citi\u2019s      \n     outstanding shares of common stock                         \n     continuously for at least three years, to nominate and     \n     include in our annual meeting proxy                        \n     materials director nominees constituting twenty percent    \n     of the Board (but no fewer than two                        \n     nominees), subject to the other procedural requirements    \n     specified in our By-laws. In fact, all of                  \n     the provisions sought by the Proponent, except for the     \n     provision permitting an unlimited number of                \n     stockholders to aggregate their holdings to nominate       \n     candidates, are already included in Citi\u2019s                 \n     Proxy Access Bylaw. A recent study published by Sidley     \n     Austin LLP in 2020 summarizes proxy access                 \n     provisions adopted since January 1, 2015 and, after        \n     analyzing proxy access provisions, concluded               \n     that a nominating group size limit of 20 is by far the     \n     most common (602 out of 644 companies (93%))               \n     of the companies surveyed.1 Citi\u2019s Proxy Access            \n     provisions, including its group aggregation limit,         \n  \u27a2  are in line with best practices among U.S. corporations.   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n     The Proposal requests the following change to Citi\u2019s       \n     Proxy Access By-law: no limitation on the number of        \n     stockholders that can aggregate their shares to achieve    \n  \u27a2  the 3% of common stock required to nominate directors.     \n     Management believes that the change put forth in the       \n     Proposal is not in the best interests of Citi\u2019s            \n     stockholders.                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Allowing a limited number of holders, who own a            \n     meaningful interest in the Company for a reasonable        \n     period of time, to act as a group strengthens the          \n     principle that we believe is shared by most of our         \n  \u2713  stockholders \u2013 the right to nominate a director using the  \n     Company\u2019s proxy statement should be available only for     \n     those who have a sufficient financial stake in the         \n     Company to cause their interests to be aligned with the    \n     interests of our stockholders.                             \n     The existing limit on the number of holders who can        \n     aggregate their shares creates a reasonable limitation     \n     that will control the administrative costs for Citi. In    \n     the absence of a reasonable limitation, or as the          \n  \u2713  proposal requests \u2013 no limitation - on the number of       \n     stockholders in a group, Citi could be required to make    \n     burdensome and time-consuming inquiries into the nature    \n     and duration of the share ownership of a large number of   \n     individuals.                                               \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Because Citi has adopted progressive proxy access   \n  by-law provisions that serve the best interests of  \n  the Company and our stockholders and are in line    \n  with best practices among Citi\u2019s peers and the      \n  vast majority of large cap companies, adoption of   \n  the stockholder proposal is not necessary or        \n  appropriate; therefore the Board recommends a vote  \n  AGAINST this Proposal 5.                            \n                                                      \n                                                                \n     Sidley Austin LLP, Proxy Access: A Five-Year Review,       \n  1  January 16, 2020.                                          \n     https://www.sidley.com/-/media/update-pdfs/2020/01/proxy\u2026  \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  124  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nProposal 6 Kenneth Steiner has submitted the following proposal\nfor consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting. Proposal 6 \u2014\nIndependent Board Chairman The shareholders request the Board of\nDirectors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary,\nto require the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever\npossible, to be an independent member of the Board. This policy\ncould be phased in for the next CEO transition. If the Board\ndetermines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no\nlonger independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who\nsatisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable\namount of time. Compliance with this policy is temporarily\nwaived if in the unlikely event no independent director is\navailable and willing to serve as Chair. This proposal topic won\n52% support at Boeing and 54% support at Baxter International in\n2020. Support for this proposal topic jumped from 34% to 52% in\none year at Boeing. Citigroup stock is down from $79 in late\n2019. Support for this proposal topic received 17% higher\nsupport at U.S. companies in 2020. Since management performance\nsetbacks often result in higher support for this proposal topic,\nthe mere submission of this proposal may be an incentive for our\nChairman of the Board to perform better leading up to the 2021\nannual meeting.\n                                                                \n  \u25cf  The role of the CEO and management is to run the company.  \n  \u25cf  The role of the Board of Directors is to provide           \n     independent oversight of management and the CEO.           \n  \u25cf  There is a potential conflict of interest for a CEO to     \n     have the oversight role of Chairman.                       \n                                                                \nAs Andrew Grove, Intel\u2019s former chair, stated, \u201cThe separation\nof the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a\ncorporation. Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO\nan employee? If he\u2019s an employee, he needs a boss. and that boss\nis the Board. The Chairman runs the Board. How can the CEO be\nhis own boss?\u201d Shareholders are best served by an independent\nBoard Chair who can provide a balance of power between the CEO\nand the Board. The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to\noversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. A\nCEO serving as Chair can result in excessive management\ninfluence on the Board and weaker oversight of management. We\nurge the Board to take the opportunity to appoint a new\nindependent Board Chair. It is also important to have an\nindependent board chairman to help make up for the 2020\ndevaluation of shareholder meetings with the widespread\nsubstitution of online shareholder meetings using the pandemic\nas an easy steppingstone. Online meetings, which are a\nshareholder engagement and shareholder outreach wasteland, are\nso easy for management that management will never want to return\nto in-person shareholder meetings. With tightly controlled\nonline shareholder meetings everything is optional. For instance\nmanagement reporting on the status of the company is optional.\nAlso answers to questions are optional even if management\nmisleadingly asks for questions. Please vote yes: Independent\nBoard Chairman \u2014 Proposal 6 Citi 2021 Proxy Statement Table of\nContents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  125  \n                              \nManagement Comment Summary Since 2009, Citi has had an\nindependent Chair separate from the CEO. The Board firmly\nsupports having an independent Director in a Board leadership\nposition at all times. As such, Citi\u2019s Board, on December 15,\n2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if Citi\ndoes not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect an\nindependent Lead Director having similar duties to an\nindependent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of\nthe non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Board has\ndetermined that the current structure, an independent Chair\nseparate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this\ntime, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be an\nindependent Director in a Board leadership position. Since\nCiti\u2019s Board has adopted a framework that provides for either an\nindependent Chair or an independent Lead Director, the Board\nbelieves that this Proposal is not necessary. Important Points\nto Consider\n                                                                \n     As required by Citi\u2019s By-Laws, the Board elects its        \n     Chairman annually, and, for each of the last 11 years,     \n     the Board has elected an independent director to serve as  \n     Board Chair. Citi\u2019s By-laws ensure that there will be an   \n     independent member of the Board in a leadership position   \n     at all times. Rather than formally separating the roles    \n  \u27a2  of CEO and Chairman, it is in the best interests of        \n     Citi\u2019s stockholders to retain flexibility to determine     \n     the optimal leadership structure at any given time, while  \n     ensuring that an independent board member oversees the     \n     Board. The Board values the flexibility of selecting the   \n     structure of leadership best suited to meet the needs of   \n     the Company and its stockholders.                          \n     If the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined, Citi\u2019s      \n     Guidelines provide that the Board will designate a lead    \n  \u27a2  director from among the independent directors. As set      \n     forth in the Guidelines, the duties of the independent     \n     Lead Director and the non-executive chair include, but     \n     are not limited to, the following functions:               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair  \n  \u2713  is not present, including executive sessions of the        \n     independent Directors;                                     \n  \u2713  serving as liaison between the Executive Chair and the     \n     independent Directors;                                     \n  \u2713  approving information sent to the Board;                   \n  \u2713  approving meeting agendas for the Board;                   \n  \u2713  approving meeting schedules to assure that there is        \n     sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; and    \n  \u2713  having the authority to call meetings of the independent   \n     Directors.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi has an empowered independent Board that provides      \n     oversight. As previously noted, Citi has had an            \n     independent Chair since 2009. Fourteen of the Board\u2019s      \n     sixteen current directors, and 100% of each of the         \n     Board\u2019s Audit Committee; Nomination, Governance and        \n  \u27a2  Public Affairs Committee; and Personnel and Compensation   \n     Committee satisfy the independence standards of the NYSE,  \n     Citi\u2019s independence standards, and other regulatory        \n     independence requirements. Moreover, the Board holds       \n     executive sessions of its independent directors            \n     throughout the year, at which the independent Chair        \n     presides.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  The stockholder proposal is unnecessary given the   \n  current framework the Board has in place to ensure  \n  independent leadership for the Board at all times   \n  and could restrict the Board\u2019s decision-making      \n  ability and limit the options available to the      \n  Board in structuring effective leadership;          \n  therefore the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this  \n  Proposal 6.                                         \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  126  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nProposal 7 James McRitchie and Myra K. Young have submitted the\nfollowing proposal for consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting.\nProposal 7 - Increase Diversity of Director Nominees Resolved:\nShareholders of Citigroup Inc. (\u2018Citigroup\u2019 or \u2018Company\u2019) urge\nthe board to adopt a policy (\u2018Policy\u2019) of promoting significant\nrepresentation of employee perspectives among corporate decision\nmakers by requiring the initial list of candidates from which\nnew director nominees are chosen (\u2018Initial List\u2019) by the\nNominations and Governance Committee include (but need not be\nlimited to) non-management employees. The Policy should provide\nthat any third-party consultant asked to furnish an Initial List\nwill be requested to include such candidates. Whereas: There is\ngrowing consensus that employees on corporate boards can\ncontribute to long-term corporate sustainability. Policymakers\nnote, having companies run exclusively to benefit shareholders\ncontributes to \u201cstagnant wages, runaway executive compensation\nand underinvestment in research and innovation.\u201d 1The Business\nRoundtable asks corporations to align with stakeholder\ninterests, including employees. 2 Employee representation grows\nlong-term value of companies in several ways. According to the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, giving workers formal\ncontrol rights increases female board representation and raises\ncapital formation. 3Employees are also often more diverse than\nboards in terms of race, gender, and wealth. The German \u201cco-\ndetermination\u201d model of shared governance provides a check\nagainst short-term capital allocation practices. 4 The 2018 UK\nCorporate Governance Code encourages boards to establish a\nmethod for gathering workforce views. Options include a director\nappointed from the workforce, a formal workforce advisory panel\nor designating a director to liaise with workers. 5 Senators\nBaldwin and Warren introduced legislation codifying employee\nrepresentation on corporate boards, noting that modern corporate\ngovernance needs to be accountable wider interests, notably\nemployees. 6Polling demonstrates bipartisan public support (over\n53%) for employee representation. 7 Anticipated benefits include\nreduced turnover as employees are more empowered to influence\nfirm-specific investments, better informed decision-making\nbecause employees have specialized knowledge, better monitoring\nof management with increased information channels, and reduced\nmyopia since employees often take a longer-term view. 8 While\nour Board satisfies independence requirements and strives for a\nculture of participation, 9it lacks formal representation from\nnon-management employees, who bring a different understanding of\noperations than typical directors. Additionally, Citigroup\u2019s CEO\nto median employee pay ratio is 482:1 and our Company has no\nemployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to help grow employee\nwealth and engagement. 10 The Policy we propose resembles the\nRooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority\ncandidates for head coaching and senior operations openings. By\nadopting the Rooney Rule, National Football League teams\nincreased diversity and set a precedent for other industries.\nPolicies similar to the Rooney Rule have been adopted by Amazon,\nCostco, Home Depot, Activision Blizzard, Dover, Expedia,\nFastenal, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, L Bands, Robert Half\nlnternational, Ross Stores and others. Also consider the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency levied a $400 million penalty\non our Company on October 7, 2020. 11 Increase Long-Term\nShareholder Value\nVote to Increase Diversity of Director Nominees\u2014 Proposal 7\n                                                                \n      https://www.                                              \n  1   nytimes.com/2019/01/06/opinion/warren-workers-boards.     \n      html                                                      \n      https://opportunity.                                      \n  2   businessroundtable.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BRT-S\u2026  \n      pdf                                                       \n  3   http://economics. mit.edu/files/17273                     \n  4   https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/\u2026  \n      pdf                                                       \n  5   https://assets.                                           \n      kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/uk/pdf/2018/07/designated-NED. pdf  \n  6   https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-shouldnt-be-acco\u2026  \n  7   https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/20l8/12/14/employe\u2026  \n  8   https://www.corpgov.                                      \n      net/2020/04/kokkinis-and-sergakis-employee-participatio\u2026  \n  9   https://hosteddocs. ittoolbox.com/employeeparticipation.  \n      pdf                                                       \n      https://smlr.                                             \n  10  rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/rutgerskelloggreport_ap\u2026  \n      pdf                                                       \n  11  http://www.                                               \n      radicalcompliance.com/2020/10/l8/citigroup-part-iii-bet\u2026  \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  127  \n                              \nManagement Comment Summary The Proposal requests that Citi\npromotes significant employee representation on the Board by\nadopting a Rooney Rule Policy mandating that the initial list of\nboard candidates include non-management employees. The proponent\nbelieves by adopting this policy, the benefits to the Board,\namong others, would be increasing diversity and providing an\navenue to gather workforce views. At Citi, there is no\nprohibition on nominations by or of employees; the procedures\nfor doing so are outlined on pages 45-46 of this Proxy\nStatement. The Board believes it is problematic to mandate\ninclusion of individuals on the candidate list based on a single\nqualification \u2013 employment by Citi \u2013 without requiring that such\ncandidates meet Citi\u2019s overall Director Qualifications. Adopting\nsuch a practice would require us to deviate from our existing\nrigorous processes and could diminish the effectiveness of our\nBoard. We believe an employee candidate for the Board of\nDirectors should be evaluated by the same standards and criteria\nas any other candidate. The Board believes that changing its\nprocess regarding board nominations and memberships to include\nCompany employees as outlined by this Proposal is unnecessary to\naddress the concerns the Proposal purports to address; could\ncause Citi to be non-compliant with the Company and regulatory\nindependence requirements; and will not enhance value for our\nstockholders or employees. Important Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Determining the qualifications that a director candidate   \n     should possess for service on Citi\u2019s Board is the          \n     responsibility of the Nomination, Governance and Public    \n     Affairs Committee (Committee). These qualifications are    \n     reviewed and approved every year and published in this     \n     Proxy Statement and as part of Citi\u2019s Corporate            \n     Governance Guidelines. The Committee, in setting the       \n  \u27a2  qualifications for service on Citi\u2019s Board, values the     \n     insights gained from diverse, professional, educational,   \n     and financial backgrounds at the senior executive or       \n     director-level leadership positions. Many of our           \n     directors also have experience on boards of other global   \n     public companies, giving them a broad understanding of     \n     corporate governance practices and trends, challenges,     \n     and strategies.                                            \n     The Proposal implies that having non-management employees  \n     on the Board would help to increase employee engagement.   \n     Citi\u2019s employees have numerous opportunities to express    \n     their views and concerns and the Proposal does not         \n     provide support to evidence that employees are not         \n     well-served by the current Board selection process.        \n     Citi\u2019s employees, including those below the senior         \n     leadership level, have opportunities to engage directly    \n     and indirectly with Board members, presenting at Board or  \n     Board Committees meetings; participating in Town Halls,    \n     diversity events, and other networking opportunities; and  \n  \u27a2  by having their concerns voiced to the Board through the   \n     Board\u2019s review of Voice of the Employee (VOE) survey       \n     results, issues raised through the Ethics Hotline and      \n     other employee-identified concerns reviewed with the       \n     Board and its Committees, including the Ethics, Conduct    \n     and Culture Committee. The Company encourages employees    \n     to raise issues or questions and provides multiple         \n     channels for them to do so. To keep employees informed     \n     and to provide the opportunity for them to engage senior   \n     leadership, the Chief Executive Officer, President and     \n     other senior leaders regularly host Town Hall meetings to  \n     provide business updates and answer questions posed by     \n     employees.                                                 \n     The supporting statement of the Proposal suggests that     \n     Citi does not provide an ESOP or other opportunities for   \n     employees to build wealth. Citi has robust programs to     \n     help employees grow employee wealth, including in fact an  \n     ESOP that is part of our 401(k) plan. Furthermore, more    \n     than 10,000 of our employees were awarded Citi stock       \n  \u27a2  through our stockholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan in   \n     2020. The creation of employee wealth is indeed a          \n     particular focus of Citi, as one would expect from a       \n     leading global financial institution. Citi offers          \n     numerous opportunities for employees to grow wealth        \n     through retirement plan programs, employee discounts on    \n     banking services and advice offerings for managing         \n     personal wealth.                                           \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  128  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \n                                                                \n     The Proposal indicates that selecting non-management       \n     employees as directors could improve diversity at the      \n     Company. Citi is proud of the diversity of its Board,      \n     which already offers diverse skill sets and professional   \n     backgrounds, as well as gender, ethnic and racial          \n     diversity. Currently the Board members are 50% female and  \n  \u27a2  19% people of color \u2013 10 out of 16 directors are gender    \n     or ethnically diverse. In addition, Citi has launched      \n     numerous initiatives to increase the diversity of its      \n     workforce through the establishment of internal policies   \n     and standards that require an initial pool of diverse      \n     candidates from which new employees are hired including,   \n     but not limited to, qualified women and minority           \n     candidates.                                                \n     Citi\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that at     \n     least two-thirds of the members of the Board should be     \n     independent. Except for two director candidates, all of    \n     Citi\u2019s current nominees for directors are deemed to be     \n     independent (see page 24 of this Proxy Statement). This    \n     Proposal suggests we should add another director employed  \n     by the Company. This would decrease the number of          \n  \u27a2  directors who qualify as independent of the Company.       \n     Including candidates employed by Citi to the slate of      \n     nominees, could, assuming their election by stockholders,  \n     alter the balance of independent and non-independent       \n     members on the Board and thereby make it more challenging  \n     for the Company to meet applicable NYSE Listed Company     \n     Rules and SEC rules with regard to membership of the       \n     Board and its committees.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  The Board believes that changing our process        \n  regarding board nominations and memberships to      \n  include non-management employees as outlined by     \n  this Proposal is unnecessary because the issues it  \n  purports to address are better served by existing   \n  practices at the firm; could cause the Board to     \n  fail to comply with regulatory and Citi             \n  independence requirements; and will not enhance     \n  value for our stockholders or employees;            \n  therefore, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST      \n  this Proposal 7.                                    \n                                                      \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  129  \n                              \nProposal 8 Miller/Howard Investments, Inc. on behalf of Luc\nTheeuwes and the Greater Manchester Pension Fund have submitted\nthe following proposal for consideration at the 2021 Annual\nMeeting.

Both \u201cdirect and\nindirect lobbying\u201d and \u201cgrassroots lobbying communications\u201d\ninclude efforts at the local, state, and federal levels. The\nreport shall be presented to the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee and posted on Citigroup\u2019s website.\nSupporting Statement Citigroup spent $52,403,000 from 2010 \u2014\n2019 on federal lobbying. This does not include state lobbying\nexpenditures in the 42 states where Citigroup lobbies but\ndisclosure is uneven or absent. 1And Citigroup also lobbies\nabroad, reportedly spending between \u20ac700,000 \u2014 \u20ac799,000 on\nlobbying in Europe for 2019. Citigroup belongs to the Chamber of\nCommerce, which has spent over $1.6 billion on lobbying since\n1998. Citigroup is also a member of the Business Roundtable\n(BRT) and signed the Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation\nto be socially responsible. Citigroup does not disclose its\ntrade association payments and social welfare organizations, or\nthe amounts used for lobbying, including grassroots. Grassroots\nlobbying does not get reported the federal level under the\nLobbying Disclosure Act, and disclosure is uneven or absent in\nstates. We are concerned that Citigroup\u2019s lack of direct and\nindirect lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks when\nits lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example,\nCitigroup has pledged $1 billion in strategic initiatives to\nhelp close the racial wealth gap, 2yet has previously drawn\nattention lobbying for a bill undermining \u201cfair lending rules\nthat work to counter racial discrimination.\u201d 3And Citigroup\nshowed leadership supporting the Paris Agreement on climate\nchange, 4yet the Chamber of Commerce undermined the Paris\nclimate accord. 5And Citigroup publicly supported COVID-19\nefforts, but the Chamber directly lobbied against using the\nDefense Production Act to speed production of life-saving\npersonal protective equipment for workers. 6We believe the\nreputational damage stemming from these misalignments can harm\nthe company\u2019s long-term value creation. Thus, we urge Citigroup\nto expand its lobbying disclosure.\n                                                                \n  1  https://publicintegrity.org/state-politics/amid-federal-\u2026  \n  2  https://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2020/200923a.htm.      \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  130  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \n                                                                \n  3  https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/crapo-instead-of-tak\u2026  \n  4  https://blog.citigroup.com/2017/06/citi-expresses-suppor\u2026  \n  5  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-09/paris\u2026  \n  6  https://chamberofcommercewatch.org/2054-2/                 \n                                                                \nManagement Comment Summary The Proposal would be substantively\nduplicative and not an effective use of Citi\u2019s resources as Citi\nalready has a comprehensive system of reporting on its lobbying\nactivities and political contributions. Citi discloses its\nlobbying activities as required by law in the more than 21\nstates in which it is actively engaged in lobbying, and at the\nfederal level. Citi provides this information on its website,\nwhich allows stockholders to access Citi\u2019s filings in the states\nor under the Lobbying Disclosure Act to view the issues on which\nCiti engages through its lobbying efforts. Citi also publishes\nannually on its website its political contributions made by the\nCiti Political Action Committees. Finally, Citi lists the names\nof the significant trade and business associations in which it\nparticipates. Important Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Citi already has in place measures to promote              \n  \u27a2  transparency in and oversight of its lobbying and          \n     political activity.                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     First, as required by its Charter, the Nomination,         \n     Governance and Public Affairs Committee of Citi\u2019s Board    \n  \u2713  of Directors provides oversight over the Company\u2019s         \n     political contributions, trade association activities,     \n     and lobbying strategy.                                     \n     Second, Citi has links on its website to state government  \n     websites and the federal website where its lobbying        \n  \u2713  activities are reported. Citi discloses U.S. federal       \n     lobbying activity quarterly, as required by the Lobbying   \n     Disclosure Act (LDA). LDA requires disclosure of the       \n     issues and costs of its lobbying efforts.                  \n     Third, Citi posts on its website a list, updated           \n     annually, of all corporate political contributions made    \n  \u2713  by Citi as well as contributions made by Citi\u2019s Political  \n     Action Committees (PAC).

As noted above, the      \n  \u27a2  Citi Board\u2019s Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs     \n     Committee provides oversight of Citi\u2019s membership in       \n     trade associations. In addition, most of Citi\u2019s advocacy   \n     is done directly. The overall amount of funds provided to  \n     trade associations for membership is not material to Citi  \n     and the amount used by those trade associations for        \n     lobbying, a small percentage of Citi\u2019s dues payments, is   \n     even less significant.                                     \n     Citi engages in lobbying activities on its own behalf and  \n     determines on which issues to lobby based on careful       \n     consideration of political and legislative matters that    \n     may have an impact on Citi. Citi\u2019s lobbying efforts are    \n     necessarily focused on issues and positions favored by     \n     Citi. While trade and business associations may lobby on   \n  \u27a2  behalf of the financial industry, this \u201cindirect\u201d          \n     lobbying does not necessarily represent Citi\u2019s positions.  \n     Attributing these lobbying efforts to Citi\u2019s               \n     decision-making would be misleading to stockholders. Citi  \n     is also a member of trade associations for a variety of    \n     reasons not related to lobbying, including for             \n     information gathering and professional development.        \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  131  \n                              \n                                                                \n     Citi has had a long-standing commitment to environmental   \n     sustainability. The focus of the Proposal\u2019s Supporting     \n     Statement is on climate change and how certain             \n     organizations are viewed in engaging on climate-related    \n     issues. In Citi\u2019s 2020 Taskforce on Climate-related        \n     Financial Disclosures Report, we published a table on      \n     page 37 listing Citi\u2019s climate-related engagements with    \n  \u27a2  key trade associations, including the Chamber of           \n     Commerce, and we note that Citi is helping lead a group    \n     of companies that is advocating with the Chamber to        \n     continue to shift its climate policy positions. In         \n     particular, we are collectively speaking with the Chamber  \n     to communicate where we believe their positioning is out   \n     of step with many members, most notably on carbon          \n     pricing.                                                   \n     Citi does not directly or indirectly make payments to      \n  \u27a2  independent expenditure campaigns and has procedures in    \n     place to prevent such payments from being made.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     First, Citi policy prohibits contributions for             \n     independent expenditures which means it cannot make such   \n     payments directly. \u201cIndependent expenditures\u201d are          \n  \u2713  expenditures by an entity other than the political         \n     candidate or his or her campaign that support the          \n     candidate (or criticize his/her opponent) and are          \n     generally made by SuperPACs.                               \n     Second, to prevent any indirect funding of SuperPACs,      \n     Citi requires, before Citi pays its dues, that trade and   \n  \u2713  business associations attest that they have a process      \n     that assures that no funds provided by any Citi entity     \n     (whether by way of dues or otherwise) will be used for     \n     independent expenditures.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The report requested by the proposal would be duplicative  \n     and is not an effective use of Citi\u2019s resources. Indeed,   \n     Citi is already directly engaging with key trade           \n  \u27a2  associations on a pro-active sustainability agenda. We     \n     believe that the interest of our stockholders will best    \n     be served by continuing to focus our efforts on our        \n     engagement with trade associations on environmental        \n     sustainability matters.                                    \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Because it already has extensive disclosure         \n  practices pertaining to its political               \n  contributions and lobbying activities, disclosures  \n  of its political contributions and lobbying         \n  expenditures, disclosure of its trade association   \n  participation, and a Political Activities           \n  Statement outlining its policies and procedures     \n  surrounding political and lobbying activities,      \n  Citi does not believe the additional disclosure     \n  requested by the stockholder proposal would be      \n  useful to stockholders. In addition, disclosure of  \n  indirect lobbying activities by outside trade       \n  associations in itself would not offer              \n  stockholders a useful nor clear window into Citi\u2019s  \n  approach to lobbying and political activity. The    \n  disclosure requested by the Proposal would thus     \n  not be an effective use of Citi\u2019s resources or      \n  management\u2019s time, nor would it provide             \n  stockholders with additional meaningful             \n  disclosures; therefore the Board recommends a vote  \n  AGAINST this Proposal 8.                            \n                                                      \nProposal 9 CtW Investment Group has submitted the following\nproposal for consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting. RESOLVED\nthat shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (\u201cCiti\u201d) urge the Board of\nDirectors to oversee a racial equity audit analyzing Citi\u2019s\nadverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of\ncolor. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and\ncustomers should be considered in determining the specific\nmatters to be analyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at\nreasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary\ninformation, should be publicly disclosed on Citi\u2019s website.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT High-profile police killings of black\npeople\u2014most recently George Floyd\u2014have galvanized the movement\nfor racial justice. That movement, together with the\ndisproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused\nthe attention of the media, the public and policy makers on\nsystemic racism, racialized violence and inequities in\nemployment, health care, and the criminal justice system. In\nSeptember 2020, CEO Michael Corbat noted Citi \u201c[was] committed\nto leading the way and investing in communities of color to\nbuild wealth and strong financial futures.\u201d 1Citi has committed\n$1 billion over four years to close the racial wealth gap.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  132  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nCiti has a conflicted history when it comes to addressing racial\ninjustice within the communities it serves. In 2019, the\nTreasury Department\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of Currency\nassessed a $25 million fine against Citi for failing to offer\nall eligible customers mortgage discounts and credits, adversely\nimpacting customers of color. Citi also imposes a minimum\nmaintenance fee of $12 per month for checking account customers\nor a minimum daily balance of $1500. Such minimum fees and\nbalances disproportionately impact people of color and can\ninhibit wealth creation among these communities. Lastly, the\ncompany discloses that over 45.8 % of its workforce are people\nof color, yet there is only one Black executive within its\nC-suite, according to a study by Stanford University. The impact\nof Citi\u2019s practices on communities of color has been exacerbated\nby the coronavirus pandemic. Citi was one of the banks selected\nfor the Paycheck Protection Program. A recent House of\nRepresentatives\u2019 report found that Citi instituted a policy of\nonly accepting applications for funding from clients with an\nexisting banking relationship, despite its own internal\nassessment that recognized \u201ca policy of not taking non-customers\nmight create heightened risk of disparate impact on minority and\nwomen-owned businesses.\u201d 2 Citi\u2019s activities with potential\nadverse impacts are not limited to the employment and lending\ncontexts. Citi donated $242,000 during the 2020 election cycle\nto 74 members of Congress who are rated \u201cF\u201d by the NAACP. A\nracial equity audit would help Citi identify, prioritize, remedy\nand avoid adverse impacts on nonwhite stakeholders and\ncommunities of color. We urge Citi to assess its behavior\nthrough a racial equity lens in order to obtain a complete\npicture of how it contributes to, and could help dismantle,\nsystemic racism.\n                                                                \n     Citi Press Release, September 23, 2020, available at       \n     https://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2020/200923a.htm.      \n     Banking Dive, \u201cHouse panel blasts banks over gap in PPP    \n  1  loan processing times,\u201d Oct. 19, 2020, available at        \n  2  https://www.bankingdive.com/news/paycheck-protection-pro\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \nManagement Comment Summary Citi has made a commitment to social\njustice and racial equity in its operations, business dealings,\nand engagement with stakeholders, customers and employees. As\nrecently as September 2020, Citi released a 104 page report on\nthe economic cost of Black inequality in the United States\ntitled Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps , and shortly\nthereafter Citi announced its Action for Racial Equity\nInitiative which pledged more than $1 billion in strategic\ninitiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase\neconomic mobility in the United States. The reports generated by\nCiti\u2019s ongoing work in the areas of social justice and racial\nequity are made widely available to the public, including all of\nCiti\u2019s stakeholders. Given Citi\u2019s commitment to addressing\nracial disparities in banking, matters of social justice, and\nthe racial wealth gap, and the resulting reports and disclosures\nCiti publishes in furtherance of its commitment, Citi believes\nit is already addressing the intent of this Proposal - to help\nCiti identify, prioritize, remedy and avoid adverse impacts on\nnonwhite stakeholders and communities of color -thereby\nrendering the Proposal unnecessary. While we disagree with the\noverall approach in this Proposal, we are completely aligned\nwith its stated goal of addressing racial inequity in the\nfinancial sector. Important Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Citi has been an active participant in the movement for    \n     social justice and racial equity within the financial      \n     sector. Over the past decade, Citi and the Citi            \n     Foundation have invested nearly $100 million in programs   \n     and partnerships aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.   \n  \u27a2  In 2020, Citi continued its commitment to closing the      \n     racial wealth gap with a distinct focus on addressing      \n     racial inequity through its Action for Racial Equity       \n     Initiative by committing $1 billion for strategic          \n     initiatives which embody Citi\u2019s comprehensive approach     \n     towards:                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u2713  providing greater access to banking and credit in          \n     communities of color,                                      \n  \u2713  increasing investment in Black-owned businesses,           \n  \u2713  expanding homeownership among Black Americans, and         \n                                                                \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  133  \n                              \n                                                                \n  \u2713  advancing anti-racist practices in the financial services  \n     industry.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Additionally, the Citi Foundation is expanding             \n     employability and entrepreneurship efforts serving Black   \n  \u27a2  youth as part of a new three-year $100 million investment  \n     in its successful Pathways to Progress initiative. Please  \n     visit www.citi.com/racialequity for further information    \n     on the aforementioned initiatives.                         \n     Citi is also working to increase representation of Black   \n     employees in the U.S., especially in senior roles, and     \n     encourage a stronger awareness of the legacy of racism     \n     and discrimination in the workforce and within the         \n     industry. Citi established representation goals in 2019    \n  \u27a2  in order to increase U.S. minorities in senior and higher  \n     paying roles by 2021. Citi has been very transparent       \n     about the results of our pay equity review by reporting    \n     on our diversity and inclusion efforts across the firm.    \n     See Pay Equity on page 77 of this Proxy Statement for      \n     further information.                                       \n     As a part of its renewed commitment to racial equity in    \n     the U.S., in 2020 Citi donated an additional $10 million   \n  \u27a2  to Black-led organizations fighting for racial justice,    \n     including the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the  \n     National Urban League, and the National Fair Housing       \n     Alliance.                                                  \n     As a part of Citi\u0092s work to actively address racial         \n     inequity, Citi                                             \n     has undertaken thoughtful, objective research and          \n  \u27a2  analysis on the issues affecting nonwhite stakeholders     \n     and communities of                                         \n     color within the financial sector and at Citi. To ensure   \n     transparency of this work, Citi has funded and made        \n     publically-available materials, such as the:               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     2020 Report: Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps, The       \n     Economic Cost of Black Inequality in the United States, a  \n  \u2713  104 page report published to show the cost of racial       \n     inequality through objective analysis which identified     \n     four key racial gaps \u0096 wages, education, housing, and       \n     investment \u0096 and suggesting ways to address each;           \n     2019 Report: Environmental, Social, and Governance         \n     Report, a 155 page report published, in part, to describe  \n  \u2713  how Citi has committed to identifying the racial           \n     inequality in its industry and to describe the efforts     \n     Citi has taken towards remedying these disparities; and    \n     2019 Report: Talent and Diversity Annual Report, a 20      \n  \u2713  page report published to provide increased transparency    \n     and accountability around topics of race, gender, and      \n     equal pay for equal work within Citi\u0092s own workforce.       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Adoption of the proposal would not be in the best          \n     interests of Citi\u0092s stockholders because the audit          \n     requested is unnecessary in light of the comprehensive     \n     reporting and procedures that Citi has pledged in          \n     fulfilling its $1 billion initiative announced in          \n  \u27a2  September 2020. In summary, Citi remains fully committed   \n     to our ongoing efforts to address racial inequity and      \n     close the racial wealth gap; however, we do not believe    \n     that this stockholder proposal would advance those goals.  \n     Furthermore, the requested audit would divert company      \n     resources without providing real value to the Company or   \n     its stockholders.                                          \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  The Board believes the stockholder proposal is not  \n  necessary since Citi has clearly demonstrated that  \n  it has in place initiatives and programs intended   \n  to address racial inequity, including the racial    \n  wealth gap, and Citi has publically reported on     \n  its efforts to identify, prioritize and remedy      \n  racial inequity in the financial sector; therefore  \n  the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal   \n  9.                                                  \n                                                      \nProposal 10 Harrington Investments, Inc. has submitted the\nfollowing proposal for consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting.\nWhereas , our Chief Executive Officer in August of 2019 signed a\nStatement on the Purpose of a Corporation, including a statement\nsupporting \u0093... the communities in which we work ...\nrespect(ing) the people in our communities and protect(ing) the\nenvironment by embracing sustainability practices across our\nbusiness, and Whereas , despite our company\u0092s commitment to\nembracing sustainability practices mentioned above, Citigroup is\none of the world\u0092s top funders of fossil fuels, lending, between\n2016 through 2019, over $19.7 billion to fossil fuel companies\nand business entities financing fossil fuels according to\nBanking on Climate Change: Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2020\n, with no specific policy constraining fossil fuel financing in\nour bank\u0092s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, and\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  134  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nWhereas , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nconcluded that to avoid the worst global catastrophe, we will\nhave to cut the emission of global warming gasses 45% from 2010\nlevels and we have only 11 years left to make this happen;\nWhereas , these facts are evidence of incongruities between\nstatements made by our Chief Executive Officer and the Board, as\nfiduciaries, as reflected in our company\u2019s governance documents\nincluding Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation and Committee\nCharters and Delaware law; Whereas , a shareholder proposal in\n2020 requested that the board review the Statement on the\nPurpose of the Corporation to conduct a review of Citigroup\u2019s\ngovernance documents making recommendations to shareholders how\nsuch statement could be implemented by management, however, the\nboard opposed the resolution and no action was taken; and\nWhereas , the State of Delaware has adopted and recently amended\na law allowing our company to become a Public Benefit\nCorporation (PBC) by amending our company\u2019s Certificate of\nIncorporation to establish a public purpose, such as promoting a\nsustainable global economy, consistent with our CEO\u2019s statement\nto commit our company to all stakeholders; and Whereas , in the\nopinion of the proponent, the approach of this law seems\nconsistent with our CEO\u2019s commitment to the Statement, providing\nthe opportunity for the board to legally articulate the purpose\nof our corporation in a manner that would reconcile its\naccountability to all stakeholders, be it therefore Resolved ,\nthat shareholders request the board of directors to approve an\namendment to the company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nto become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) pursuant to\nDelaware law, and to submit the proposed amendment to\nshareholders for our approval. Such a change would enable the\ncompany to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that\nbalances the stockholder\u2019s pecuniary interests, and the best\ninterests of those materially affected by the corporation\u2019s\nconduct. Supporting Statement : Following Citi\u2019s historic\nannouncement of hiring the first woman to be the CEO of a major\nUS bank, committing to become a public benefit financial\ninstitution with accountability to all stakeholders will cement\nunparalleled leadership and vision for our bank for decades to\ncome. Management Comment Summary The Stockholder Proposal\nrequests that the Board approve an amendment to the Company\u2019s\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation to become a public benefit\ncorporation under Delaware corporate law and to submit the\nproposed amendment for approval by stockholders. The Proponent\nstates that, if Citi converts to a public benefit corporation,\nCiti would act in a \u201cresponsible and sustainable manner\u201d for all\nstakeholders. The Board believes Citi has clearly demonstrated\nthat it acts in a \u201cresponsible and sustainable manner\u201d in the\nway it provides its services and operates its business, in the\nway it engages with the communities in which it operates, in the\nway it recruits, develops and promotes its people and in the way\nit engages in the financial markets \u2013 all of which inure to the\nbenefit of its stockholders and the broader base of its\nstakeholders. Citi has shown its commitment to acting in a\nresponsible and sustainable manner through, among other things,\nits leadership in environmental and sustainability issues; its\nefforts to address racial disparities in the availability of\nservices in the banking industry, its commitment to help\neradicate the racial wealth gap; its commitment to strengthening\ndiversity in its Board, leadership, workforce and the entities\nwith which it does business; and its willingness to take public\npositions on issues of societal importance.

The Board believes\nthis commitment is part of the fabric of the way Citi does\nbusiness and engages with the markets and the world, and\nchanging its form of corporate organization in the manner\ndescribed in the Stockholder Proposal is neither necessary to,\nand will only distract the Board\u2019s and management\u2019s focus and\nCiti\u2019s resources away from, achieving the very objectives that\nare underlying the Stockholder Proposal. Important Points to\nConsider\n                                                                \n     There are numerous examples of how Citi\u2019s actions show     \n     its deep commitment to operating in a responsible and      \n     sustainable manner. Citi presents many of these actions    \n     in reports that it publishes each year. We encourage       \n  \u27a2  stockholders to visit our website to read our disclosure   \n     of Citi\u2019s initiatives, including the Environmental,        \n     Social and Governance Report, the Diversity Annual Report  \n     and this Proxy Statement. A selection of recent efforts    \n     includes the following:                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     On March 1, 2021, Jane Fraser became the CEO of Citi. Ms.  \n     Fraser is the first female CEO of a U.S. Bank. Citi\u2019s      \n     Board is 50% female.                                       \n     Citi remains the only major U.S. bank to have joined the   \n     Principles for Responsible Banking, which includes a       \n     commitment to align our business strategy to be            \n     consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. In addition,    \n     Citi's new CEO announced on March 1, 2021 that Citi has    \n     committed to reaching Net Zero by 2050 and will develop a  \n     plan to achieve this goal. Because the Company recognizes  \n     the importance of making this plan credible, management    \n     expects to spend up to 12 months developing it and         \n     establishing interim targets and methodologies. Once the   \n  \u2713  plan has been published, Citi intends to report annually   \n  \u2713  on our progress and goals.                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n     Citi has exceeded our two prior environmental finance      \n     goals, beginning with a $50 billion goal set in 2007 and   \n     achieved three years early in 2013, and a $100 billion     \n  \u2713  goal beginning in 2014 and achieved four years early in    \n     2019. In July 2020, Citi announced an ambitious $250       \n     billion goal, to help accelerate our financing of          \n     environmental and climate solutions with our clients and   \n     to challenge other market participants.                    \n     Citi endorsed the TCFD Recommendations in 2017 and         \n     published its first TCFD report, Finance for a             \n     Climate-Resilient Future, in 2018, for which we won an     \n     International Climate Reporting Award. Citi recently       \n  \u2713  published its 2020 TCFD climate disclosure report,         \n     Finance for a Climate-Resilient Future II, which           \n     includes, among other things, a table summarizing Citi\u2019s   \n     TCFD implementation progress and an illustration of our    \n     enhanced climate change governance.                        \n     In October, Citi launched a new Diversity Effectiveness    \n     team as part of Citi\u2019s Talent Acquisition function to      \n     provide guidance and expertise, and to challenge our       \n  \u2713  global hiring practices, processes and policies. The team  \n     also spearheads the development of skills and              \n     capabilities across our hiring manager and recruiting      \n     teams on the effective use of candidate sourcing,          \n     engagement, and selection tools and processes.             \n     Beginning in January 2020, Citi expanded the recruitment   \n     standard for a diverse slate of candidates by adding the   \n     assistant vice president, vice president and senior vice   \n     president levels. It also increased the global target for  \n  \u2713  qualified diverse slates to 80%. For the period January 1  \n     to October 31, 2020, 86.3% of roles that were posted       \n     globally with a qualified slate included a diverse slate   \n     of candidates, with at least one woman and/or visible      \n     minority.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     There are also practical challenges to the plan outlined   \n     in the Stockholder Proposal. The Stockholder Proposal      \n     does not provide any consideration for how Citi would      \n     implement this radical change to its corporate             \n     organization. To the knowledge of the Board, there is no   \n     public company in the United States that has converted to  \n     a public benefit corporation and only one public benefit   \n     corporation in the United States that has gone public.     \n     The Board has not had an opportunity to consult with       \n  \u27a2  management and its legal and other advisors to determine   \n     how a fundamental change to Citi\u2019s corporate organization  \n     would be implemented. The Board has not engaged with       \n     stockholders, stakeholders and its employees to assess     \n     their perspectives. The Board believes it should not be    \n     required to present the matter described in the            \n     Stockholder Proposal for stockholder vote before it has    \n     properly considered the benefits and risks and,            \n     importantly, can make an assessment that it is in the      \n     best interests of the stockholders.                        \n     The following are a few of the important considerations    \n  \u27a2  that the Board believes it would need to assess before it  \n     could reasonably present this matter before stockholders:  \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  136  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \n                                                                \n     Regulatory Uncertainty. Citi is a large, global financial  \n     services company that is subject to regulation and         \n     oversight by federal and state governments, regulatory     \n     agencies and self-regulatory bodies around the world,      \n     including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission,      \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer        \n     Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit           \n     Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the       \n  \u2713  Federal Reserve System and the Securities and Exchange     \n     Commission in the United States. Citi is required to       \n     comply with a complex set of intersecting rules,           \n     regulations and guidelines. Citi has not consulted with    \n     any of these regulatory authorities as to whether a        \n     conversion to a public benefit corporation is consistent   \n     with these requirements to which Citi must comply. There   \n     is no financial services company in the United States of   \n     the scale of Citi that is operating as a public benefit    \n     corporation, let alone converted to one.                   \n     Market Uncertainty. The lack of precedents of public       \n     companies that are operating as, or have converted into,   \n     a public benefit corporation presents real uncertainty as  \n  \u2713  to the possible market reaction to such a change. The      \n     Board does not have information as to how institutional    \n     and retail investors would react to this change, and       \n     whether the change will impact the long-term value of the  \n     company.                                                   \n     Legal Process and Cost Uncertainty. Although the specific  \n     procedural corporate law requirements under Delaware law   \n     are identifiable, the Board has not considered how a       \n     change as described in the Stockholder Proposal would be   \n     implemented. Additionally, there is considerable           \n     uncertainty as to the costs associated with such a         \n  \u2713  change. Inevitably, a change like this would spawn         \n     massive lawsuits and derivative actions against Citi and   \n     the Board the cost of which would not be possible to       \n     estimate. Most importantly, for the Board, there is no     \n     clear direction as to how directors would exercise their   \n     fiduciary duties in approving this matter and bringing it  \n     for stockholder consideration.                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The Board and management are proud of the steps Citi has   \n     taken as a responsible corporate actor in its current      \n     form of corporate organization, and has shown its          \n     willingness to take steps to have a meaningful impact on   \n     the broader society, including through taking positions    \n  \u27a2  and adopting policies to protect members of society,       \n     whether through adopting responsible policies for firearm  \n     sales or adopting policies limiting the impact on the      \n     environment. Citi has set ambitious goals for itself and   \n     demonstrated a commitment to exceed them. Citi has also    \n     served as leader in the financial services industry in     \n     many of these areas.                                       \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  The Board believes that Citi\u2019s existing form of     \n  corporate organization provides the appropriate     \n  flexibility to promote the interests of our         \n  various stakeholders and to manage important        \n  diversity and ESG matters without the significant   \n  uncertainties, costs, and distractions that the     \n  Proposal\u2019s implementation would require; therefore  \n  the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal   \n  10.                                                 \n                                                      \nCiti 2021 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  137  \n                              \nSubmission of Future Stockholder Proposals Under SEC Rule 14a-8,\na stockholder who intends to present a proposal at the next\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders and who wishes the proposal to be\nincluded in the Proxy Statement for that meeting must submit the\nproposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of Citi at 388\nGreenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 and send to the\nfollowing email address: shareholderrelations@citi.com. The\nproposal must be received no later than November 17, 2021. The\nproposal and its proponent must satisfy all applicable\nrequirements of Rule 14a-8. Citi\u2019s By-laws permit a stockholder\nor group of stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least 3%\nof Citi common stock for at least three years to submit Director\nnominees (up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board,\nas determined in accordance with the By-laws) for inclusion in\nCiti\u2019s Proxy Statement if the nominating stockholder(s)\nsatisfies the requirements specified in the By-laws. With\nrespect to stockholder nominees for Director election submitted\nfor inclusion in Citi\u2019s Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual\nMeeting, written notice of nominations must be provided by the\nstockholder proponent(s) to Citi in accordance with Citi\u2019s By-\nlaws. The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received\nby, Citi\u2019s Corporate Secretary between October 18, 2021 and\nNovember 17, 2021. These deadlines are based on the 150th day\nand 120th day, respectively, before the one-year anniversary of\nthe date that the Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting was\nfirst sent to stockholders (which date, for purposes of Citi\u2019s\nBy-laws, is March 17, 2021). The ability to include a nominee in\nCiti\u2019s Proxy Statement is subject to the terms and conditions\nset forth in Citi\u2019s By-laws. With respect to stockholder\nnominees for Director election at the next Annual Meeting (other\nthan nominees submitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy materials)\nand stockholder proposals for consideration at the next Annual\nMeeting that are not submitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy\nmaterials under Rule 14a-8, written notice of nominations and\nproposals must be provided by the stockholder proponent to Citi\nin accordance with Citi\u2019s By-laws. The notice must be delivered\nto, or mailed and received by, Citi\u2019s Corporate Secretary,\nbetween December 28, 2021 and January 27, 2022 and must comply\nwith all applicable provisions of Citi\u2019s By-laws. You may obtain\na copy of Citi\u2019s Bylaws on Citi\u2019s website or by writing to the\nCorporate Secretary at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York\n10013. Cost of Annual Meeting and Proxy Solicitation Citi pays\nthe cost of the Annual Meeting and the cost of soliciting\nproxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Citi may\nsolicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, and similar\nmeans. No Director, officer, or employee of Citi will be\nspecially compensated for these activities. Citi also intends to\nrequest that brokers, banks, and other nominees solicit proxies\nfrom their principals and will pay the brokers, banks, and other\nnominees certain expenses they incur for such activities. Citi\nhas retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT\n06902, a proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation of\nproxies, for an estimated fee of $30,000 plus reimbursement of\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses. Householding Under SEC rules, a\nsingle set of Annual Reports and Proxy Statements may be sent to\nany household at which two or more stockholders reside if they\nappear to be members of the same family. Each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure,\nreferred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation stockholders receive and reduces mailing and\nprinting expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain\nstockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report\nand Proxy Statement will be sent to that address unless any\nstockholder at that address requested multiple sets of documents\nbe sent. However, if any stockholder who agreed to householding\nwishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement,\nhe or she may telephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to\nBroadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51\nMercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders sharing an\naddress who wish to receive a single set of reports may do so by\ncontacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial\nholders, or by contacting Broadridge at the address set forth\nabove, if they are record holders. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n       \n  138  \n       \nAbout the 2021 Annual Meeting\n                                                                \n  Q:  Who is soliciting my vote?                                \n      The Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. is soliciting    \n  A:  your vote at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Citi\u2019s            \n      stockholders.                                             \n  Q:  Where and when will the 2021 Annual Meeting take place?   \n      The Annual Meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m.     \n      E.T. on April 27, 2021 through a virtual meeting          \n      platform.

beneficial ownership in the            \n       securities and has not received such instructions.       \n       Broker non-votes will not be counted as shares entitled  \n       to vote on the relevant proposal.                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  If a nominee for Director is not re-elected by the required   \n  vote, he or she will remain in office until a successor is    \n  elected and qualified or until his or her earlier             \n  resignation or removal. Citi\u2019s By-laws provide that in the    \n  event a Director nominee is not re-elected, such Director     \n  shall offer to resign from his or her position as a           \n  Director. Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to  \n  postpone the effective date of the offer, the resignation     \n  shall become effective 60 days after the date of the          \n  election.                                                     \n  The result of the votes on an advisory vote on Citi\u2019s 2020    \n  executive compensation is not binding on the Board, whether   \n  or not the resolution is passed under the voting standards    \n  described above. In evaluating the stockholder vote on the    \n  advisory resolution, the Board will consider the voting       \n  results in their entirety.                                    \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                      \n  142  ABOUT THE 2021 ANNUAL MEETING  \n                                      \n                                                                \n  Q:  Is my vote confidential?                                  \n      In 2006, the Board adopted a confidential voting policy   \n      as part of its Corporate Governance Guidelines. Under     \n      the policy, except as necessary to meet applicable legal  \n      requirements or as otherwise described below, all votes,  \n      whether submitted by proxies, ballots, Internet voting,   \n      telephone voting, or otherwise are kept confidential for  \n      registered stockholders who request confidential          \n      treatment. If you are a registered stockholder and would  \n      like your vote kept confidential, please check the        \n      appropriate box on the proxy card or follow the           \n      instructions when submitting your vote by telephone,      \n  A:  mobile phone, QR Code or by the Internet. If you hold     \n      your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d or through an employee       \n      benefit plan or stock incentive plan, your vote already   \n      receives confidential treatment and you do not need to    \n      request confidential treatment in order to maintain the   \n      confidentiality of your vote.                             \n      The confidential voting policy will not apply in the      \n      event of a proxy contest or other solicitation based on   \n      an opposition Proxy Statement and in certain other        \n      limited circumstances. For further details regarding      \n      this policy, please see the Corporate Governance          \n      Guidelines, available on Citi\u2019s website at                \n      www.citigroup.com.                                        \n  Q:  Could other matters be decided at the 2021 Annual         \n      Meeting?                                                  \n      We don\u2019t know of any matters that will be considered at   \n      the Annual Meeting other than those described above.

CCAR refers to the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review. CCAR is an important regulatory supervisory\nmechanism for assessing the capital adequacy of banks,\nincluding, among other things, ensuring that banks have\nsufficient capital to continue to provide key financial services\nunder adverse economic and financial market scenarios. Banks may\nnot return capital to stockholders or take other capital actions\nunless the Federal Reserve Board indicates that it has \u201cno\nobjection\u201d to a bank\u2019s capital plan, including its requested\ncapital actions. Cumulative Earnings per Share for our\nPerformance Share Units is determined by adding the diluted\nearnings per share based on net income allocated to common\nstockholders from our quarterly earnings reports for the 12\nquarters of the applicable three-year performance period.\nEfficiency Ratio is total operating expenses divided by total\nrevenues (net of interest expense). This ratio generally\ncompares the cost of generating revenue to the amount of revenue\ngenerated. A lower cost is preferable to a higher cost in\ngenerating the same amount of revenue, and therefore a lower\nefficiency ratio is generally better than a higher one. This\nmetric encourages management to consider the costs of generating\nadditional revenue instead of simply maximizing revenue, and can\nbe used on a relative basis to identify which businesses are\nmanaged better than others. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) divided by Net Outflows. The\nLCR is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level\nof HQLA to meet liquidity needs under an acute three-day stress\nscenario. Operating Leverage represents the annual change in\n[(Revenues, net of Interest Expense in bps), less (the annual\nchange in Operating Expenses in bps)]. Return on Assets (ROA) is\nnet income divided by average assets as determined under U.S.\nGAAP. Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) is net income for\na business or Citigroup (minus preferred dividends in the case\nof Citigroup) divided by average tangible common equity for the\nyear. Management views this metric as an appropriate indication\nof the long-term potential of Citi\u2019s operating businesses to\ndeliver long-term value to stockholders. Total Payout Ratio is\nthe sum of dividends paid to common shareholders plus common\nshare repurchases, divided by (Net Income, less preferred\ndividends). www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n

To the extent\nthat a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to satisfy a\ntax withholding obligation of the Company may not be withheld\n(whether because the Award has not vested in full pursuant to\nits terms, administrative procedures in effect at such time,\napplicable accounting principles, or any other reason), it shall\nbe a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue shares\nof Common Stock upon the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or in\nsettlement of any vested Award, that a Participant pay to the\nCompany, on demand, such amount as may be requested by the\nCompany for the purpose of satisfying any actual tax withholding\n(or hypothetical tax) liability. If the amount is not timely\npaid to the Company in cash by such Participant, the Company may\ncancel the Award and refuse to issue such shares. 14. Repayment\nObligations and Right of Set-Off\n                                                                \n       If the Committee determines that all conditions to       \n       vesting and payment or distribution of an Award (or any  \n       portion thereof), or the vesting and exercisability of   \n       an Option or SAR (or any portion thereof), were not      \n       satisfied in full on the scheduled vesting date          \n       (including but not limited to, any Performance           \n       Condition), the Committee shall cancel such vesting and  \n       refuse to issue or distribute shares or cash and         \n       immediately terminate the Participant\u2019s rights with      \n       respect to such Award (or improperly vested portion      \n       thereof). If any such Award (or portion thereof) has     \n       already been paid, distributed, or exercised, the        \n       Participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to: (i) in  \n       the case of an improperly vested Stock Award, return     \n       the amount of any cash payment received in settlement    \n  (a)  of the Stock Award (or improperly vested portion         \n       thereof), or if settled in shares, the number of shares  \n       of Common Stock issued in settlement of the Stock Award  \n       (or improperly vested portion thereof), or make a cash   \n       payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of   \n       such shares on their vesting date, if greater than       \n       their Fair Market Value on the date they are due to be   \n       returned to the Company; or (ii) in the case of an       \n       improperly exercised Option or SAR, make a cash payment  \n       in an amount equal to the gain realized upon exercise    \n       of such Option or SAR (or improperly vested or           \n       exercised portion thereof), in each case, without        \n       reduction for any shares of Common Stock or cash         \n       withheld or paid to satisfy withholding tax or           \n       hypothetical tax obligations in connection with such     \n       Awards or any other obligation of the Participant.       \n       To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and      \n       consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the  \n       Code, if applicable, the Company will have the right to  \n       offset against its obligation to deliver vested shares   \n       of Common Stock or make any vested cash payment          \n       pursuant to any Award granted under the Plan: (i) any    \n       amounts paid by the Company or a Subsidiary to a third   \n       party pursuant to any award, judgment, or settlement of  \n  (b)  a complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which a          \n       Participant was the subject; and (ii) any outstanding    \n       amounts (including, without limitation, travel and       \n       entertainment or advance account balances, loans,        \n       repayment obligations under any Awards granted under     \n       the Plan, or awards granted under any other plan, or     \n       any obligations pursuant to a tax-equalization or        \n       housing allowance policy or other expatriate benefit)    \n       that a Participant then owes to the Company or a         \n       Subsidiary.                                              \n                                                                \n15. Other Benefit and Compensation Programs Awards granted under\nthe Plan and amounts received upon vesting or exercise of an\nAward shall not be deemed a part of a Participant\u2019s regular,\nrecurring compensation for purposes of calculating payments or\nbenefits under any Company benefit plan or severance program\nunless specifically provided for under the plan or program.\nUnless specifically set forth in an Award Agreement, Awards\nunder the Plan are not intended as payment for compensation that\notherwise would have been delivered in cash, and even if so\nintended, such Awards shall be subject to such vesting\nrequirements and other terms, conditions, restrictions, and\nlimitations as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

Unfunded Plan Unless otherwise determined by the Committee,\nthe Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed\nto create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall\nnot establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and\nany Participant or other person. To the extent that any\nParticipant holds any rights by virtue of an Award granted under\nthe Plan, such rights shall constitute general unsecured\nliabilities of the Company and shall not confer upon any\nParticipant or any other person or entity any right, title, or\ninterest in any assets of the Company. 17. Expenses of the Plan\nThe expenses of the administration of the Plan shall be borne by\nthe Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may require\nSubsidiaries to pay for the Common Stock issued under the Plan\nto Participants employed (or formerly employed) by such\nSubsidiaries. 18. Rights as a Stockholder Unless the Committee\ndetermines otherwise, a Participant shall not have any rights as\na stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by\nan Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of\nrecord with respect to such shares. No adjustment will be made\nfor dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior\nto such date, except as provided in Section 6(d) or Section 8.\n19. Future Rights No Employee shall have any claim or right to\nbe granted an Award under the Plan. There shall be no obligation\nof uniformity of treatment of Employees under the Plan. Further,\nthe Company and its Subsidiaries may adopt other compensation\nprograms, plans, or arrangements as they deem appropriate or\nnecessary. The adoption of the Plan or the granting of any Award\nshall not confer upon any Employee any right to continued\nemployment in any particular position or at any particular rate\nof compensation, nor shall it interfere in any way with the\nright of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment\nof its Employees at any time, free from any claim or liability\nunder the Plan. Unless expressly provided otherwise elsewhere in\nthe Plan or in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan shall\nbe made in anticipation of future service and/or subject to\nother vesting conditions and will not be earned until all\nconditions to vesting have been satisfied. 20. Amendment and\nTermination The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at\nany time by the Committee, provided that no amendment shall be\nmade without stockholder approval, if it would (a) materially\nincrease the number of shares available under the Plan (other\nthan pursuant to Section 6(d)), (b) materially expand the types\nof awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the\nclass of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d)\nmaterially extend the term of the Plan, (e) materially change\nthe method of determining the exercise price of an Award, (f)\ndelete or limit the Plan\u2019s prohibition against Repricing, or (g)\notherwise require approval by the stockholders of the Company in\norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York\nStock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the New\nYork Stock Exchange, the principal national securities exchange\nupon which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted). No such\namendment referred to above shall be effective unless and until\nit has been approved by the stockholders of the Company. The\nCommittee retains the right to modify an Award without a\nParticipant\u2019s prior consent if it determines that the\nmodification is required to comply with applicable law,\nregulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax\nlaw). Except as may be provided by Section 7(e), Section 11, and\nthis Section 20, any other adverse modification shall not be\neffective without the Participant\u2019s written consent. The Company\nshall furnish or make available to Participants a written notice\nof any modification through a brochure, prospectus supplement,\nor otherwise, which notice shall specify the effective date of\nsuch modification. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                \n  158  ANNEX B  \n                \n21. Successors and Assigns The Plan and any applicable Award\nAgreement entered into under the Plan shall be binding upon and\ninure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted\nassigns of Participants, including, without limitation, the\nexecutors, administrators, or trustees of a Participant\u0092s\nestate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or\nrepresentative of a Participant\u0092s creditors. 22. Governing Law\nThe Plan and all Award Agreements entered into under the Plan\nshall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws\nof the State of New York, except that any principles or\nprovisions of New York law that would apply the law of another\njurisdiction (other than applicable provisions of U.S. federal\nlaw) shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nmatters with respect to indemnification, delegation of authority\nunder the Plan, and the legality of shares of Common Stock\nissued under the Plan, shall be governed by the Delaware General\nCorporation Law. 23. Tax Compliance Awards granted hereunder\nshall comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code,\nunless otherwise determined by the Committee. If, pursuant to\nany Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a\nParticipant is entitled to receive a payment on a specified\ndate, such payment shall be deemed made as of such specified\ndate if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such\nspecified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year\nin which such specified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth\nday of the third month following such specified date; provided\nthat the Participant shall not be permitted, directly or\nindirectly, to designate the taxable year in which such payment\nis made. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to Section\n409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to a series of\ninstallment payments, such Participant\u0092s right to the series of\ninstallment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of\nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment. For\npurposes of the preceding sentence, the term \u0093series of\ninstallment payments\u0094 has the same meaning as provided in\nSection 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the regulations promulgated under\nthe Code. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the\ncontrary, in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary be\nliable to a Participant on account of an Award\u0092s failure to (a)\nqualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment, or (b)\navoid adverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law,\nincluding, without limitation, Sections 409A and 457A of the\nCode. 24. Severability If any provision of this Plan is finally\nheld to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable (whether in whole\nor in part), such provision shall be deemed modified to the\nextent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality,\nor unenforceability, and the remaining provisions shall not be\naffected thereby; provided that, if any such provision is\nfinally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable because it\nexceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit\nsuch provision to be enforceable, such provision shall be deemed\nmodified to the minimum extent necessary in order to make such\nprovision enforceable.
