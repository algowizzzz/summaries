(Citi) to exit  \n  its consumer franchises in 13 markets acrossAsiaandEMEA,      \n  Citi has decided to wind down and close its Korea consumer    \n  banking business. All necessary Citi-related Board approvals  \n  for this action were received by October 22, 2021. In         \n  connection with the wind down plan, Citi expects to incur     \n  significant wind down and related charges through the end of  \n  2023, consisting of cash expenditures related to voluntary    \n  termination benefits and related charges. Citibank Korea      \n  Inc. has begun negotiation of the voluntary termination       \n  benefits and related charges with employee unions, and is     \n  unable at this time to provide an estimate of the total       \n  amount or range of amounts expected to be incurred in         \n  connection with the wind down plan. Citi intends to file an   \n  amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K within four      \n  business days after it makes a determination of an estimate   \n  of the total amount or range of amounts expected to be        \n  incurred in connection with the wind down plan.\u200bCertain        \n  statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K are             \n  \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the rules  \n  and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange           \n  Commission (SEC).
