Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election\nof Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory\nArrangements of Certain Officers.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, the Personnel and Compensation Committee (the\nCommittee) of the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc.\n(Citigroup or the Company) approved, effective for 2020, a new\nannual base salary of \u00a31,000,000, up from \u00a3850,000, and a new\nannual fixed role-based allowance of \u00a35,500,000, up from\n\u00a34,478,000, for Paco Ybarra, the Chief Executive Officer of the\nInstitutional Clients Group of the Company (the CEO of ICG).\n\nMr. Ybarra\u2019s role-based allowance is based on certain guidelines\nrelated to the significance of his role and responsibilities\nwithin the Company and is designed to comply with U.K. and E.U.\nregulatory guidance. In accordance with that guidance, Mr.\nYbarra\u2019s annual incentive award must not exceed two times his\nfixed compensation (i.e., his base salary and role-based\nallowance) and Mr. Ybarra\u2019s entire incentive award is deferred\n(with no immediate bonus component). Consistent with Citigroup\u2019s\nexecutive compensation program as described in Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Proxy Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission on March 11, 2020, the Committee will\ndetermine Mr. Ybarra\u2019s 2020 annual incentive award (and,\ntherefore, total compensation for 2020) after year-end, based on\nfinancial and non-financial factors.\n\nThe changes in base salary and role-based allowance were made\nafter consultation with the Committee\u2019s independent compensation\nconsultant and are intended in part to allow for total annual\ncompensation in line with the market median for his current role\nas CEO of the ICG, considering compensation at U.S.-based global\nbanks, while complying with applicable regulatory guidance. The\nchanges are not reflective of, or dependent upon, 2020 Company\nor individual performance, and relate solely to Mr. Ybarra\u2019s\nrole and responsibilities with the Company. The changes in base\nsalary and role-based allowance do not imply an intent to\ncompensate Mr. Ybarra at the maximum level permitted under the\nU.K. and E.U. regulatory limits. Mr. Ybarra\u2019s annual incentive\nwill reflect performance.\n\nItem 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
