Due to the increases\nin regulatory capital\nrequirements, as well as\nmacroeconomic uncertainty,\nCiti has continued to pause\ncommon share repurchases as it\ncontinues to build capital.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress on its consumer\nbanking business divestitures\nin the current quarter,\nincluding completing the sale\nof its Philippines consumer\nbusiness, which resulted in a\nregulatory capital benefit of\napproximately $0.7 billion,\nand working toward closing the\nother five previously signed\nsale transactions and the\nwind-downs of Korea and Russia\n(for information on Citi\u2019s\nwind-down in Russia, see\n\u201cUpdate Regarding Citi\u2019s\nOperations in Russia\u201d below).\nAs previously announced, Citi\ncompleted the sales of its\nThailand and Malaysia consumer\nbusinesses on November 1,\n2022, which together are\nexpected to result in a\nregulatory capital benefit of\napproximately $1 billion.\n                                                                \n  Third Quarter of 2022 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $4.6 billion, or $2.15 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in net\nincome was primarily driven by\nhigher cost of credit\nresulting from loan growth in\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement (PBWM) and higher\noperating expenses, partially\noffset by the higher revenues.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas 20.0% in the current\nquarter versus 20.4% in the\nprior-year period (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cIncome Taxes\u201d below).\nEarnings per share (EPS)\ndecreased 24%, reflecting the\ndecrease in net income,\npartially offset by a 4%\ndecline in average diluted\nshares outstanding.\n\nResults for the current\nquarter included Legacy\nFranchises Asia Consumer\ndivestiture-related impacts of\napproximately $520 million in\nearnings before taxes\n(approximately $256 million\nafter-tax), primarily driven\nby the Philippines and other\nAsia consumer exits, which\nprimarily consisted of (i) an\napproximate $616 million\nPhilippines gain on sale\nrecorded in Other revenue and\n(ii) an approximate $107\nmillion of aggregate\ndivestiture-related costs,\nwhich, collectively, had a\n$0.13 positive impact on EPS.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was $1.50\nin the current quarter. Third\nquarter of 2021 results\nincluded Asia Consumer\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$(680) million (approximately\n$(580) million after-tax)\nwithin Legacy Franchises ,\nprimarily driven by a loss on\nsale of the Australia consumer\nbusiness. (As used throughout\nthis Form 10-Q, Citi\u2019s results\nof operations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof the Philippines gain on\nsale and other Asia Consumer\ndivestiture-related impacts\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nCitigroup revenues of $18.5\nbillion increased 6% versus\nthe prior-year period.\nExcluding the gain on sale of\nthe Philippines consumer\nbusiness in the quarter of\napproximately $0.6 billion and\nthe loss on sale of the\nAustralia consumer business in\nthe prior-year period of\napproximately $0.7 billion,\nrevenues were down 1%, as the\nimpact of higher interest\nrates across businesses and\nstrong loan growth in PBWM\nwere more than offset by\ndeclines in Investment banking\nand Markets in Institutional\nClients Group (ICG) and Asia\ninvestment product revenues in\nGlobal Wealth Management\n(Global Wealth).\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $646 billion, down\n3% versus the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation and lower balances\nin Legacy Franchises . The\ndecline in Legacy Franchises\nprimarily reflected the\nreclassification of loans to\nOther assets to reflect held-\nfor-sale (HFS) accounting, as\na result of the signing of\nsale agreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA,\nas well as the impact of the\nKorea wind-down.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were $1.3 trillion,\ndown 3% versus the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\ndeclines in Legacy Franchises\nand the impact of foreign\n                               3                                \nexchange translation,\npartially offset by the\nissuance of institutional\ncertificates of deposit,\nreflected in Corporate/Other ,\nas Citigroup continued to\ndiversify its funding profile.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $12.7 billion increased 8%\nversus the prior-year period,\nlargely driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and volume-related\nexpenses, other risk and\ncontrol investments and\ninflation, partially offset by\nproductivity savings and the\nbenefit of foreign exchange\ntranslation. As discussed\nabove, reported expenses\nincluded approximately $107\nmillion of divestiture-related\ncosts. Excluding these\ndivestiture-related costs,\nexpenses increased 7% versus\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndriven by the following:\n\n\u2022 Approximately 2% was driven\nby transformation investments,\nwith about two-thirds related\nto the risk, controls, data\nand finance programs\n(approximately 25% of the\nprogram investments were\nrelated to technology).\n\n\u2022 Approximately 1% was driven\nby business-led investments as\nCiti continues to hire\ncommercial and investment\nbankers as well as client\nadvisers in wealth, and\ncontinues to invest in the\nclient experience as well as\nfront-office platforms and\nonboarding.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 1% was driven\nby higher volume-related\nexpenses across both PBWM and\nICG .\n\n\u2022 Approximately 3% was driven\nby other risk and control\ninvestments and inflation,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings and the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi\nexpects to continue to incur\nhigher expenses during the\nremainder of 2022, compared to\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting ongoing\ntransformation-related,\nbusiness-led and other risk\nand control investments and\ninflation.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $1.4\nbillion, compared to a benefit\nof $0.2 billion in the prior-\nyear period. The higher cost\nof credit was driven by the\nnet build in the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) for loans\nand unfunded commitments of\n$0.4 billion, compared to a\nnet ACL release of $1.2\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by\nlower net credit losses. The\nnet ACL build was primarily\ndue to cards loan growth in\nPBWM and a deterioration in\nmacroeconomic forecasts\nprimarily impacting the\ncorporate portfolio. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $0.9\nbillion decreased 8% versus\nthe prior-year period.\nConsumer net credit losses\ndecreased 4% to $881 million,\nprimarily driven by Legacy\nFranchises (down 44% to $158\nmillion), partially offset by\nan increase in PBWM . The\nlower net credit losses in\nLegacy Franchises primarily\nreflected improved\ndelinquencies and the\nreclassification of loans to\nreflect HFS accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sale\nagreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\nThe increase in net credit\nlosses in PBWM was driven by\nRetail services (up 32% to\n$315 million),\n\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels,\npartially offset by lower net\ncredit losses in Branded cards\n(down 3% to $348 million).\nCorporate net credit losses\ndecreased to $6 million from\n$39 million in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 12.3% as of September 30,\n2022, compared to 11.7% as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income, the impacts\nrelated to the closing of the\nAustralia and Philippines\nconsumer business sales, and\nbusiness actions, including a\nreduction in RWA, partially\noffset by interest rate\nimpacts on Citigroup\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and the\nreturn of capital to common\nshareholders. The increase in\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio was\nalso partially offset by the\nimpact of adopting the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) on January 1, 2022.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of September\n30, 2022 was 5.7%, compared to\n5.8% as of September 30, 2021.\nThe decrease was driven by\nlower Tier 1 Capital,\npartially offset by a decrease\nin Total Leverage Exposure.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and\nrelated components, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $2.2 billion\ndecreased 30% versus the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by lower revenues,\nhigher expenses and modestly\nhigher cost of credit. ICG\noperating expenses of $6.5\nbillion increased 10%, driven\nby continued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation,\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings and\nforeign exchange translation.\n\nICG revenues of $9.5 billion\ndecreased 5% (including losses\non loan hedges) versus the\nprior-year period, as strong\nrevenue growth in Services was\nmore than offset by lower\nrevenues across Markets and\nBanking. Results included\nlosses on loan hedges of $56\nmillion, compared to $46\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nServices revenues of $4.2\nbillion increased 33% versus\nthe prior-year period.\nTreasury and trade solutions\n(TTS) revenues of $3.2 billion\nincreased 40%, driven by 61%\ngrowth in net interest income\nand 8% growth in non-interest\nrevenue. The strong\nperformance in TTS was driven\nby business actions, including\nbalance sheet optimization,\ndeepening of relationships\nwith existing clients and an\nincrease in new clients across\nsegments, as well as the\nbenefit of higher interest\nrates. Securities services\nrevenues of $968 million\nincreased 15%, as net interest\nincome increased 73%, driven\nby higher interest rates\nacross currencies, partially\noffset by a 6% decrease in\nnon-interest revenue due to\nthe impact of lower market\nvaluations.\n\nMarkets revenues of $4.1\nbillion were down 7% versus\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndriven by lower client\nactivity levels in Equity\nmarkets and spread products\nand business actions,\nincluding a reduction in RWA.\nFixed income markets\n                               4                                \nrevenues of $3.1 billion\nincreased 1%, as strength in\nrates and currencies was\nlargely offset by continued\nheadwinds in spread products.\nEquity markets revenues of\n$1.0 billion were down 25%,\nlargely reflecting reduced\nclient activity in equity\nderivatives relative to an\nunusually strong quarter in\nthe prior-year period.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.2\nbillion decreased 50% versus\nthe prior-year period,\nincluding the losses on loan\nhedges in the current quarter\nand the prior-year period.\nExcluding the losses on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues of\n$1.3 billion decreased 49%,\ndriven by lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending. Investment\nbanking revenues of $631\nmillion decreased 64%, as\nheightened macroeconomic\nuncertainty and market\nvolatility continued to impact\nclient activity. Excluding\nlosses on loan hedges,\nCorporate lending revenues\ndecreased 11%, driven by lower\nvolumes and higher hedging\ncosts.

PBWM operating\nexpenses of $4.1 billion\nincreased 13%, primarily\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol initiatives, business-\nled investments and volume-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nPBWM revenues of $6.2 billion\nincreased 6% versus the prior-\nyear period, as net interest\nincome growth, driven by\nstrong loan growth across\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices and higher interest\nrates, was partially offset by\na decline in non-interest\nrevenue, driven by lower\ninvestment fee revenues in\nGlobal Wealth and higher\npartner payments in Retail\nservices.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nof $4.3 billion increased 10%\nversus the prior-year period.\nBranded cards revenues of $2.3\nbillion increased 10%, driven\nby the higher net interest\nincome. In Branded cards, new\naccount acquisitions increased\n10%, card spend volumes\nincreased 14% and average\nloans increased 12%. Retail\nservices revenues of $1.4\nbillion increased 12%, driven\nby the higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by\nthe higher partner payments.\nRetail banking revenues of\n$642 million increased 2%,\nprimarily driven by the higher\ninterest rates and modest\ndeposit growth.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues of $1.9\nbillion decreased 2% versus\nthe prior-year period, as\ninvestment fee headwinds,\nparticularly in Asia, more\nthan offset net interest\nincome growth from higher\ninterest rates.

The amounts\nreclassified for the third quarter and nine months of 2021 were\n$293 million and $912 million, respectively .\n\n(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment\ndates. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n\n(3) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity. The return on\naverage total Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity is calculated using\nnet income divided by average Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For\ninformation on RoTCE and TBV, see \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Tangible\nCommon Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per\nShare and Return on Equity\u201d below.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s binding Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1\nCapital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach, whereas Citi\u2019s binding Total Capital ratio was derived\nunder the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both\nperiods presented. As of September 30, 2022, the Supplementary\nLeverage ratio and the Total Capital ratio under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches framework became more binding than the\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio under the Basel III\nStandardized Approach. Each of Citi\u2019s Basel III risk-based\ncapital and leverage ratios exceeded the respective regulatory\ncapital requirement by at least $19 billion as of September 30,\n2022. Citi expects the Basel III Standardized Approach capital\nratios to be more binding in future quarters due to the\nincreased Stress Capital Buffer in the fourth quarter of 2022\nand the additional GSIB surcharge in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n(6) Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net\nincome per diluted share.\n\n(7) Total common dividends declared plus common share\nrepurchases as a percentage of net income available to common\nshareholders ( Net income less preferred dividends).

performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include\nthe mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-\nmarket on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The\nfixed premium\n                               13                               \ncosts of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending\nrevenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup\u2019s\nresults of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n\nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of\naccrual loans and loans at fair value, which are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the\nreported results, see the table above.\n                                                                \n  3Q22 vs. 3Q21                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $2.2 billion\ndecreased 30%, primarily\ndriven by lower revenues,\nhigher expenses and modestly\nhigher cost of credit.\n\nRevenues decreased 5%\n(including losses on loan\nhedges), primarily reflecting\nlower Banking and Markets\nrevenues, partially offset by\nhigher Services revenues.\nBanking revenues were down 50%\n(including the impact of\nlosses on loan hedges),\nlargely reflecting lower\nrevenues in both Investment\nbanking and Corporate lending.\nMarkets revenues were down 7%,\nprimarily driven by Equity\nmarkets, partially offset by\nhigher Fixed income markets\nrevenues. Markets revenues\nwere also impacted by business\nactions, including a reduction\nin RWA. Services revenues were\nup 33%, driven by higher\nrevenues in both TTS and\nSecurities services.\n\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits Investment banking\nbusinesses will continue to\nreflect the overall market\nenvironment, including reduced\nlevels of capital markets and\nM&A activity, during the\nremainder of 2022.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 40%,\ndriven by 61% growth in net\ninterest income and 8% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\nreflecting strong growth\nacross all client segments.\nThe increase in net interest\nincome was driven by both the\ncash and trade businesses,\nreflecting benefits from\nhigher interest rates, balance\nsheet optimization and higher\naverage loans (9% increase).\nThe increase in average loans\nwas driven by the trade\nbusiness, reflecting strength\nin trade flows, primarily in\nAsia and Latin America,\npartially offset by asset\nsales in North America.\nAverage deposits decreased 1%,\nlargely driven by foreign\nexchange translation. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was primarily due to\nstrong fee growth across both\nthe cash and trade businesses,\nreflecting solid client\nengagement and healthy growth\nof underlying drivers, with\nU.S. dollar clearing volumes\nup 2%, cross-border flows up\n10% and commercial card spend\nup 49%.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 15%, as net interest\nincome grew 73%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased 6%, driven\nby lower fees in the custody\nbusiness due to lower assets\nunder custody (decline of 5%),\ndriven by declines in global\nfinancial markets. The decline\nin non-interest revenues was\npartially offset by continued\nelevated levels of corporate\nactivity in Issuer services.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 1%, driven\nby growth in rates and\ncurrencies in EMEA and Asia,\ndue to strong corporate client\nengagement, largely offset by\na continued decline in spread\nproducts, driven by North\nAmerica.\n\nRates and currencies increased\n18%, reflecting increased\nmarket volatility, driven by\nrising interest rates and\nquantitative tightening, as\ncentral banks respond to\nelevated levels of inflation.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\ndecreased 39%, due to\ncontinued lower client\nactivity across spread\nproducts and a challenging\ncredit market due to widening\nspreads.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 25%, driven by\nequity derivatives, primarily\nreflecting lower activity by\nboth corporate and\ninstitutional clients due to a\nstrong prior-year comparison,\nas well as a decline in equity\ncash, driven by lower volumes.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndeclined 64%, reflecting a\ndecline in the overall market\nwallet, as heightened\nmacroeconomic uncertainty and\nvolatility continued to impact\nclient activity. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 27%,\nreflecting a decline in North\nAmerica and EMEA, driven by\nthe decline in the market\nwallet. Equity and debt\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 79% and 82%,\nrespectively, reflecting a\ndecline in North America, EMEA\nand Asia, also driven by the\ndecline in the market wallet\nas well as a decline in wallet\nshare. The decline in debt\nunderwriting revenues also\nreflected markdowns on loan\ncommitments and losses on loan\nsales.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nwere $592 million versus $686\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, a decrease of 14%\nincluding the impact of losses\non loan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues decreased\n11%, primarily driven by lower\nvolumes and higher hedging\ncosts.\n\nExpenses were up 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\nproductivity savings and\nforeign exchange translation.\n\nProvisions were $86 million,\ncompared to $24 million in the\nprior-year period. Net credit\nlosses were zero compared to\n$31 million in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nThe ACL build was $86 million,\ncompared to a release of $7\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod.

higher\nrevenues.\n\nRevenues increased 6%,\nprimarily due to higher net\ninterest income, driven by\nstrong loan growth in Branded\ncards and Retail services and\nhigher interest rates. The\nincrease was partially offset\nby lower non-interest revenue,\nreflecting lower investment\nfee revenue in Global Wealth\nand higher partner payments in\nRetail services.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nincreased 10%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in Cards and\nRetail banking.\n\nCards revenues increased 11%.\nBranded cards revenues\nincreased 10%, primarily\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome on higher loan\nbalances.

Client assets\ndecreased 10%, primarily\ndriven by declines in equity\nmarket valuations. Global\nWealth continued to add client\nadvisors, which increased 5%.\nPrivate bank revenues\ndecreased 10%, Wealth at Work\nrevenues increased 6% and\nCitigold revenues increased\n2%.\n\nExpenses increased 13%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol initiatives, business-\nled investments and volume-\ndriven expenses, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $1.1 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $201\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by a\nnet ACL build and higher net\ncredit losses. Net credit\nlosses increased 13%,\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels,\nparticularly in Retail\nservices (net credit losses up\n32% to $315 million).\n\nThe net ACL build was $379\nmillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $843 million in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by U.S. Cards loan\ngrowth, partially offset by a\nrelease of a COVID-19\u2013related\nuncertainty reserve.

Net income\nwas $3.2 billion, compared to\n$6.1 billion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\nhigher cost of credit and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by higher revenues.\n\nRevenues increased 3%, largely\ndue to higher revenues in U.S.\nPersonal Banking. U.S.\nPersonal Banking revenues\nincreased 5%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in Cards,\nlargely driven by the same\nfactors described above.\nGlobal Wealth revenues\ndecreased 1%, driven by the\nsame factors described above.\n\nExpenses increased 13%, driven\nby the same factors described\nabove.\n\nProvisions were $2.1 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $928\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a lower net\nACL release, partially offset\nby lower net credit losses.\nNet credit losses decreased\n15%, driven by strong credit\nperformance across portfolios\nin the first half of 2022,\npartially offset by the higher\nnet credit losses in the third\nquarter of 2022.\n\nThe net ACL release was $34\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $3.4 billion in the prior-\nyear period. The net ACL\nrelease primarily reflected\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality and the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook in the\nfirst quarter of 2022,\npartially offset by net ACL\nbuilds in the second and third\nquarters of 2022 due to\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty and U.S. Cards\nloan growth.\n                               17                               \n                                                                \n  LEGACY FRANCHISES                                             \n                                                                \nAs of September 30, 2022, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia\nConsumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer\nbanking operations of the remaining 11 Asia and EMEA exit\ncountries (and Australia and the Philippines, until their sale\nclosings on June 1, 2022 and August 1, 2022, respectively; the\nThailand and Malaysia sales both closed on November 1, 2022, but\nbusiness activity was included in the results for all historical\nperiods in 2021 and 2022); (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico\nConsumer) and Mexico Small Business and Middle-Market Banking\n(Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, which Citi\nalso plans to exit; and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets (certain\nNorth America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets).\nSee Note 2 for additional information on the Philippines sale\nand other sales and exits.\n\nAsia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and branded\ncard products to retail and small business customers. Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and branded\ncard products to consumers and small business customers and\nprovides traditional middle-market banking products and services\nto commercial customers through Citibanamex.\n\nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its\nconsumer banking and local commercial banking operations in\nRussia, including its continued active pursuit of sales of\ncertain Russian consumer banking portfolios. In connection with\nthe wind-down plan, Citi expects to incur approximately $170\nmillion in costs (excluding the impact from any portfolio\nsales), primarily over the next 18 months, largely driven by\nrestructuring, vendor termination fees and other related\ncharges. On October 28, 2022, Citi entered into an agreement to\nsell a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment\nloans, totaling approximately $345 million in outstanding loan\nbalances as of the third quarter of 2022, to Uralsib, a Russian\ncommercial bank. In connection with the portfolio sale, Citi\nalso entered into a referral agreement to transfer to Uralsib a\nportfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to\ncustomer consents. The outstanding card loans balance was\napproximately $320 million as of the third quarter of 2022. For\nadditional information about Citi\u2019s continued efforts to reduce\nits operations and exposure in Russia, see \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d\nabove and \u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d\nbelow. In addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its\nconsumer banking businesses in Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Taiwan\nand Vietnam.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises\nhad 1,457 retail branches, $22 billion in retail banking loans\nand $50 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $8\nbillion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had\n$7 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. These amounts\nexclude approximately $17 billion of loans ($12 billion of\nretail banking loans and $5 billion of credit card loan\nbalances) and $20 billion of deposits, all of which were\nreclassified to Other assets and Other liabilities held-for-sale\n(HFS) as a result of Citi\u2019s agreements to sell its consumer\nbanking businesses in the above-listed countries.

The increase in\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio was\nalso partially offset by the\nimpact of the adoption of the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) on January 1, 2022.\n\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased under the Advanced\nApproaches from year-end 2021,\ndue to the interest rate\nimpacts on Citigroup\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio, the\nreturn of capital to common\nshareholders and the impact of\nthe adoption of the SA-CCR,\npartially offset by year-to-\ndate net income of $12.3\nbillion and the impact related\nto the closing of the\nAustralia and Philippines\nconsumer banking sales.\n\nFor additional information on\nSA-CCR, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d in Citi\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2022 Form 10-Q.\n                                                                \n  Stress Capital Buffer                                         \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, the Federal\nReserve Board finalized and\nannounced Citi\u2019s Stress\nCapital Buffer (SCB)\nrequirement of 4.0% for the\nfour-quarter window starting\nfrom October 1, 2022 to\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nAccordingly, as of October 1,\n2022, Citi is required to\nmaintain an 11.5% required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, incorporating this\nSCB and its current GSIB\nsurcharge of 3.0%. Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio under the\nAdvanced Approaches (using the\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) remains\nunchanged at 10.0%. The SCB\napplies to Citigroup only; the\nregulatory capital framework\napplicable to Citibank,\nincluding the Capital\nConservation Buffer, is\nunaffected by Citigroup\u2019s SCB.\n\nIn addition, as previously\ndisclosed, commencing January\n1, 2023, Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\nwill increase from 3.0% to\n3.5%, which will be applicable\nto both the Standardized and\nthe Advanced Approaches,\nresulting in a required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nof 12.0% under the\nStandardized Approach and\n10.5% under the Advanced\nApproaches, both as of such\ndate.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding regulatory capital\nbuffers, including the SCB and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.

As of September 30,\n2022, the Supplementary\nLeverage ratio and the Total\nCapital ratio under the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches\nframework became more binding\nthan the Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio under the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach.\nEach of Citi\u2019s Basel III risk-\nbased capital and leverage\nratios exceeded the respective\nregulatory capital requirement\nby at least $19 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. Citi\nexpects the Basel III\nStandardized Approach capital\nratios to be more binding in\nfuture quarters due to the\nincreased Stress Capital\nBuffer in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 and the additional\nGSIB surcharge in the first\nquarter of 2023.\n\n(3) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator.

DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit\nand general business credit tax carry-forwards are required to\nbe entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences\nare required to be deducted from capital only if these DTAs\nexceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(5) Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs\narising from temporary differences and significant common stock\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, this deduction related only to DTAs arising\nfrom temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. At\nDecember 31, 2021, none of these assets were in excess of the\n10%/15% limitations.\n\n(6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities that were previously eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing January 1,\n2022, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities have been\nfully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework were $4.9 billion and $4.4\nbillion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n                               24                               \n

Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated\nprobability of default for a counterparty and are derived by\nleveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and\nexternal agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in\ncombination with consideration of factors specific to the\nobligor or market, such as management experience, competitive\nposition, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of\ndefault of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given\ndefault of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal\nobligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are\nconsidered investment grade, while those below are considered\nnon-investment grade.\n                               35                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\nby facility risk rating as a\npercentage of the total\ncorporate credit portfolio:\n                                                                \n                     Total                                      \n                  exposure                                      \n                 September                         December     \n                       30,       June 30,               31,     \n                      2022           2022              2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A              50  %          50  %             48  %  \n  BBB                   33             33                34     \n  BB/B                  15             15                16     \n  CCC or                 2              2                 2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total                100  %         100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the obligor and\nfacility risk ratings assigned\nto all exposures, Citi may\nclassify exposures in the\ncorporate credit portfolio.\nThese classifications are\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the U.S.\nbanking regulators\u2019 definition\nof criticized exposures, which\nmay categorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful or loss. Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. Citigroup\nhas taken action to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2022,\napproximately 40% of PBWM\nconsumer loans consisted of\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices card loans, which\ngenerally drives the overall\ncredit performance of PBWM ,\nas U.S. Cards net credit\nlosses represent approximately\n90% of total PBWM losses. As\nshown in the chart above, the\nthird quarter of 2022 net\ncredit loss rate in PBWM was\nunchanged quarter-over-quarter\nand increased year-over-year,\ndriven by an increase in net\nflow rates, primarily\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels in\nU.S. Cards.

The portfolio\nis generally delinquency\nmanaged, where Citi evaluates\ncredit risk based on FICO\nscores, delinquencies and the\nvalue of underlying\ncollateral. The consumer\nmortgages in this portfolio\nhave historically been\nextended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than 80% on first and\nsecond mortgages. For\nadditional information, see \u201c\nLoan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios\u201d in\nNote 13. As shown in the chart\nabove, the net credit loss\nrate in Retail banking for the\nthird quarter of 2022\ndecreased quarter-over-\nquarter, due to industry-wide\nepisodic overdraft losses in\nthe first half of the year,\nbut increased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the\nlingering impact of the\nepisodic losses. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by U.S. mortgages,\nwhich reflected the lasting\neffects of government\nstimulus, unemployment\nbenefits and consumer relief\nprograms.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nAs discussed above, the Global\nWealth credit portfolio\nprimarily consists of consumer\nmortgages, cards and other\nlending products extended to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom the affluent to ultra-\nhigh-net-worth through the\nPrivate bank, Citigold and\nWealth at Work. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022,\napproximately $53 billion, or\n35%, of the portfolio was\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit\n\nrisk based on their internal\nrisk rating, of which 95% is\nrated investment grade. While\nthe delinquency rate in the\nchart above is calculated only\nfor the delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate for\nthe third quarter of 2022 were\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nreflecting the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nLegacy Franchises Legacy\nFranchises provides\ntraditional retail banking and\nbranded card products to\nretail and small business\ncustomers in Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer.\n                   \n  Asia(1)Consumer  \n                   \n(1) Asia Consumer includes\nLegacy Franchises activities\nin certain EMEA countries for\nall periods presented.

The net credit\nloss rate decreased year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the\nimpact of the charge-off of\npeak delinquent loans in early\n2021, which resulted in lower\ndelinquencies, leading to\nlower net credit losses in the\ncurrent quarter. The year-\nover-year decrease was also\ndriven by the reclassification\nof loans to held-for-sale\nduring the third quarter of\n2021 or thereafter (including\napproximately $12 billion of\nretail banking loans and $5\nbillion of credit card loan\nbalances for the third quarter\nof 2022), as a result of\nCiti\u2019s signing of sale\nagreements for the\nPhilippines, Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan,\nThailand and Vietnam consumer\nbanking businesses. The 90+\ndays past due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, primarily driven by\nlower end-of-period loans in\nKorea (decline of $3.3\nbillion) due to the continued\nwind-down of the business, and\ndecreased year-over-year,\nmainly driven by the impact of\nthe Asia held-for-sale\nreclassification and the\ncharge-off of peak\ndelinquencies.

As shown in\nthe chart above, the third\nquarter of 2022 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, largely driven by\nhigher episodic mortgage\nrecoveries in the second\nquarter of 2022, and decreased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the impact of the\ncharge-off of peak\ndelinquencies in early 2021,\nwhich resulted in lower\ndelinquencies, leading to\nlower net credit losses in the\ncurrent quarter. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the impact of the\ncharge-off of peak\ndelinquencies and higher\npayment rates.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $96 million ($0.6 billion), $119 million ($0.7\nbillion) and $146 million ($1.5 billion) at September 30, 2022,\nJune 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $67 million, $72 million and $78 million at\nSeptember 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021,\nrespectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed\nloans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless a notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, 95%,\n94% and 93% of Global Wealth classifiably managed loans were\nrated investment grade. For additional information on the credit\nquality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably\nmanaged portfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain\nEMEA countries for all periods presented.\n                               44                               \n(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and\nclosed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21, and closed on\nAugust 1, 2022) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan,\nThailand and Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional\ninformation.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $95 million ($0.3 billion), $84 million ($0.2\nbillion) and $138 million ($0.4 billion) at September 30, 2022,\nJune 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $31 million, $27 million and $42 million at\nSeptember 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021,\nrespectively.

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 68%, 52%, 66%, 56% and 58% of Citi\u2019s

Within non-\nbank, certain secured\nfinancing is also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Branded cards\nreceivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\ndeclined 2% year-over-year, as\ndeclines in unsecured\nbenchmark debt at both the\nbank and non-banking entities,\nas well as securitizations at\nthe bank, were partially\noffset by the issuance of\ncustomer-related debt at the\nnon-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding declined 2%,\nlargely driven by a decline in\nsenior debt at the non-bank\nentities, partially offset by\nan increase in FHLB borrowings\nat the bank. As part of its\nliability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs.

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $203\nbillion as of September 30,\n2022 decreased 3% from the\nprior-year period and\nincreased 2% sequentially,\ndriven by normal business\nactivity. The average balance\nfor secured funding was\napproximately $207 billion for\nthe quarter ended September\n30, 2022.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $47 billion increased 60%\nyear-over-year and 18%\nsequentially, reflecting an\nincrease in FHLB advances and\ncommercial paper issuance, as\nCiti continues to diversify\nits funding profile (see Note\n16 for further information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 outstanding short-\nterm borrowings).\n                               57                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.8\nbillion, compared to $0.7\nbillion as of June 30, 2022.\nOther funding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of September 30,\n2022, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.4 billion, compared to $1.2\nbillion as of June 30, 2022\n(see also Note 19). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, Citibank\nhad liquidity commitments of\napproximately $11.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $9.0 billion as of\nJune 30, 2022 (see Note 18 for\nadditional information).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               58                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\n\nportfolios. For additional\ninformation on market risk and\n\nmarket risk management at\nCiti, see \u201cMarket\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.\n                                                                \n  Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios                         \n                                                                \nMarket risk from non-trading\nportfolios stems predominantly\nfrom the potential impact of\nchanges in interest rates and\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s net interest income and\non Citi\u2019s Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) from its investment\nsecurities portfolios. Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from Treasury Risk\nManagement, a second line of\ndefense team reporting to the\nTreasury Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rate\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE)\n\nis a key metric that analyzes\nthe impact of a range of\nscenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modelling and other\nfactors.\n\nDuring the third quarter of\n2022, Citi transitioned its\nIRE analysis, employing\nenhanced methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nICG \u2019s Markets businesses).\nThese changes resulted in a\nhigher impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income over a\n12-month period (see the table\nbelow for details).\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities, (i.e., deposit\nbetas), are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nVAR.

The\nestimated impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income in a 100 bps\nupward rate shock scenario as\nof the third quarter of 2022\nincreased modestly quarter-\nover-quarter and decreased\nyear-over-year, primarily\nreflecting the net impact of\nlower expected gains due to\nU.S. dollar interest rate\nmoves that have already been\nrealized and changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet. At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity.

For other\ncurrencies, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 as compared to Scenario 3.\nThis is because the\ncombination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n\nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.6 billion,\nor 0.97%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency translation\nadjustment in AOCI , net of\nhedges. This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro, Singapore dollar and\nIndian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio, are shown in the table\nbelow.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of September 30, 2022, there were two\nback-testing exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in\nthe last 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. LIBOR Transition\nRisk The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act),\nenacted earlier this year, provides for the use of a statutory\nreplacement for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six month\nand 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR in all contracts governed by\nU.S. law that lack adequate fallback provisions. On July 28,\n2022, the Federal Reserve Board published in the Federal\nRegister its proposed rulemaking that would implement the LIBOR\nAct. The proposal contains the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nrecommendation of benchmark replacements for various product\ntypes. As required by the LIBOR Act, each proposed replacement\nrate is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).\nCiti continues to review the effect of the LIBOR Act and the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s proposal and monitor its ongoing\nrulemaking process, which is expected to facilitate the\ntransition to replacement rates for Citi\u2019s USD LIBOR-linked\nsecurities, loans and contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks\nbased on USD LIBOR that are governed by U.S. law and yet to be\nremediated.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 38% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (40% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n88% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 89% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

Effective from 2Q22,\nreverse repurchase agreements have been shown gross of\ncollateral and reclassified to net MTM on derivatives/repos in\nthe table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related\nreverse repurchase agreements was removed. This removal was due\nto the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the\nenforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system\nin the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical\nuncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was\nalready included in Total third-party exposure, the Total Russia\nexposure was not impacted by this reclassification.\n\n(3) Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending\ncommitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.\n\n(4) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the\nCentral Bank of Russia and have increased primarily due to\nborrower paydowns as risk mitigation activities have reduced AO\nCitibank\u2019s loan portfolio.\n\n(5) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and\npersonal banking clients.\n\n(6) Citigroup\u2019s currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss\nincluded in its Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\nrelated to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded\nfrom the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO\nCitibank and would be recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings upon\neither the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO\nCitibank. Citi has separately described these risks in\n\u201cDeconsolidation Risk\u201d below.\n                               75                               \nDuring the third quarter of\n2022, Citi continued to reduce\nits operations in Russia and\nRussia-related exposures,\nresulting in a net decrease in\nTotal Russia exposure of $0.5\nbillion, shown in the table\nabove, as well as a change in\ncomposition of exposure as\nmitigation efforts have\nreduced Citi\u2019s third-party\ncredit risk. Depreciation of\nthe ruble against the U.S.\ndollar resulted in a decrease\nin exposure of $0.7 billion,\npartially offset by a $0.2\nbillion increase in exposure\nin local currency terms,\ndriven by earnings plus\nongoing portfolio reductions,\nnet proceeds of which are\ndeposited with the Central\nBank of Russia.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued risk\nmitigation efforts include ICG\nborrower paydowns and limiting\nextensions of new credit. ICG\n\u2019s credit exposure also\nreflected a shift to a higher\nproportion of stronger credit\nnames, including a higher\nproportion of subsidiaries of\nmultinational companies that\nare headquartered outside of\nRussia, primarily in the U.S.\nand Europe. The decline in\noverall exposure was also\ndriven by a reduction in\nexposures to Russian\ncounterparties not held by AO\nCitibank.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $1.3\nbillion as of September 30,\n2022 (compared to $1.2 billion\nas of June 30, 2022). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby earnings generated by AO\nCitibank during the quarter,\npartially offset by\ndepreciation of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar. A\nportion of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment was hedged for\nforeign currency depreciation\nas of September 30, 2022,\nusing forward foreign exchange\ncontracts executed with\ninternational peer banks.\nGoing forward, Citi may record\ndevaluations on its net ruble-\ndenominated assets in\nearnings, without the benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposures. In the event of a\nloss of control of AO\nCitibank, Citi would be\nrequired to write off its net\ninvestment of approximately\n$1.3 billion (compared to $1.2\nbillion as of June 30, 2022),\nrecognize a pretax CTA loss of\napproximately $1.0 billion\nthrough earnings (compared to\n$0.9 billion as of June 30,\n2022), and recognize a loss of\n$0.3 billion (compared to $0.4\nbillion as of June 30, 2022)\non intercompany liabilities\nowed by AO Citibank to other\nCiti entities outside Russia\n(see \u201cDeconsolidation Risk\u201d\nbelow).\n\n3Q22 Earnings and Other\nImpacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses\n\nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments and\nCorporate/Other were impacted\nby various macroeconomic\nfactors and volatilities,\nincluding Russia\u2019s invasion of\nUkraine and its direct and\nindirect impact on the\nEuropean and global economy.\nFor a broader discussion of\nthese factors and volatilities\non Citi\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$1.2 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct and\nindirect Russian exposure\n(down from $1.6 billion at\nJune 30, 2022), consisting of\napproximately $0.5 billion\n(compared to $0.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2022) related to\nCiti\u2019s direct exposures to\nRussian counterparties and\napproximately $0.7 billion\n(compared to $0.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2022) related to the\nimpact of the war in Ukraine\non the broader global\nmacroeconomic environment.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer and local\ncommercial banking businesses,\nincluding actively pursuing\nportfolio sales. In connection\nwith the wind-down plan, Citi\nexpects to incur approximately\n$170 million in costs\n(excluding the impact from any\nportfolio sales), primarily\nover the next 18 months,\nlargely driven by\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, Citi\nentered into an agreement to\nsell a portfolio of ruble-\ndenominated personal\ninstallment loans, totaling\napproximately $345 million in\noutstanding loan balances as\nof the third quarter of 2022,\nto Uralsib, a Russian\ncommercial bank. Citi expects\nto incur a loss of\napproximately $35 million as a\nresult of the sale, which is\nexpected to close in the\nfourth quarter of 2022. In\nconnection with the portfolio\nsale, Citi also entered into a\nreferral agreement to transfer\nto Uralsib a portfolio of\nruble-denominated credit card\nloans, subject to customer\nconsents. The outstanding card\nloans balance was\napproximately $320 million as\nof the third quarter of 2022.\nCiti will refer credit card\ncustomers, who at the\ncustomers\u2019 sole discretion\nwill be eligible to refinance\ntheir outstanding card loan\nbalances with Uralsib.\n\nMoreover, Citi will be ending\nnearly all of the\ninstitutional banking services\nit offers in Russia by the end\nof the first quarter of 2023.\nGoing forward, Citi\u2019s only\noperations in Russia will be\nthose necessary to fulfill its\nremaining legal and regulatory\nobligations. At this time,\nCiti expects to incur\nestimated costs of\napproximately $100 million in\nconnection with this action.\nThe wind-down of the\ninstitutional banking business\ncould accelerate the\nsubstantial liquidation of AO\nCitibank, and therefore impact\nthe timing of the release of\nthe related CTA loss into\nearnings.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s operations in Russia\nsubject it to various risks,\nincluding, among others,\nforeign currency volatility,\nincluding appreciations or\ndevaluations; business\nrestrictions; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nExamples of triggers that may\nresult in deconsolidation of\nAO Citibank include voluntary\nor forced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nAs discussed above, in the\nevent of a loss of control of\nAO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to write off its net\ninvestment of approximately\n$1.3 billion (compared to $1.2\nbillion as of June 30, 2022),\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.0 billion\nthrough earnings (compared to\n$0.9 billion as of June 30,\n2022), and recognize a loss of\n$0.3 billion (compared to $0.4\nbillion as of June 30, 2022)\non intercompany liabilities\nowed by AO Citibank to other\nCiti entities outside Russia.\nIn the sole event of a\nsubstantial\n                               76                               \nliquidation, as opposed to a\nloss of control, Citi would be\nrequired to recognize the CTA\nloss of approximately $1.0\nbillion through earnings and\nwould evaluate its remaining\nnet investment as\ncircumstances evolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nits role as paying agent, Citi\nacts as an agent of its\nclient, the bond issuer,\nreceiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its current presence\nin Russia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\n\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of September 30,\n2022, these exposures amounted\nto $1.0 billion, unchanged\nfrom June 30, 2022, and were\nexclusively composed of third-\nparty assets held on the Citi\nUkraine subsidiary.\n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof September 30, 2022, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its\nArgentine operations was\napproximately $1.7 billion.\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar as\nthe functional currency for\nits operations in countries\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary under U.S. GAAP.\nCiti uses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net Argentine\npeso-denominated assets into\nthe U.S. dollar. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, the\nofficial Argentine peso\nexchange rate against the U.S.\ndollar was 147.34.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely to\ncontinue to increase as Citi\ngenerates net income in its\nArgentine franchise and its\nearnings cannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. However, if\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate converges with the\napproximate rate implied by\nthe indirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms, Citi could incur a\nloss on its capital in\nArgentina. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of September\n30, 2022, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge its Argentine peso\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net\nArgentine peso\u2010denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nany benefit from a change in\nthe fair value\n\nof derivative positions used\nto economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate ACL on\nits Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. However,\nU.S. regulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated\n\nBalance Sheet with the changes\nin fair value recognized in\neither the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.\n                               79                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nACL as of the third quarter of\n2022.

In\naddition, Citi reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost,\n\nincluding held-to-maturity\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowed, deposits with banks\nand other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the\n                               80                               \nability to forecast economic\nactivity over an R&S\ntimeframe. The R&S forecast\nperiod for consumer and\ncorporate loans is eight\nquarters. The ACL is composed\nof quantitative and\nqualitative management\nadjustment components. The\nquantitative component uses\nthree forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. Both the\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents are further\ndiscussed below. Quantitative\nComponent Citi estimates\nexpected credit losses for its\nquantitative component using\n(i) its comprehensive internal\ndata on loss and default\nhistory, (ii) internal credit\nrisk ratings, (iii) external\ncredit bureau and rating\nagencies information, and (iv)\nreasonable and supportable\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables that inform the\nforecasts, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other current economic\nfactors and credit trends,\nincluding housing prices,\nunemployment and gross\ndomestic product (GDP).\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect certain\nportfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as\nconcentrations, collateral\nvaluation, idiosyncratic\nevents and other factors as\nrequired by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent also reflects\nuncertainty around the war in\nUkraine and potential global\nrecession, considering\nmacroeconomic and market\nfactors, including inflation,\ninterest rates and commodity\nprices. The impact of these\nfactors to industries and\nsectors that are more\nvulnerable was considered.\nQualitative reserves also\ninclude the potential for\nnormalization in portfolio\nperformance and consumer\nbehavior, after record low\nlosses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity. Scenario\nProbability Weighting Citi\u2019s\nACL is estimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nweights are calculated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Changes in\nthese factors in future\nquarters will impact the\nweights assigned in those\nquarters.\n\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe base scenario assumptions.\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nmacroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL, including domestic\nand international variables\nfor its global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The\ntables below show Citi\u2019s\nforecasted quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate and\nyear-over-year U.S. Real GDP\ngrowth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL for each quarterly\nreporting period from 3Q21 to\n3Q22:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            4Q22       2Q23       4Q23       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.9  %     3.8  %     3.8  %         4.0  %  \n  at 3Q21                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.8        3.7        3.7            3.8     \n  at 4Q21                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.5        3.5        3.5            3.6     \n  at 1Q22                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.6        3.7        3.9            3.7     \n  at 2Q22                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.7        4.0        4.3            4.0     \n  at 3Q22                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. Real GDP                  2022       2023       2024     \n  Citi forecast                   3.9  %     2.1  %     1.8  %  \n  at 3Q21                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   4.0        2.2        1.8     \n  at 4Q21                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   3.3        2.4        2.1     \n  at 1Q22                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.6        1.8        2.0     \n  at 2Q22                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.6        0.6        1.9     \n  at 3Q22                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the Real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level.

Based on its latest\nmacroeconomic forecast, Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof September 30, 2022. See\nNote 14 for additional\ninformation.\n                                                                \n  Consumer                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. Cards\nin U.S. Personal Banking. As\ndiscussed above, Citi had a\nbuild of $0.4 billion in the\nACLL for its consumer\nportfolios in the third\nquarter of 2022, primarily\ndriven by U.S. Cards loan\ngrowth, which increased the\nACLL balance to $13.4 billion,\nor 3.74% of total consumer\nloans.\n\nFor U.S. Cards, the level of\nreserves as a percentage of\nEOP loans increased to 7.53%\nat September 30, 2022,\ncompared to 7.48% at June 30,\n2022. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to EOP\nloans was 1.3% at September\n30, 2022, compared to 1.2% at\nJune 30, 2022.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of $41 million in the\nthird quarter of 2022. The\nbuild was primarily driven by\na deterioration in\nmacroeconomic forecasts,\npartially offset by the\nrelease of a COVID-19\u2013related\nuncertainty reserve and\nreductions in Russia\nexposures. Including FX/Other,\nthe ACLL reserve balance\ndecreased by $21 million to\n$2.9 billion, or 1.04% of\ntotal corporate funded loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.1 billion in the third\nquarter of 2022, which reduced\nthe ACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $2.1 billion. The release\nwas primarily driven by\nreductions in Russia\nexposures, partially offset by\na build for a deterioration in\nmacroeconomic forecasts\nprimarily impacting the\ncorporate portfolio.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost of $0.1 billion\nin the third quarter of 2022,\nwhich increased the ACL\nreserve balance included in\nOther assets to $0.3 billion.\nThe build was primarily driven\nby a deterioration in\nmacroeconomic forecasts\nprimarily impacting the\ncorporate portfolio. See Note\n14 for additional information.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt September 30, 2022, the\nratio of the ACLL to total\nfunded loans was 2.54% (3.74%\nfor consumer loans and 1.04%\nfor corporate loans), compared\nto 2.44% at June 30, 2022\n(3.65% for consumer loans and\n1.00% for corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $2.9 billion at September\n30, 2022, down $149 million\nfrom June 30, 2022. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans of $1.4\nbillion at September 30, 2022\nwere unchanged from June 30,\n2022. Corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $170 million\nto $1.5 billion at September\n30, 2022, compared to $1.7\nbillion at June 30, 2022. In\naddition, the ratio of non-\naccrual loans to total loans\nwas 0.51% and 0.39% for\ncorporate and consumer loans,\nrespectively, at September 30,\n2022.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. After two\nyears with no impact on\ncapital, the CECL adoption\nimpact commenced phase in with\n25% of the impact (net of\ndeferred taxes) recognized on\nJanuary 1, 2022, with an\nadditional 25% to be\nrecognized on the first day of\neach subsequent year through\nJanuary 1, 2025. In addition,\n25% of the build (pretax) made\nin 2020 and 2021 was deferred\nand is being amortized over\nthe same timeframe.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 14 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually and\nconducts interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti had historically\nperformed its annual goodwill\nimpairment test as of July 1\neach year. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2022, the\nCompany voluntarily changed\nits annual impairment\nassessment date from July 1 to\nOctober 1. Based on interim\nimpairment tests performed\nwithin the period between the\nprevious annual test on July\n1, 2021 and the annual test to\nbe performed on October 1,\n2022, no more than 12 months\nwill have elapsed between\ngoodwill impairment tests of\nany of Citi\u2019s reporting units.\nThe change in measurement date\nrepresents a change in method\nof applying an accounting\nprinciple. This change is\npreferable because it better\naligns the Company\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment testing procedures\nwith its annual planning\nprocess and with its fiscal\nyear-end. Citi continues to\nmonitor each reporting unit\nfor triggering events for\npurposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The change\nin accounting principle did\nnot result in any, nor does\nCiti expect the change in\naccounting principle to result\nin any, delay, acceleration,\nor avoidance of an impairment\ncharge.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2022, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest due to the previously\ndisclosed changes in operating\nsegments and reporting units\nduring the quarter. The test\nresulted in an impairment of\n$535 million related to the\nAsia Consumer reporting unit\nwithin Legacy Franchises , due\nto the changes to Citi\u2019s\noperating segments and\nreporting units during the\nquarter, as well as the timing\nof mutual execution of sale\nagreements for Asia consumer\nbanking businesses.\n\nDuring the second quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting\nunit within the ICG operating\nsegment was negatively\nimpacted by the industry-wide\ndecline in investment banking\nactivity and macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties.\nThese conditions resulted in a\ncorresponding decline in the\noperating results of the\nBanking reporting unit as of\nJune 30, 2022, and\nqualitatively indicated that\nthe Banking reporting unit\u2019s\nfair value could be\ninsufficient to support its\ncarrying value, inclusive of\ngoodwill.\n\nAccordingly, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest for the Banking reporting\nunit as of June 30,\n                               82                               \n2022. This included completing\nan independent valuation of\nthe Banking reporting unit as\nof June 30, 2022, which\nconcluded that the fair value\nof the Banking reporting unit\nexceeded its book value,\ninclusive of goodwill. The\nresults of the impairment test\nshowed that the fair value of\nthe Banking reporting unit as\na percentage of its carrying\nvalue was 102%, with the\ncarrying value including\napproximately $1.5 billion of\ngoodwill. Therefore, no\nimpairment charge was recorded\nduring the quarter. No other\nevents or circumstances were\nidentified to indicate that\nthe fair values of Citi\u2019s\nother reporting units were\nmore-likely-than-not reduced\nbelow their respective\ncarrying amounts. During the\nthird quarter of 2022, Citi\u2019s\nBanking reporting unit within\nthe ICG operating segment\ncontinued to be negatively\nimpacted by the industry-wide\ndecline in investment banking\nactivity amid ongoing\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties as of September\n30, 2022, qualitatively\nindicating that the Banking\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value\ncould be insufficient to\nsupport its carrying value,\ninclusive of goodwill.\nAccordingly, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest for the Banking reporting\nunit as of September 30, 2022.\nThis included completing an\nindependent valuation of the\nBanking reporting unit as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, which\nconcluded that the fair value\nof the Banking reporting unit\nexceeded its book value,\ninclusive of goodwill. The\nresults of the impairment test\nshowed that the fair value of\nthe Banking reporting unit as\na percentage of its carrying\nvalue was 106%, with the\ncarrying value including\napproximately $1.5 billion of\ngoodwill. Therefore, no\nimpairment charge was recorded\nduring the quarter. No other\nevents or circumstances were\nidentified to indicate that\nthe fair values of Citi\u2019s\nother reporting units were\nmore-likely-than-not reduced\nbelow their respective\ncarrying amounts. Also, during\nthe third quarter of 2022,\nCiti performed an interim\ngoodwill impairment test on\nthe Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nreporting unit as of July 1,\n2022 to satisfy the\nrequirement that no more than\n12 months elapse between the\ntests for all reporting units.\nThe test resulted in no\nimpairment as the fair value\nof the Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nreporting unit was greater\nthan its carrying value. Based\non the interim impairment\ntests, the fair value of\nCiti\u2019s reporting units as a\npercentage of their allocated\ncarrying values ranged from\napproximately 106% to 267%,\nresulting in no further\nimpairment recognized as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. While the\ninherent risk related to\nuncertainty is embedded in the\nkey assumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture. See Note 15 for a\nfurther discussion of\ngoodwill, including key\nassumptions and related\nuncertainties that drive the\nfair value of the Banking\nreporting unit.\n\nLitigation Accruals See the\ndiscussion in Note 24 for\ninformation regarding Citi\u2019s\npolicies on establishing\naccruals for litigation and\nregulatory contingencies.\nINCOME TAXES Deferred Tax\nAssets For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s deferred\ntax assets (DTAs), see\n\u201cCapital Resources,\u201d \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d and\nNotes 1 and 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.

The increase from year-\nend 2021 was primarily a\nresult of losses in Other\ncomprehensive income . Of\nCiti\u2019s $27.1 billion of net\nDTAs at September 30, 2022,\n$11.7 billion of net DTAs\narising from net operating\nloss, foreign tax credit and\ngeneral business credit tax\ncarry-forwards, as well as\n$1.3 billion of DTAs from\ntemporary differences that\nexceed 10%/15% limitations,\nwere excluded from Citi\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nas of September 30, 2022. DTAs\narising from net operating\nloss, foreign tax credit and\ngeneral business credit tax\ncarry-forwards are required to\nbe entirely deducted from\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nunder the U.S. Basel III\nrules. DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences are\nrequired to be deducted from\ncapital only if these DTAs\nexceed 10%/15% limitations\nunder the U.S. Basel III\nrules. DTA Realizability Citi\nbelieves that realization of\nthe net DTAs of $27.1 billion\nat September 30, 2022 is more-\nlikely-than-not, based on\nmanagement\u2019s expectations of\nfuture taxable income\ngeneration in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ). Effective Tax\nRate Citi\u2019s reported effective\ntax rate for the third quarter\nof 2022 was 20.0%, compared to\nthe third quarter of 2021\neffective tax rate of 20.4%.\nTax Legislation The Inflation\nReduction Act, signed into law\non August 16, 2022, had no\nimpact on Citi\u2019s third quarter\nresults. The Act includes a\nnew corporate alternative\nminimum tax (AMT) and a 1%\nexcise tax on stock buybacks,\nboth effective January 1,\n                               83                               \n2023. The corporate AMT is a\n15% minimum tax on financial\nstatement income after\nadjusting for foreign taxes\npaid. Corporate AMT paid in\none year is creditable against\nregular corporate tax\nliability in future years.\nCiti does not expect to pay\nmaterial amounts of corporate\nAMT given its profitability\nand tax profile.\n\nThe 1% excise tax is a non-\ndeductible tax on the fair\nmarket value of stock\nrepurchased in the taxable\nyear, reduced by the fair\nmarket value of any stock\nissued in the same year.\n                               84                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nSeptember 30, 2022.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of September 30,\n2022 and for the three- and\nnine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021\ninclude the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded within Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2021, Citigroup\u2019s Current\nReport on Form 8-K dated May\n10, 2022 (as amended by a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K/A\ndated May 10, 2022) with\nHistorical Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Notes\nconformed to reflect changes\nin Citigroup\u2019s reportable\nsegments from those contained\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Annual Report\non Form 10-K included as an\nexhibit thereto (such Current\nReport on Form 8-K together\nwith Citigroup\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K,\ncollectively referred to as\nthe 2021 Form 10-K),\nCitigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2022 (First\nQuarter of 2022 Form 10-Q),\nand Citigroup\u2019s Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2022\n(Second Quarter of 2022 Form\n10-Q). Certain financial\ninformation that is normally\nincluded in annual financial\nstatements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required\nfor interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021\nForm 10-K for a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Voluntary\nChange in Goodwill Impairment\nAssessment Date During the\nthird quarter of 2022, the\nCompany voluntarily changed\nits annual goodwill impairment\nassessment date from July 1 to\nOctober 1. See Note 15 for\nadditional information.\nMultiple Macroeconomic\nScenarios-Based ACL Approach\nDuring the second quarter of\n2022, Citi refined its ACL\nmethodology to utilize\nmultiple macroeconomic\nscenarios to estimate its\nallowance for credit losses.\nThe ACL was previously\nestimated using a combination\nof a single base-case forecast\nscenario as part of its\nquantitative component and a\nqualitative management\nadjustment to reflect economic\nuncertainty from downside\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As a\nresult of this change, Citi\nnow explicitly incorporates\nmultiple macroeconomic\nscenarios\u2014base, upside, and\ndownside\u2014and associated\nprobabilities in the\nquantitative component when\nestimating its ACL. This\nrefinement represents a\n\u201cchange in accounting\nestimate\u201d under ASC Topic 250,\nAccounting Changes and Error\nCorrections , with prospective\napplication beginning in the\nperiod of change. This change\nin accounting estimate\nresulted in a decrease of\napproximately $ 0.3billion in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses in the second quarter\nof 2022, partially offsetting\nan increase of $ 0.8billion in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses due to the increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty and\nother factors in the second\nquarter of 2022. Accounting\nfor Deposit Insurance Expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of\n2021, Citi changed its\npresentation of the deposit\ninsurance costs paid to the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) and similar\nforeign regulators. These\ncosts were previously\npresented within Interest\nexpense and, as a result of\nthis change, are now presented\nwithin Other operating\nexpenses . Citi concluded that\nthis presentation was\npreferable in Citi\u2019s\ncircumstances, as it better\nreflected the nature of these\ndeposit insurance costs in\nthat these costs do not\ndirectly represent interest\npayments to creditors, but are\nsimilar in nature to other\npayments to regulatory\nagencies that are accounted\nfor as operating expenses.\nThis change in income\nstatement presentation\nrepresents a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle\u201d under\nASC Topic 250, Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections\n, with retrospective\napplication to the earliest\nperiod presented. This change\nin accounting principle\nresulted in a reclassification\nof $ 293million and $\n912million of deposit\ninsurance expenses from\nInterest expense to Other\noperating expenses , for the\nquarter and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021. This\nchange had no impact on Citi\u2019s\nnet income or the total\ndeposit insurance expense\nincurred by Citi.\n                               99                               \nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, FASB issued\nAccounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2022-3, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions. The ASU is to be\nadopted on a prospective basis\nand will be effective for\nCitigroup on January 1, 2024,\nalthough early adoption is\npermitted. Adoption of the\naccounting standard is not\nexpected to have an impact on\nCiti\u2019s operating results or\nfinancial position, as the\nCompany excludes such\nrestrictions when valuing\nequity securities. Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures In March\n2022, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . Citi will adopt\nthe ASU on its effective date,\nJanuary 1, 2023 (early\nadoption is permitted). The\nASU eliminates the requirement\nto measure the ACLL for TDRs\nusing a discounted cash flow\n(DCF) approach. Citi expects\nto discontinue the use of a\nDCF approach for consumer\nloans upon adoption, which\nwill result in an adjustment\nto the opening balances of the\nACLL and retained earnings.\nThe ASU will not affect the\nmeasurement of the ACLL for\ncorporate loans. Citi is\ncurrently evaluating the\npotential impact on its\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. The ASU also\nenhances disclosure of\nmodifications of loans made to\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and\nrequires that an entity\ndisclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of loan\norigination in credit quality\ndisclosures. The amendments\nrelated to disclosures are\nrequired to be applied\nprospectively beginning as of\nthe date of adoption. Long-\nDuration Insurance Contracts\nIn August 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2018-12,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nTargeted Improvements to the\nAccounting for Long-Duration\nContracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition,\nmeasurement, presentation and\ndisclosures for long-duration\ncontracts issued by an\ninsurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily\n\nin Mexico, that issue long-\nduration insurance contracts\nsuch as traditional life\ninsurance policies and life-\ncontingent annuity contracts\nthat will be impacted by the\nrequirements of ASU 2018-12.\nThe effective date of ASU\n2018-12 was deferred for all\ninsurance entities by ASU\n2019-09, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate (issued in October 2019)\nand by ASU 2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate and Early Application\n(issued in November 2020).\nCiti plans to adopt the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and\nis currently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on its\ninsurance subsidiaries.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in the second quarter\nof 2022. Out of the total CTA\nrelease, a $ 260million pretax\nloss ($ 221million after-tax\nloss) was attributable to the\nEgg Banking business noted\nabove, reported in\nDiscontinued operations , and\ntherefore the corresponding\nCTA release was also reported\nin Discontinued operations\nduring the second quarter of\n2022. The remaining CTA\nrelease of a $ 140million\npretax loss ($ 124million\nafter-tax loss) related to\nLegacy Holdings Assets was\nreported as part of Continuing\noperations within Legacy\nFranchises .\n\nWhile the legacy operation was\ndivested in multiple sales\nover the years, each\ntransaction did not result in\nsubstantial liquidation given\nthat Citi retained certain\nliabilities noted above, which\nwere gradually settled over\ntime until reaching the point\nof substantial liquidation\nduring the second quarter of\n2022, triggering the release\nof the CTA loss to earnings.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n                              101                               \nSignificant Disposals\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Citi has entered into sale agreements\nfor nineconsumer banking businesses that Citi intends to exit,\nincluding the sales of the Australia and Philippines businesses,\nwhich closed in the second and third quarters of 2022,\nrespectively. The sale agreements have resulted in a transfer to\nHFS over time of approximately $ 26billion in assets, including\napproximately $ 17billion of loans (net of allowance of $\n292million) and approximately $ 20billion in liabilities,\nincluding approximately $ 20billion in deposits. As a result,\nthese assets and liabilities held by each business were\nreclassified to HFS within Other assets and Other liabilities ,\nrespectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The total\namount of liabilities was $ 7.3billion including $ 6.8billion in\ndeposits. The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of\napproximately $ 780million ($ 650million after-tax), subject to\nclosing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue . The loss on\nsale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $\n620million currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) ($ 470million after-tax) already reflected in the\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component of\nequity. The sale closed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related\nbalance was removed from the AOCI component of equity, resulting\nin a neutral CTA impact to Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.\nThe income before taxes shown in the above table for Australia\nreflects Citi\u2019s ownership through June 1, 2022.\n\n(4) On August 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its\nPhilippines consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy\nFranchises . The Philippines consumer banking business had\napproximately $ 1.8billion in assets, including $ 1.2billion of\nloans (net of allowance of $ 80million) and excluding goodwill.\nThe total amount of liabilities was $ 1.3billion, including $\n1.2billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on\nsale of approximately $ 616million ($ 290million after-tax),\nsubject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue . The\nincome before taxes shown in the above table for the Philippines\nreflects Citi\u2019s ownership through August 1, 2022.\n\n(5) These sales are expected to result in an after-tax gain upon\nclosing.\n\n(6) Income before taxes for the period in which the individually\nsignificant component was classified as HFS for all prior\nperiods presented. For Australia, excludes the pretax loss on\nsale. For the Philippines, excludes the pretax gain on sale.\n\nCiti did not have any other significant disposals as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. As of November 4, 2022, Citi had not entered\ninto sale agreements for its two other consumer banking\nbusinesses to be sold in Asia and EMEA.

As part of the wind-down, Citi is also\nactively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking\nportfolios. In connection with the wind-down plan, Citi expects\nto incur approximately $ 170million in costs, primarily over the\nnext 18months, largely driven by restructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other related charges. These costs do not\ninclude the impact of any potential portfolio sales, should such\nsales be executed. During the third quarter of 2022, Citi\nrecorded a pretax charge of approximately $ 10million, composed\nof severance costs reported in the Legacy Franchises operating\nsegment. On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it will be\nending nearly all of the institutional banking services it\noffers in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going\nforward, Citi\u2019s only operations in Russia will be those\nnecessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory\nobligations. On October 28, 2022, Citi entered into an agreement\nto sell a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment\nloans, totaling approximately $ 345million in outstanding loan\nbalances as of the third quarter of 2022, to Uralsib, a Russian\ncommercial bank. Citi expects to incur a loss of approximately $\n35million as a result of the sale, which is expected to close in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022. In connection with the portfolio\nsale, Citi also entered into a referral agreement to transfer to\nUralsib a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans,\nsubject to customer consents. The outstanding card loans balance\nwas approximately $ 320million as of the third quarter of 2022.\nCiti will refer credit card customers, who at the customers\u2019\nsole discretion will be eligible to refinance their outstanding\ncard loan balances with Uralsib.\n                              103                               \n                                                                \n  3.

Citi reorganized\nits reporting into\nthreeoperating segments:\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) , Personal Banking and\nWealth Management (PBWM) and\nLegacy Franchises , with\nCorporate/Other including\nactivities not assigned to a\nspecific operating segment, as\nwell as discontinued\noperations. The prior-period\nbalances reflect\nreclassifications to conform\nthe presentation in those\nperiods to the current\noperating segment structure.\nCiti\u2019s consolidated results\nwere not impacted by the\nchanges discussed above and\nremain unchanged for all\nperiods presented. The\noperating segments are\ndetermined based on how\nmanagement allocates resources\nand measures financial\nperformance to make business\ndecisions, and are reflective\nof the types of customers\nserved and the products and\nservices provided. ICG\nconsists of Services, Markets\nand Banking, providing\ncorporate, institutional and\npublic sector clients around\nthe world with a full range of\nwholesale banking products and\nservices. PBWM consists of\nU.S. Personal Banking and\nGlobal Wealth Management\n(Global Wealth), providing\ntraditional banking services\nand credit cards to retail and\nsmall business customers in\nthe U.S., and financial\nservices to the entire\ncontinuum of wealth\nclients\u2014from affluent to\nultra-high-net-worth\u2014through\nbanking, lending, mortgages,\ninvestment, custody and trust\nproduct offerings in\n20countries, including the\nU.S., Mexico and the\nfourwealth management centers:\nSingapore, Hong Kong, the UAE\nand London. Legacy Franchises\nconsists of Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer/SBMM\nbusinesses that Citi intends\nto exit, and its remaining\nLegacy Holdings Assets .\nCorporate/Other includes\nactivities not assigned to the\noperating segments, including\ncertain unallocated costs of\nglobal functions, other\ncorporate expenses and net\ntreasury results, offsets to\ncertain line-item\nreclassifications and\neliminations, and unallocated\ntaxes, as well as discontinued\noperations.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that a decrease in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in higher payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 0and $ 28million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $\n59million and $ 75million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

due to settlement relate to divestiture activities.\n(3) The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under\nspecified Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\namended (ERISA), funding rules as of January 1, 2022 and no\nminimum required funding is expected for 2022.\n(4) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n                              111                               \n(5) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\nThe following table shows the change in AOCI related to

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 20 and 21. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost.\n\nThe election to measure a non-\nmarketable equity security\nusing the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.\n\nWhen the qualitative\nassessment indicates that\nimpairment exists, the\ninvestment is written down to\nfair value, with the full\ndifference between the fair\nvalue of the investment and\nits carrying amount recognized\nin earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 :\n                                                                \n  In millions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2022       December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value      $          1,690    $              1,413  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n  In                Three                      Nine             \n  millio\u2026          Months                    Months             \n  of                Ended                     Ended             \n  dollars       September                  Septemb\u2026             \n  Measur\u2026             30,                       30,             \n  altern\u2026            2022       2021           2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $         17    $     9    $        23    $    13  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   \u2014          \u2014              \u2014          \u2014  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   7         86            141        382  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                    September 30, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          103  \n  Downward changes for                                       3  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       831  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

During the quarter ended September\n30, 2022, the Company voluntarily changed its annual impairment\nassessment date from July 1 to October 1. Based on interim\nimpairment tests performed within the period between the\nprevious annual test on July 1, 2021 and the annual test to be\nperformed on October 1, 2022, no more than 12 months will have\nelapsed between goodwill impairment tests of any of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units. The change in measurement date represents a\nchange in method of applying an accounting principle. This\nchange is preferable because it better aligns the Company\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing procedures with its annual planning\nprocess and with its fiscal year-end. Citi continues to monitor\neach reporting unit for triggering events for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing. The change in accounting principle\ndid not result in any, nor does Citi expect the change in\naccounting principle to result in any, delay, acceleration or\navoidance of an impairment charge. As discussed in Note 3,\neffective January 1, 2022, as part of its strategic refresh,\nCiti made changes to its management structure, which resulted in\nchanges in its operating segments and reporting units to reflect\nhow the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, intends\nto manage the Company, allocate resources and measure\nperformance. Goodwill balances were reallocated across the new\nreporting units based on their relative fair values using the\nvaluation performed as of the effective date of the\nreorganization. Further, the goodwill balances associated with\ncertain Asia Consumer businesses within the Legacy Franchises\noperating segment were reclassified to HFS as of March 31, 2022.\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s divestiture activities.\nThe reorganization of Citi\u2019s reporting structure and the\nannounced sales of businesses within a reporting unit were\nidentified as triggering events for purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of ASC 350,\ninterim goodwill impairment tests were performed that resulted\nin an impairment of $ 535million to the Asia Consumer reporting\nunit within the Legacy Franchises operating segment, due to the\nimplementation of Citi\u2019s revised operating segments and\nreporting units, as well as the timing of mutual execution of\nsale agreements for Asia consumer banking businesses. This\nimpairment was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 as an\noperating expense. The interim goodwill impairment tests were\nperformed using a combination of the income approach, market\napproach and bids from buyers, where available, to determine the\nfair value of the reporting units. During the second quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting unit within the ICG operating\nsegment was negatively impacted by the industry-wide decline in\ninvestment banking activity and macroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties. These conditions resulted in a corresponding\ndecline in the operating results of the Banking reporting unit\nas of June 30, 2022 and were identified as a triggering event\nfor purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the\nrequirements of ASC 350, an interim goodwill impairment test was\nperformed that resulted in no impairment of the Banking\nreporting unit within the ICG operating segment. The results of\nthe impairment test showed that the fair value of the Banking\nreporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 102%,\nwith the carrying value including approximately $ 1.5billion of\ngoodwill. No other events or circumstances were identified for\nany other reporting unit as a triggering event for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing. The interim goodwill impairment\ntest was performed using a combination of the income approach\nand market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting\nunit. During the third quarter of 2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting\nunit within the ICG operating segment continued to be negatively\nimpacted by the industry-wide decline in investment banking\nactivity amid ongoing macroeconomic\n                              154                               \nchallenges and uncertainties. The presence of these conditions\nwas identified as a triggering event for the purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of\nASC 350, an interim goodwill impairment test was performed that\nresulted in no impairment of the Banking reporting unit. The\nresults of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the\nBanking reporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was\n106%, with the carrying value including approximately $\n1.5billion of goodwill. No other events or circumstances were\nidentified for any other reporting unit as a triggering event\nfor purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The interim\ngoodwill impairment test was performed using a combination of\nthe income approach and market approach to determine the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit. Also, during the third quarter of\n2022, Citi performed an interim goodwill impairment test on the\nMexico Consumer/SBMM reporting unit as of July 1, 2022 to\nsatisfy the requirement that no more than 12 months elapse\nbetween the tests for all reporting units. The test resulted in\nno impairment as the fair value of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nreporting unit was greater than its carrying value. The interim\ngoodwill impairment test was performed using the market approach\nto determine the fair value of the reporting unit. For the\ninterim impairment tests performed in 2022, the valuation of\nreporting units used either the market approach, income\napproach, or a combination of both. Under the market approach,\nCiti estimated fair value by comparing the business to similar\nbusinesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively\ntraded in public markets. Under the income approach, Citi used a\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model in which cash flows anticipated\nover several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that\ntime horizon, are discounted to their present value using an\nappropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent\nwithin the reporting unit. The key assumptions used to determine\nthe fair value of Citi\u2019s reporting units consisted primarily of\nsignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value inputs),\nincluding discount rates, estimated cash flows, growth rates,\nearnings multiples and/or transaction multiples of similar\nbusinesses or guideline public companies, and bids from buyers.\nThe DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate based on several factors, including\nmarket interest rates, and includes adjustments for market risk\nand company-specific risk. Estimated cash flows are based on\ninternally developed estimates and the growth rates are based on\nindustry knowledge and historical performance. Based on the\ninterim impairment tests, the fair values of all of Citi\u2019s other\nreporting units as a percentage of their allocated carrying\nvalues ranged from approximately 106% to 267%, resulting in no\nfurther impairment recognized as of September 30, 2022. While\nthe inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key\nassumptions used in the valuations, the economic and business\nenvironments continue to evolve as management implements its\nstrategic refresh. If management\u2019s future estimate of key\neconomic and market assumptions were to differ from its current\nassumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the future.\n\nIntangible Assets\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows:\n                                                                \n           Se\u2026

See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 75billion and $\n100billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 500million and $\n497million in maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, respectively.\n                              162                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party-\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 43.4billion and $ 55.6billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 and Note 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n20 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              163                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the\ntable below include those assets that can only be used to settle\nobligations of consolidated VIEs, presented on the following\npage, and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the\nassets in the table below include third-party assets of\nconsolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities in the table below\ninclude third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and\nexclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\nThe liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or\nbeneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit\nof Citigroup.\n                                                                \n  In millions of

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThese securities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021,\nCiti held noretained interests\nin private label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 5.3billion and\n$ 20.3billion, respectively,\nto re-securitization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n12.6billion and $ 37.1billion\nfor the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021,\nrespectively. As of September\n30, 2022, the fair value of\nCiti-retained interests in\nagency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by\nCiti totaled approximately $\n1.4billion (including $\n747million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2022), an increase\nfrom $ 1.2billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (including $\n641million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2021), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021\nwere approximately $\n76.0billion and $ 78.4billion,\nrespectively. As of September\n30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities.\n\nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits At\nSeptember 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the\ncommercial paper conduits\nadministered by Citi had\napproximately $ 15.6billion\nand $ 14.0billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 17.0billion\nand $ 18.3billion,\nrespectively. Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the\nweighted average remaining\nlives of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were\napproximately 65and 70days,\nrespectively. The primary\ncredit enhancement provided to\nthe conduit investors is in\nthe form of transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is\nstructured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement\nfeatures provided by the\nthird-party client seller,\nincluding over-\ncollateralization, cash and\nexcess spread collateral\naccounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These\ncredit enhancements are sized\nwith the objective of\napproximating a credit rating\nof A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements,\nthe conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained letters\nof credit from the Company,\nwhich equal at least 8% to 10%\nof the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.6billion and $ 1.3billion as\nof September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021,\nrespectively. The net result\nacross multiseller conduits\nadministered by the Company is\nthat, in the event that\ndefaulted assets exceed the\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above,\nany losses in each conduit are\nallocated first to the Company\nand then to the commercial\npaper investors.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e.,\nmarket risk), counterparty\nfailure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress\n(i.e., liquidity risk), as\nwell as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              172                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Gross\npositive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              173

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nChanges in the fair value of\nthe forward points (i.e., the\nspot-forward difference) of\nforward contracts are excluded\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and are\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in the fair value of\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the entire\nchange in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument is\nrecorded in earnings,\nCitigroup excludes changes in\nthe fair value of the forward\npoints (i.e., spot-forward\ndifference) of the futures\ncontract from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness, and\nthey are generally reflected\ndirectly in earnings over the\nlife of the hedge. Citi also\nexcludes changes in the fair\nvalue of forward points from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records them\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              176                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         7       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 was $\n23billion and $ 19billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 20billion and $\n16billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n1.3billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.1billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1.4billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n0.7billion and $ 2.9billion as\nof September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021,\nrespectively. At September 30,\n2022, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 0.7billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of September 30, 2022\nwas $ 22million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n30million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.9billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 13million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n58million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              182                               \n20.

Statements\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nFair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs\nbased on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes\nrules-based and data-driven selection criteria to determine\nwhether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level\n3: \u2022 The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is\nbased upon the frequency of observed transactions and the\nquality of independent market data available on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is\nobservability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The\ndetermination of whether an input is considered observable is\nbased on the availability of independent market data and its\ncorroboration, for example through observed transactions in the\nmarket. \u2022 Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.\n                              183                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis The\nfollowing tables present for\neach of the fair value\nhierarchy levels the Company\u2019s\nassets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on\na recurring basis at September\n30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a gain of $ 1,159million and a loss of $ 107million\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and a gain of $ 4,800million and a loss of $\n256million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes\nin instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by\nincorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable in\nthe bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to\nvalue each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option\nfor Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected\nPortfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell,\nSecurities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest revenue and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nrevenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n

above, $ 777million and $\n719million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended September 30,\n2022 and 2021 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\nlosses of $( 69) million and $( 10) million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its\ncommodity and foreign currency trading activities or to\neconomically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured\nliabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a\ndebt host contract and a commodity forward derivative\ninstrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt\nhost contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading\naccount assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\ntotal carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated\nprecious metals accounts was approximately $ 0.2billion and $\n0.3billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on\ntrading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of\nSeptember 30, 2022, there were approximately $ 16.4billion and $\n12.4billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

There was no net change in fair value\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes\nin the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in\naddition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest\nincome continues to be measured based on the contractual\ninterest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Debt Liabilities The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain debt\nliabilities. The Company elected the fair value option because\nthese exposures are considered to be trading-related positions\nand, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These\npositions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or\nderivatives classified as Trading account liabilities on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal\nform.\nThe following table provides information about the carrying\nvalue of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of\nrisk:\n                                                                \n  In billions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2022       December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest rate       $           45.2    $               38.9  \n  linked                                                        \n  Foreign exchange                 0.1                       \u2014  \n  linked                                                        \n  Equity linked                   37.0                    36.1  \n  Commodity linked                 5.1                     3.9  \n  Credit linked                    4.4                     3.7  \n  Total               $           91.8    $               82.6  \n                                                                \nThe portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes\nin Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a\ncomponent of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are\nreported in Principal transactions .

For\ncertain contracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n130billion and $ 119billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n                              207                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 15million and $ 19million at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and\nthese amounts are included in Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Card Arrangements with\nPartners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements,\nprovides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of\ncertain customer originations during the term of the agreement.\nTo the extent that such origination targets are not met, the\nguarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments\nthat otherwise would have been generated in connection with such\noriginations. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card\nProtection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses,\nprovides various cardholder protection programs on several of\nits card products, including programs that provide insurance\ncoverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated\nwith purchased products, price protection for certain purchases\nand protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not\nincluded in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At September 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, the actual and estimated losses incurred\nand the carrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these\nprograms were immaterial. Value-Transfer Networks (Including\nExchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or\nshareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs)\n(payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)\naround the world. As a condition of membership, many of these\nVTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of\nthe losses incurred by the organization due to another member\u2019s\ndefault on its obligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions\nto the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro\nrata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as\nthis would require an assessment of claims that have not yet\noccurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote\ngiven historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\nIndemnification Citi has an indemnification contingency to\nBrighthouse Financial in connection with Citi\u2019s sale of an\ninsurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification\nagreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial\nwould become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when\nboth the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust\nassets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However,\nshould events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and\ntrust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse\nFinancial\u2019s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to\neither estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range\nof loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to\naccrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and\nestimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential\nexposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-the-\nCounter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on\ncentral clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has\n                              208                               \ncontractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 17.4billion and $ 18.7billion as of September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Variation margin\ndue from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to\nclients, reflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member,\nCiti is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g.,\nfailure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for\nnegative changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi\nwould move to close out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would\ntypically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held\nby the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by\nCiti as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash\nor securities margin posted by the client, which would typically\nbe expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in\nthe event the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.5billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 58.3billion and $\n56.5billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 71.0billion and $ 84.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The\nmajority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized\nunder securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters\nof credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $\n3.6billion and $ 4.1billion at September 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively. Other property may also be available to\nCiti to cover losses under certain guarantees and\nindemnifications; however, the value of such property has not\nbeen determined.\n                              209                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nThe following information\nsupplements and amends, as\napplicable, the disclosure in\nNote 23 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of\nCitigroup\u2019s Second Quarter of\n2022 Form 10-Q and First\nQuarter of 2022 Form 10-Q and\nin Note 27 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K. For purposes\nof this Note, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. With\nrespect to previously incurred\nloss contingencies for which\nrecovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and\nuncertainties affecting\nrecognition are resolved. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At September 30,\n2022, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.2billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto\n\naccount its current accruals,\nthat the eventual outcome of\nall matters described in this\nNote would not be likely to\nhave a material adverse effect\non the consolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.
