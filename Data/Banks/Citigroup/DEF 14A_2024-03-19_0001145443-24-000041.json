This year\u2019s\nAnnual Meeting will be held in a virtual\nformat through a live webcast\nto facilitate stockholder attendance\nregardless of location and reduce\nthe carbon footprint of Citi\u2019s\nactivities. Details relating to the\nAnnual\nMeeting logistics are provided in this\n2024 Proxy Statement and at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CITI20\n24.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders will\nvote on a number of important\nmatters. Please take the time to\ncarefully read each of the proposals\ndescribed in the Proxy Statement.\n\nThank you for your support of Citi.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn C. Dugan\n\nChair of the Board\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n     \n  4  \n     \n2024 Board Letter to Stockholders\n\n2023 marked the second full year of Citi\u2019s execution of the\nmulti-year strategic and Transformation goals set forth at our\nlast Investor Day, in early 2022. Once again, despite some\nserious and unforeseen challenges, the Company made significant\nprogress in achieving these goals.\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge arose from the cluster of\nbank failures and resolutions that occurred in March 2023, with\nattendant concerns about the potential for contagion and\nsystemic risk. Here, Citi demonstrated the strength of its\ndiversified business model and prudent risk management. The\nCompany had deliberately managed its interest rate risk to have\nfar lower unrealized losses from the sharp rise in interest\nrates than those experienced by the banks that failed. It was\ntherefore able to play a central role, along with other large\nbanks, in providing support for the government\u2019s effort to\nachieve an orderly resolution of the problems, which in turn\nhelped restore depositor confidence across the system.\nNevertheless, the bank failures that did occur caused\nsubstantial deposit insurance losses, which large banks were\nrequired to cover through sharp increases in their deposit\ninsurance premiums, including a $1.5 billion expense for Citi in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn terms of its strategic goals, the Company continued its\nsuccessful divestitures of the 14 non-U.S. consumer businesses\nidentified at Investor Day. As of the date of this letter, nine\nof the businesses have been sold; three have been substantially\nwound down (Korea, Russia, and China); the Mexico consumer\nbusiness is on track for an initial public offering beginning in\n2025; and the Polish consumer business\u2014despite the war in\nUkraine\u2014is once again being offered for sale. Taken together,\nthese transactions continue to simplify Citi and significantly\nreduce headcount and expense.\n\nIn the wake of this progress on divestitures, the Company\nembraced its most significant structural changes since it\nannounced its strategy on Investor Day: it reorganized the firm\nto focus much more transparently on the five core businesses of\nServices, Markets, Banking, Wealth, and U.S. Personal Banking,\nthe heads of which now report directly to the CEO. The\nreorganization also eliminated previous regional structures and\nunnecessary layers of management, while establishing a\ncentralized Client organization led by a new Chief Client\nOfficer to enhance the focus of all Citi businesses on client\nservice. The new organization is plainly simpler, and its\ntransparency will increase accountability to you, our\nstockholders, for improved business performance.\n\nAs important as these changes are to Citi\u2019s future, their\nsuccess depends fundamentally on the multi-year Transformation\nof the Company\u2019s risk and control environment and data\narchitecture\u2014the number one priority of the firm. With most of\nthe planning and foundational work completed in 2021 and 2022,\nCiti\u2019s focus shifted to execution and improved outcomes in 2023.\nThe Company made substantial progress over the course of the\nyear, as evidenced by the retirement of roughly 390 legacy\napplications in 2023, thereby simplifying its technology\ninfrastructure and enabling greater focus on more strategic\nplatforms. The Company also launched a SMaRT platform for\nbooking controls in Markets to reduce manual trade entry errors\nby 85 percent across more than 50 trade order/entry systems.\n\nNotwithstanding this progress, enhanced performance will be\nnecessary to achieve expected improvements in data quality and\nregulatory reporting, which are key priorities for 2024. The\nBoard is keenly focused on the Transformation receiving the\nresources necessary for its successful completion.\n\nTurning to business performance, 2023 was mixed. The Services\nbusiness had a record year; Markets\u2019 performance was solid; and\nrevenues rebounded in U.S. Personal Banking based on\nsignificantly increased borrowing in Cards. At the same time,\nrevenues declined for both Wealth and Banking, but for both\nbusinesses Citi was able to attract strong new leaders to help\nimprove results going forward.\n\nOverall, the key metric of Total Stockholder Return showed\nmarked improvement year-over-year; the firm met its full year\nexpense guidance; and revenues increased to $78.5 billion. That\nsaid, Citi incurred a number of idiosyncratic expenses in the\nfourth quarter, and the Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE)\ndeclined to a disappointing 4.9 percent for the year.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n     \n  5  \n     \nLooking forward, and taking into account the strategic\ndivestitures, reorganization, and progress on the\nTransformation, management remains confident that Citi is on\ntrack to meet the medium-term financial targets set forth at\nInvestor Day, including achieving an 11-12 percent RoTCE. The\nBoard continues to believe that significantly improving RoTCE in\nthe medium- and longer-term is critical to improving Citi\u2019s\nTotal Stockholder Return\u2014and our oversight of financial\nperformance will continue to be focused on achieving that\nresult.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of Citi. Dialogue with\nstockholders is a fundamental feature of a well-governed\norganization, and we will continue to make it a priority. Please\nwrite with any concerns or suggestions to: Citigroup Inc.

The following\nsupplements that discussion by summarizing the principal\nexecutive compensation decisions we made for 2023. CEO\nCompensation The Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee (Compensation Committee) set Ms. Fraser\u2019s\ntotal compensation for 2023, her second full year as our Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO), at $26 million, consisting of a base\nsalary of $1.5 million and an incentive award of $24.5 million.\nIn setting the amount of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive award, the\nCompensation Committee took into account the 2023 results of\nCiti\u2019s strategic and operational efforts, Ms. Fraser\u2019s exemplary\nleadership, absolute and relative total stockholder returns for\n2023, including the various elements of Citi\u2019s executive\ncompensation program that tie compensation to total stockholder\nreturn, and an analysis of competitive market levels of pay for\nCEOs of peer companies. As Citi\u2019s CEO, Ms. Fraser has created a\nfirm foundation for great progress and transformative evolution,\nsetting the conditions for a period of substantial upside\npotential. While that potential is present, it has not yet been\nfully realized and reflected in our financial performance, but\nthe Compensation Committee believes that real progress has been\nmade. 2023 financial results are discussed on pages 78 and 79\nbelow. The Compensation Committee has seen positive change in\nthe organization because of Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership efforts. To\nstart with, the Compensation Committee notes Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nleadership in shaping certain changes in operational matters.\nThose efforts are complemented by Ms. Fraser\u2019s ability to\nenunciate an overall vision for the organization and to convey\nthat vision to multiple stakeholders. Regarding strategy, in\n2022, Ms. Fraser established a clear set of priorities for Citi\nto increase stockholder value over time: Citi\u2019s Transformation,\nStrategic Refresh, Improved Culture and Talent and most recently\nCiti\u2019s Organizational Simplification. Notwithstanding a\nchallenging macroeconomic environment for the banking industry,\nincluding persistent inflation uncertainty, regional bank\nturmoil, the U.S. debt ceiling crisis and geopolitical conflict\nand tension around the globe, under Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership in\n2023 Citi continued to deliver against its guidance and make\nsolid progress on each of our strategic priorities. As in 2022,\nMs. Fraser\u2019s incentive compensation for 2023 was delivered in\nthree parts. First, 35% was delivered in the form of deferred\nCiti common stock awards. Second, 15% was paid in cash at the\nbeginning of 2024. Third, the remainder of Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nincentive compensation was delivered in the form of Performance\nShare Units (PSUs). Overall, 85% of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive\ncompensation was equity-based, and 59% of the equity-based\ncompensation was delivered in the form of PSUs. Other Executive\nCompensation Citi has since 2013 delivered a portion of\nincentive compensation for our EMT in the form of PSUs. For\n2023, we expanded the use of PSUs in our compensation program by\nextending the use of PSUs to EMT members resident in the UK. In\naddition, our EMT was enlarged from 16 to 19 executives. Citi\n2024 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                          \n  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources  17  \n  and Management Highlights                               \n                                                          \nAs described more fully on page 93 below, the Compensation\nCommittee determined that 100% of the target number of shares\nsubject to PSUs granted as part of our 2020 incentive\ncompensation awards were earned for the three-year performance\nperiod from 2021 through 2023. This determination reflected the\ncapping of above-target financial metric performance because of\nnegative total stockholder return during such period. The\nresulting payout value was equal to 93% of initial value,\nreflecting the impact of both financial performance and total\nstockholder return, as compared to a zero payout for the prior\nperiod. To incentivize effective execution in connection with\nthe Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s risk\nand control environment and culture, in August 2021 the\nCompensation Committee approved a long-term performance-based\nbonus program (the Transformation Bonus Program). Following the\ncompletion of the first performance measurement period under the\nTransformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee\ndetermined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the\nperiod ending on December 31, 2022 would be 94%. Following the\ncompletion of the second performance measurement period under\nthe Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the\nPerformance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on\nDecember 31, 2023 would be 80%. In each case, the determination\nreflected the Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of performance\nrelative to preset targets. While Ms. Fraser is not eligible to\nparticipate in the Transformation Bonus Program, all other\nmembers of our EMT at the time the Program was adopted, as well\nas approximately 250 other employees who were deemed to be\ncritical to execution in connection with the Consent Order\nprograms, are eligible to participate. The metrics established\nfor the second performance period included execution, quality of\nexecution and culture change. Citi provides the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board on an\nongoing basis information regarding its plans and progress and\ncontinues to work constructively with these regulators to\nreflect their feedback on remediation efforts. Human Capital\nResources and Management Citi strives to deliver to its full\npotential by focusing on its strategic priority of attracting\nand retaining highly qualified and motivated colleagues. Citi\nseeks to enhance the competitive strength of its workforce\nthrough the following efforts: \u25cf Continuously innovating its\nefforts to recruit, train, develop, compensate, promote and\nengage colleagues \u25cf Actively seeking and listening to diverse\nperspectives at all levels of the organization \u25cf Optimizing\ntransparency concerning workforce goals to promote\naccountability, credibility and effectiveness in achieving those\ngoals \u25cf Providing compensation programs that are competitive in\nthe market and aligned to strategic objectives In 2023, Citi\nundertook significant changes to simplify the Company and\naccelerate the progress it is making in executing its strategy.\nAs previously disclosed, Citi aligned its organizational\nstructure to its business strategy\u2013making the Company more\nclient centric and agile, speeding up decision-making, improving\nproductivity to deliver efficiency and driving increased\naccountability across the organization.

Citi\u2019s\nLeadership Principles of \u201ctaking ownership, delivering with\npride and succeeding together\u201d have been reinforced through a\nbehavioral science-led campaign, referred to as Citi\u2019s New Way,\nthat reinforces the key working habits that support Citi\u2019s\nleadership culture. Citi\u2019s performance management approach also\nemphasizes the Leadership Principles through a four-pillar\nsystem, evaluating colleagues against financial performance,\nrisk and controls, and client and franchise goals as well as how\ncolleagues deliver from a leadership perspective. The\nperformance management and incentive compensation processes and\nassociated policies and frameworks have enhanced accountability\nthrough increased rigor and consistency, in particular for risk\nand controls. The culture shift is supported by changes in the\nway Citi identifies, assesses, develops and promotes talent,\nparticularly at senior levels of the Company. Citi promotes a\nnew class of managing directors each year. This is a testament\nto these individuals\u2019 performance and commitment to living our\nLeadership Principles and instilling them throughout their teams\nand the entire Company. Further, all potential successors to EMT\nroles are evaluated by the Board and are now subject to a risk\nand controls assessment. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nCitigroup\u2019s Board is committed to ensuring that the Board and\nCiti\u2019s EMT are composed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect\nthe diversity of Citi\u2019s employees, customers and other\nstakeholders. In addition, Citi has continued its efforts to\nsupport its globally diverse workforce, including, among other\nthings, taking actions with respect to pay equity, setting\naspirational representation goals and using diverse slates and\nhiring panels in recruiting. Citi\u2019s commitment to diversity,\nequity and inclusion continues to reflect a workforce that\nrepresents the clients it serves globally from all walks of\nlife, backgrounds and origins. Understanding that diversity\nfuels our culture and business success, Citi\u2019s 2025 aspirational\nrepresentation goals are embedded in its business strategy.\nHaving aspirational goals across all levels\u2013from early career\nthrough senior leadership roles\u2013will help ensure Citi not only\nhas diverse talent in leadership roles but will also help build\na diverse talent pipeline for the future. Citi 2024 Proxy\nStatement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                          \n  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources  19  \n  and Management Highlights                               \n                                                          \nThe Company constantly strives to ensure Citi remains a great\nplace to work, where people can thrive professionally and\npersonally. In 2023, Citi increased its unique Inclusion Network\nmembership by 23.8% and added 15 new global Inclusion Network\nchapters. The Company launched the Allyship 365 initiative,\nfocused on cultivating allyship year round and educating\ncolleagues on its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Citi\nvalues pay transparency and has taken significant action to\nprovide both managers and colleagues with greater clarity around\nCiti\u2019s compensation philosophy. Citi has introduced market-based\nsalary structures and bonus opportunity guidelines in various\ncountries worldwide, and posts salary ranges on all external\nU.S. job postings, which aligns with strategic objectives of pay\nequity and transparency. Citi also raised its U.S. minimum wage\nin 2022, the second broad-based increase in less than two years.\nIn addition, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay\nequity within the organization: \u25cf In 2018, Citi was the first\nmajor U.S. financial institution to publicly release the results\nof a pay equity review comparing its compensation of women to\nthat of men, as well as U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities.\nSince 2018, Citi has continued to be transparent about pay\nequity, including disclosing its unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for\nboth women and U.S. minorities. The raw gap measures the\ndifference in median compensation. The existence of Citi\u2019s raw\npay gap reflects a need to increase representation of women and\nU.S. minorities in senior and higher-paying roles. \u25cf In 2023,\ndue to its organizational and management simplification\ninitiatives, Citi paused its annual pay equity analysis, as the\nCompany continues the process of aligning roles to its new\norganizational structure. Citi looks forward to resuming routine\npay equity reviews once that work is complete. \u25cf For historical\ncontext, Citi\u2019s 2022 pay equity review determined that on an\nadjusted basis, women globally are paid on average more than 99%\nof what men are paid at Citi, and that there was not a\nstatistically significant difference in adjusted compensation\nfor U.S. minorities and non-minorities. \u25cf Citi\u2019s 2022 raw pay\ngap analysis showed that the median pay for women globally was\n78% of the median for men, up from 74% in 2021 and 2020. The\nmedian pay for U.S. minorities was more than 97% of the median\nfor non-minorities, which was up from just above 96% in 2021 and\n94% in 2020. Workforce Development Citi\u2019s numerous programmatic\nofferings aim to reinforce its culture and values, foster\nunderstanding of compliance requirements and develop\ncompetencies required to deliver excellence to its clients. Citi\nencourages career growth and development by offering broad and\ndiverse opportunities to colleagues, including the following: \u25cf\nCiti provides a range of internal development and rotational\nprograms to colleagues at all levels, including an extensive\nleadership curriculum, allowing the opportunity to build the\nskills needed to transition to supervisory and managerial roles.\nCiti\u2019s tuition assistance program further enables colleagues in\nNorth America to pursue their educational goals. \u25cf Citi\ncontinues to focus on internal talent development and aims to\nprovide colleagues with career growth opportunities. Of the\n44,600 mobility opportunities filled in 2023, 14% were open\nroles applied for and filled by internal candidates, and 38%\nwere filled by colleagues who applied for, and were promoted\ninto, new opportunities. These opportunities are particularly\nimportant as Citi focuses on providing career paths for its\ninternal talent base as part of its efforts to increase organic\ngrowth within the organization. \u25cf Citi enabled Development Plans\nfor colleagues of all levels. Last year, more than 100,000\nemployees completed a plan, setting a roadmap for how they can\nachieve their career aspirations. Well-being and Benefits Citi\nis proud to provide a wide range of benefits that support its\ncolleagues\u2019 mental, emotional, physical and financial well-being\nthrough various life stages and events. Citi is focused on\nproviding equitable benefits that are designed to attract,\nengage and retain colleagues. www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  20  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and    \n      Management Highlights                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has significantly enhanced mental well-being programs by\noffering free, accessible counseling sessions for colleagues and\ntheir family members, as well as offering an online tool so that\nall colleagues around the globe can easily find their local\nEmployee Assistance Programs and resources. Citi offers\ninstructor-led mental health training for people managers to\nequip them in supporting their team members. Citi also continues\nto value the importance of physical wellbeing\u2013providing\nemployees in several office locations and countries access to\nonsite medical care clinics, fitness centers, subsidized gym\nmemberships and virtual fitness programs. Citi continues to make\nmodern telemedicine programs increasingly available to\ncolleagues and their family members through programs like\ndigital physical therapy, which rolled out in the U.S. in 2022.\nIn 2023, one year after we became the first major U.S. bank to\npublicly embrace a flexible, hybrid work model, Citi fully\nimplemented it across the organization. Most of Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues now work in hybrid roles, working remotely up to two\ndays a week. How We Work provides the majority of Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues with the ability to balance the demands of their home\nlives with the work commitments that are necessary for success.\nThe program includes three role designations for colleagues\nglobally: Resident, Hybrid or Remote. The implementation and\ncontinuation of this program differentiates Citi from other\nfinancial organizations with respect to flexible working\narrangements. By embracing a flexible model of work, Citi has\nfocused on keeping its approach consistent and aligned with its\nvalues and priorities.

The full text\nof the Guidelines,\nas approved by the Board, is set forth on Citi\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com. Click on \u201cInvestors,\u201d then \u201cCorporate\nGovernance,\u201d and then \u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines.\u201d The\nGuidelines outline the responsibilities, operations,\nqualifications,\nand composition of the Board. The following summarizes certain\nprovisions of the Guidelines.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nOur goal is that at least two-thirds of the members\nof the Board be independent. Descriptions of our independence\ncriteria and the results of the Board\u2019s independence\ndeterminations\nare set forth below.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nThe Guidelines require that all members of the following\ncommittees of the Board be independent: Audit; Compensation,\nPerformance Management and Culture; and Nomination, Governance\nand Public\nAffairs. Committee members are appointed by the Board upon the\nrecommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee.\nCommittee membership and Chairs are rotated periodically.

Members of the Audit Committee may not serve on\nmore\nthan three public company audit committees, including Citi\u2019s\nAudit Committee. The number of other for-profit public and non-\npublic\ncompany boards and not-for-profit boards on which a Director may\nserve, including leadership positions on such for-profit and\nnot-for-profit\nboards, is subject to review and approval by the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee, in order to ensure that\neach Director\nis able to devote sufficient time to performing his or her\nduties as a Director. This review is performed annually and the\nfull Board,\nbased on a recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee, determines whether each Nominee can,\nbased on his\nor her outside board commitments, including committee\nmemberships and leadership positions, devote sufficient time to\nperforming his or\nher duties as a Director of Citi. In addition to the annual\nreview, if a director is considering joining a for-profit board,\nthe Director\nmust advise the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee, which will consider whether, after joining such board\nand any of\nits committees, as well as assuming any leadership positions,\nthe Director can continue to devote sufficient time to\nperforming his or\nher duties as a Director of Citi. In addition, under the\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, Board members are required to\ndisclose significant\nchanges in professional responsibilities, including assuming a\nsignificant role in a not-for-profit entity, to the Nomination,\nGovernance\nand Public Affairs Committee for consideration.\n\nNo Board nominee serves on more than four for-profit public\ncompany boards and no Audit Committee member serves on more than\nthree public company audit committees. Our CEO does not sit on\nany for-profit company boards besides Citi. For the 2024 slate\nof nominees for Citi\u2019s Board, Citi\u2019s Board of Directors, based\non a\nrecommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee, has determined, that upon consideration of the number\nof for-profit\npublic and non-public company boards and not-for-profit boards\non which each Director serves, including committee memberships\nand leadership\npositions on each of such for-profit and not-for-profit boards,\nthat each nominee is able to devote sufficient time to\nperforming his\nor her duties as a Director of Citi.\n\nChange in Status or Responsibilities\n\nIf a Director has a substantial change in professional\nresponsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she\nis required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee\nand to offer his or her resignation from the Board. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will\nevaluate the facts and\ncircumstances and make a recommendation to the Board whether to\naccept the resignation or request that the Director continue to\nserve\non the Board. If a Director assumes a significant role in a not-\nfor-profit entity, he or she is asked to notify the Nomination,\nGovernance\nand Public Affairs Committee.\n\nAttendance at Meetings\n\nDirectors are expected to attend Board meetings and\nmeetings of the Committees on which they serve, and the Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders. All of the Directors then in office\nattended Citi\u2019s\n2023 Virtual Annual Meeting.\n\nEvaluation of Board Performance\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nconducts an annual review of Board performance in which the full\nBoard participates, and each standing committee (except for the\nExecutive\nCommittee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part of the\nself-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of its own\nperformance\nof its obligations with regard to such matters as regulatory\nrequirements, strategic and financial oversight, oversight of\nrisk management,\nexecutive compensation, succession planning, and governance,\namong many other topics. The committees evaluate their\nperformance against\nthe requirements of their charters and other aspects of their\nresponsibilities. The Board Chair conducts one-on-one interviews\nwith each\nboard member. The full Board and each committee then discuss the\nresults of their respective self-evaluations in executive\nsession, highlighting\nactions to be taken in response to the discussion. See Board\nSelf-Assessment Process on page 30 for further information.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  24  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nDirectors Access to Senior Management and Director\nOrientation\n\nDirectors have full and free access to senior management\nand other employees of Citi. New Directors are provided with an\norientation program to familiarize them with Citi\u2019s businesses\nand\nfunctions, as well as its legal, compliance, regulatory, and\nrisk profile. Citi provides educational sessions on a variety of\ntopics throughout\nthe year for all members of the Board. These sessions are\ndesigned to allow Directors to develop a deeper understanding\nof, for example,\na business issue or a complex financial product.\n\nSuccession Planning\n\nThe Board reviews the Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee\u2019s report on the\nperformance of senior executives to evaluate whether they are\nproviding the highest quality leadership for Citi. The\nBoard also works with the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee to evaluate potential successors\nto the CEO. With respect to regular succession of the CEO and\nsenior management, Citi\u2019s Board evaluates internal,\nand, when appropriate, external candidates. To find external\ncandidates, Citi seeks input from the members of the\nBoard, senior management, and from recruiting firms. To develop\ninternal candidates, Citi engages in a number\nof practices, formal and informal, designed to familiarize the\nBoard with Citi\u2019s talent pool. The formal process\ninvolves an annual talent review conducted by senior management\nat which the Board studies the most promising\nmembers of senior management. The Board learns about each\nperson\u2019s experience, skills, areas of expertise,\naccomplishments, and goals. This review is conducted at a\nregularly scheduled Board meeting on an annual basis.\nIn addition, members of senior management are periodically asked\nto make presentations to the Board at Board\nmeetings and Board strategy sessions. These presentations are\nmade by senior managers of the various business\nunits as well as those who serve in corporate functions. The\npurpose of the formal review and other interaction is to\nfamiliarize Board members with the talent pool inside and\noutside Citi from which the Board would be able to choose\nsuccessors to the CEO and evaluate succession for other senior\nmanagers as necessary from time to time.\n\nCharitable Contributions\n\nIf a Director, or an immediate family member who shares\nthe Director\u2019s household, serves as a director, trustee, or\nexecutive officer of a foundation, university, or other not-for-\nprofit\norganization, and such entity receives contributions from Citi\nand/or the Citi Foundation, such contributions must be reported\nto the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least\nannually.\n\nInsider Investments and Transactions\n\nMembers of Citi\u2019s Board of Directors and Citi\u2019s\nexecutive officers (i.e., Section 16 Insiders) are not permitted\nto hedge their Citi securities or to pledge their Citi\nsecurities as\ncollateral for a loan. The Guidelines restrict certain financial\ntransactions between Citi and its subsidiaries on the one hand\nand Directors,\nsenior management, and their immediate family members on the\nother. Personal loans from Citi or its subsidiaries to Citi\u2019s\nDirectors\nand its most senior executives, or immediate family members who\nshare any such person\u2019s household, are prohibited, except for\nmargin\nloans to employees of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi,\nmortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans, credit cards,\nand overdraft\nchecking privileges, all made on market terms in the ordinary\ncourse of business.

Directors and those\nimmediate family members who share the Director\u2019s household are\nnot\npermitted to receive initial public offering allocations.\nDirectors and their immediate family members may participate in\nCiti-sponsored\ninvestment activities, provided they are offered on the same\nterms as those offered to similarly situated non-affiliated\npersons. Under\ncertain circumstances, or with the approval of the appropriate\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  Corporate Governance  25  \n                            \ncommittee, members of senior management may participate\nin certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities. Finally,\nthere is a prohibition on certain investments by Directors and\nexecutive\nofficers in third-party entities when the opportunity comes\nsolely as a result of their position with Citi.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nThe Board has adopted categorical standards to assist\nthe Board in evaluating the independence of each of its\nDirectors. The categorical standards, which are set forth below,\ndescribe various\ntypes of relationships that could potentially exist between a\nDirector or an immediate family member of a Director and Citi,\nand set thresholds\nat which such relationships would be deemed to be material.\nProvided that no relationship or transaction exists that would\ndisqualify\na Director under the categorical standards and no other\nrelationships or transactions exist of a type not specifically\nmentioned in the\ncategorical standards that, in the Board\u2019s opinion, taking into\naccount all facts and circumstances, would impair a Director\u2019s\nability to exercise his or her independent judgment, the Board\nwill deem such person to be independent.\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee reviewed certain information obtained from Directors\u2019\nresponses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships\nwith Citi, and those of their immediate family members and\nprimary business or charitable affiliations and other potential\nconflicts\nof interest, as well as certain data collected by Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses related to transactions, relationships, or\narrangements\nbetween Citi on the one hand and a Director, immediate family\nmember of a Director, or a primary business or charitable\naffiliation\nof a Director, on the other. The Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee also reviewed certain relationships or\ntransactions between the Directors or immediate family members\nof the Directors or their primary business or charitable\naffiliations\nand Citi and determined that the relationships or transactions\ncomplied with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the\nrelated\ncategorical standards. The Board, based on the recommendation of\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee,\ndetermined\nthat, applying the Guidelines and standards, which are intended\nto comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules, and all\nother\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations, each of the following\nDirector nominees standing for re-election is independent:\n                                                \n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ellen    \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Duncan     \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gary       \n  M.

Definitions For purposes of these Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, (i) the term \u201cimmediate family member\u201d\nmeans a Director\u2019s or executive officer\u2019s (designated as such\npursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (Exchange Act)) spouse, parents, step-parents,\nchildren, step-children, siblings, mother- and father-in law,\nsons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and\nany person (other than a tenant or domestic employee) who shares\nthe Director\u2019s household; (ii) the term \u201cPrimary Business\nAffiliation\u201d means an entity of which the Director or executive\nofficer, or an immediate family member of such a person, is an\nofficer, partner or employee or in which the Director, executive\nofficer or immediate family member owns directly or indirectly\nat least a 5% equity interest; and (iii) the term \u201cRelated Party\nTransaction\u201d means any financial transaction, arrangement or\nrelationship in which (a) the aggregate amount involved will or\nmay be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (b) Citi\nis a participant, and (c) any Related Person (any Director, any\nexecutive officer of Citi, any nominee for Director, any\nshareholder owning in excess of 5% of the total equity of Citi,\nand any immediate family member of any such person) has or will\nhave a direct or indirect material interest.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  28  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nMeetings of the Board of Directors and Committees\n\nThe Board of Directors met 24 times in 2023. Citi\u2019s\nstanding Board Committees met as follows: the Audit Committee\nmet 20 times, the Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee\nmet 12 times, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee met 7 times, the Risk Management Committee met 16\ntimes, and the\nTechnology Committee met 10 times. The Executive Committee did\nnot meet in 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, all independent members of the\nBoard served on and/or chaired one or more ad hoc committees,\nincluding the Transformation Oversight Committee, or served on\nan international\nsubsidiary board. In addition, Mses. Dailey, Desoer, Fraser,\nIreland, and Taylor and Messrs. Hennes and Turley served on the\nBoard of\nDirectors of Citibank, N.A., which is a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Citi.\n\nEach incumbent Director attended at least 88% of the\nmeetings of the Board and of the standing committees of which he\nor she was a member during 2023.\n\nMeetings of Non-Management Directors\n\nCiti\u2019s non-management Directors meet in executive\nsession without any management Directors in attendance whenever\nthe full Board convenes for a regularly scheduled meeting.\nDuring 2023,\nMr. Dugan presided at each executive session of the non-\nmanagement Directors.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\nCiti currently has an independent Chair separate from the CEO, a\nstructure that has been in place since 2009. The Board believes \nit is important to maintain flexibility in its Board leadership \nstructure and has had in place different leadership structures  \nin the past, depending on the Company\u2019s needs at the time, but  \nfirmly supports having an independent Director in a Board       \nleadership position at all times. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s Board, on \nDecember 15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment that provides that\nif Citi does not have an Independent Chair, the Board will elect\na lead independent Director having similar duties to an         \nindependent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of  \nthe non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Chair    \nprovides independent leadership of the Board.Having an          \nindependent Chair or Lead Director enables non-management       \nDirectors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration  \nwithout immediately involving management. The Chair or Lead     \nDirector also serves as a liaison between the Board and senior  \nmanagement and regularly meets with Citi\u2019s stockholders,        \nstakeholders, and regulators on behalf of the Company. Citi\u2019s   \nBoard has determined that the current structure, an independent \nChair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure  \nat this time, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be  \nan independent Director in a Board leadership position. The     \nBoard believes its approach to risk oversight, which includes:  \n(i) a report at every regular Board meeting from the Chief Risk \nOfficer on significant risk matters for discussion with the     \nBoard, (ii) a standing Risk Management Committee of the Board   \nand (iii) a direct reporting line of the Chief Risk Officer to  \nthe Risk Management Committee, that enables the Board to choose \nmany leadership structures without experiencing a material      \nimpact on its oversight of risk.                                \n                                                                \nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  Corporate Governance  29  \n                            \nBoard Diversity\n\nDiversity\nis among the critical factors that the Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs Committee considers when evaluating the\ncomposition\nof the Board. For a Company like Citi, which operates in more\nthan 100 countries around the globe, diversity includes race,\nethnicity, nationality, and gender as well as the diversity of\nthe communities and geographies in which Citi operates. Included\nin\nthe qualifications for Directors listed in the Company\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines is \u201cwhether the candidate has\nspecial skills, expertise and background that would complement\nthe attributes of the existing Directors, taking into\nconsideration\nthe diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\u201d\nCiti\u2019s Board is committed to building a Board that is\ncomposed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity\nrepresented by our employees, customers, and stakeholders. When\nconsidering new Director candidates, the Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to\ninclude diverse candidates in each slate. In this context, eight\nof the candidates nominated for election at Citi\u2019s 2024\nAnnual Meeting are diverse. In addition, each Director candidate\ncontributes to the Board\u2019s overall diversity by providing a\nvariety of perspectives, personal and professional experiences,\nand backgrounds, as well as other characteristics, such as\nglobal\nand international business experience. The Board believes that\nthe current nominees reflect an appropriate diversity of gender,\nage,\nrace, national origin, geographical background, and experience\nand is committed to continuing to consider diversity and assess\nits\neffectiveness in this regard in evaluating the composition of\nthe Board.\n\nDirector Education Program\n\nCiti has a robust Director Education Program\nthat begins with an orientation for newly appointed Directors,\nproviding two days of in-depth training covering all aspects of\nour\nbusiness, including, among other things, coverage of Citi\u2019s new\norganizational model, including the following five business\nlines: (1) Services, which includes both Treasury & Trade\nSolutions and Securities Services; (2) Banking, which includes\nInvestment Banking and Corporate Lending; (3) Markets; (4) U.S.\nPersonal Banking; and (5) Wealth.

Accordingly, Citi has established an\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to manage Citi\u2019s\nrisks appropriately and consistently across Citi and at an\naggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework details the\nprinciples used to support effective enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The\nERM Framework\nalso provides clarity on risk management roles and\nresponsibilities of the Citigroup Board of Directors, Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management\nTeam and employees across the lines of defense. Citi\u2019s culture\nand values drive a strong risk and control environment, and are\nat\nthe heart of the ERM Framework, underpinning the way Citi\nconducts business. The activities that Citi engages in, and the\nrisks those\nactivities generate, must be consistent with Citi\u2019s Mission and\nValue Proposition and the key principles that guide it, as well\nas Citi\u2019s risk appetite.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  Corporate Governance  31  \n                            \nThe Citi Board of Directors is responsible for\noversight of risk management and holds the Executive Management\nTeam accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and managing\nrisk within the defined risk appetite as it meets its strategic\nobjectives. The Board\u2019s Transformation Oversight Committee\noversees management\u2019s progress as it relates to the broader\ntransformation of Citi and management\u2019s remediation of\nissues identified under the Consent Order, dated October 7,\n2020, entered into by Citi with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB\nConsent\nOrder), including issues related to our risk and control\nenvironment. A similar Committee was formed by the Citibank,\nN.A. (CBNA)\nBoard to provide oversight of management\u2019s remediation of issues\nidentified under the Consent Order, dated October 7, 2020,\nentered into by CBNA with the OCC (OCC Consent Order and\ntogether with the FRB Consent Order, the Consent Orders).\n(Please see page\n32 to review additional disclosure on the Transformation\nOversight Committee.) In addition, the Board of Directors has\ndelegated\noversight of specific risks, as set forth below, to certain\nother Board committees, based on their mandates.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense model as a key component\nof its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense\nmodel brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk\nassurance under\none umbrella and provides an avenue for risk accountability of\nthe first line of defense, a construct for effective challenge\nby the second\nline of defense (Independent Risk Management and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management), and empowers independent risk\nassurance by the\nthird line of defense (Internal Audit). Citi has enterprise\nsupport functions that support safety and soundness across Citi.\nEach of the\nlines of defense and enterprise support functions, along with\nthe Board, are empowered to perform relevant risk management\nprocesses and\nresponsibilities in order to manage Citi\u2019s risks within the\ndefined risk appetite in a consistent and effective manner.\n\nFor more information about

with respect\nto the Company\u2019s approach to management of major risks,\nincluding\nmanagement\u2019s risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate.\nIndependent Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer, sets\nrisk and\ncontrol standards for the first line of defense and actively\nmanages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading and non-\ntrading),\nliquidity, strategic, operational and reputation risks across\nCiti, including risks that span categories, such as\nconcentration risk,\ncountry risk, compliance risk, and climate risk. The Board\u2019s\nrole is to oversee this effort.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee enhances the Board\u2019s\noversight of risk management. The Committee\u2019s role is one of\noversight, recognizing that management is responsible for\nexecuting\nCiti\u2019s risk management policies.\n\nTransformation Enhancements at Citi\n\nCiti is fully committed to a broad-based transformation\nof its risk management and controls. Citi believes the\nTransformation is essential, not only to address regulatory\nmatters in an effective,\ntimely, and sustainable manner, but also as a broader strategic\nimperative for the firm. Citi\u2019s priorities revolve around three\ninterconnected elements: the Transformation, strategy, and\nculture and talent. Driving toward excellence in risk and\ncontrols in the Transformation\nis mutually reinforcing with Citi\u2019s business strategy, and\nsuccess for both can only be achieved with significant shifts in\nculture\nand talent.\n\nThe Board established the Transformation Oversight\nCommittee in October 2020, to serve as the primary forum for\nBoard oversight of the Transformation. Given this overall\nresponsibility\nof the Transformation Oversight Committee and the need for\nholistic oversight, all non-management directors on the Board\nserve on the\nCommittee. The full Board focuses on non-Transformation matters\nin other forums.\n\nA series of Program Groups focus on specific requirements\nof the Consent Order. Certain members of the Transformation\nOversight Committee (Lead Directors) who have been assigned to\nthe various\nProgram Groups, work closely with the Executive Management Team\nmembers responsible for the relevant Program Groups to provide\noversight\nand challenge to the Program Groups as they prepare for meetings\nwith the entire Transformation Oversight Committee, in much the\nsame\nway as Board Committee Chairs interact with individual senior\nmanagement team members in preparation for committee meetings.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Technology Oversight\n\nThe Board directly or through one or more Committees\nprovides oversight of Management\u2019s efforts to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board is\nbriefed in\nfull at least annually, and one or more Committees receive\nregular reports on cybersecurity and engage in discussions\nthroughout the year\nwith Management and subject-matter experts on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s overall cybersecurity program, cybersecurity risks,\nCiti\u2019s\nstrategies for addressing these risks, and Citi\u2019s implementation\nthereof. The Board participates in periodic cybersecurity\ntabletop\nexercises. Additionally, Board and/or Committee members receive\nreporting on significant cyber events including response\nefforts, legal\nobligations, and outreach and notification to regulators and/or\ncustomers when needed, as well as provide guidance to management\nas appropriate.\nThe Risk Management Committee has approved a standalone\nCybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against which Citi\u2019s\nperformance is\nmeasured quarterly.\n\nThe Technology Committee also oversees technology\nmatters as discussed on page 37 of this proxy statement. The\nCommittee also has primary oversight for emerging technologies\nsuch\nas Generative Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,\nincluding the risks or benefits related to emerging\ntechnologies.\nMembers of the Technology Committee bring meaningful insight and\nexpertise into how artificial intelligence technologies\nintersect\nwith the financial services industry, further strengthening the\nBoard\u2019s oversight of this important area.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Environmental and Social Matters\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors has ultimate oversight\nof Citi\u2019s work to identify, assess and integrate environmental\nand social-related risks and opportunities throughout Citi. In\naddition to\noversight by the full Board, the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee of the Board oversees Citi\u2019s ESG\nactivity, including reviewing our policies and programs for\nsustainability, climate change, human rights and diversity,\nequity and inclusion. The Risk Management\nCommittee of the Board reviews key risk policies, including\nthose related to environmental, social and climate risk. The\nAudit Committee\nhas oversight over the controls and procedures related to Citi\u2019s\ngroup level ESG and climate-related reporting, including both\nvoluntary\ndisclosures and regulatory filings.

The\nBoard\nalso received reports from the Head of Community Investing and\nDevelopment on Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s social impact\nactivities\nand performance, including Action for Racial Equity and the\ninvestments of the Citi Impact Fund. In addition, the Board\nreceived\nreports on Citi\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from\nthe Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and\nGlobal\nHead of Talent.

For\nthis purpose, an executive officer means any person designated\nby Citi as\nan \u201cofficer\u201d under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies to all\nCiti employees, executive officers and Directors, states that\nwhen considering personal investments in Citi securities, an\nindividual\nmust avoid any personal trade or investment in a security,\nderivative, futures contract, commodity, or other financial\ninstrument if the\ntrade or investment might affect or appear to affect the\nindividual\u2019s ability to make unbiased business decisions for\nCiti.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Personal Trading and Investment\nPolicy (the PTIP) prohibits the hedging in any manner (other\nthan currency hedges) by Covered Persons (including directors\nand executive\nofficers) of unvested restricted stock or deferred stock awarded\nas compensation under Citi\u2019s Capital Accumulation Program. The\nPTIP also prohibits engaging in speculative transactions in Citi\nsecurities, including sales of naked calls and speculative\noption strategies,\nas well as any other transaction that would benefit from a\ndecline in the value of a Citi security.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                            \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  41  \n                            \nThe PTIP generally allows Covered Persons (excluding\ndirectors and executive officers) to hedge vested long positions\nof then deliverable Citi securities. Covered Persons under the\nPTIP include\n(but are not limited to) individuals who 1) may have access to\nmaterial non-public information regarding Citi, 2) are employed\nby Citi\u2019s\nInstitutional Clients Group, 3) are FINRA-registered employees\nor associates of any of Citi\u2019s U.S. broker-dealer entities, or\n4)\nwork in a securities or advisory business in Wealth, as well as\ncertain individuals who are related to Covered\nPersons. Because directors and executive officers who are\nCovered Persons under the PTIP are also subject to the hedging\npolicy applicable\nto directors and executive officers pursuant to the Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, a proposed transaction by a director or\nexecutive\nofficer may be prohibited by application of one policy even if\nthe transaction would be permissible under the other policy.\n\nFinally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K.\nand European regulatory requirements. These policies provide\nthat all employees in the applicable countries who receive a\nportion of their\nremuneration in stock or any other deferral mechanism designated\nby Citi must not take out insurance contracts or engage in\npersonal hedging\nstrategies, or remuneration or liability-related contracts of\ninsurance, that undermine, or may undermine, any risk alignment\neffects\nof their remuneration arrangements.\n\nReputation Risk Committee\n\nThe Reputation Risk Committee, a management\nlevel committee, governs the process by which material\nreputation risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled\nand\nreported, and oversees that appropriate actions are taken in\nline with the firmwide strategic objectives, risk appetite\nthresholds,\nand regulatory expectations, while promoting a culture of risk\nawareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior\nacross\nthe company, consistent with Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition. Business Reputation Risk Forums may escalate\nreputation\nrisks for due consideration by the Group Reputation Risk\nCommittee at the corporate level.

The Board and executive officers\nare subject\nto a stock ownership commitment, which requires these\nindividuals to maintain a minimum ownership level of Citigroup\nstock. Executive\nofficers are required to retain at least 75% of the equity\nawarded to them as incentive compensation (net of amounts\nrequired to pay\ntaxes and option exercise prices) as long as they are executive\nofficers. In addition, a stock holding period applies after the\nexecutive\nofficer leaves Citi or is no longer an executive officer. He or\nshe must retain, for one year after ending executive officer\nstatus,\n50% of the shares previously subject to the stock ownership\ncommitment. Directors are similarly required to retain at least\n75% of the\nnet equity awarded to them, further aligning their interests\nwith stockholders. The Board may revise the terms of the stock\nownership\ncommitment from time to time to reflect legal and business\ndevelopments warranting a change. In addition, Directors and\nexecutive officers\nmay not enter into hedging transactions in respect of Citi\u2019s\ncommon stock or other securities issued by Citi, including\nsecurities\ngranted by the Company to the Director or executive officer as\npart of his or her compensation and securities purchased or\nacquired by\nthe Director or executive officer in a non-compensatory\ntransaction.

Directors are not eligible\nto stand for re-election after reaching the age of 72. If\nelected, each nominee will hold office until the 2024 Annual\nMeeting or until his or her successor is qualified and elected.\n\nDirector Criteria and Nomination Process\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nconsiders all qualified candidates identified by members of the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, by other\nmembers of the Board, by senior management, and by security\nholders. During 2023, the Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to\nassist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees.\nStockholders who would like to propose a Director candidate for\nconsideration by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee may do so by submitting the candidate\u2019s name, r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\nand biographical information to the attention of the Corporate\nSecretary, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY\n10013. All proposals for nominations received by the Corporate\nSecretary will be presented to the Committee for its\nconsideration.\n\nIn considering the composition of the Board of Directors, the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee inventories\nthe categories of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business\nmix, and geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates\nwith the skills and experience necessary to enable the Board of\nDirectors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also takes\nDirector tenure into consideration when making Director\nnomination decisions and believes that it is desirable to\nmaintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced Directors and\nnewer Directors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board also\nbelieve that longer-tenured, experienced Directors are a\nsignificant strength of the Board, given the large size of our\nCompany, the breadth of our product offerings, and the\ninternational scope of our organization. When nominating new\ndirector candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include\ndiverse candidates in each slate. The Board\u2019s composition, and\nthe individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are\nthe result of careful consideration by the Committee of the\ncorrespondence between the risk inventory and skills and\nexperience of the Board members and candidates. In addition to\nthe ability to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular\nrisk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee\u2019s\nbiography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a\nvariety of factors, including the following criteria, which have\nbeen developed by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee and approved by the Board:\n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that          \n  \u25cf  indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical    \n     standards;                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has had business, governmental,      \n     non-profit or professional experience at the chair, chief  \n     executive officer, chief                                   \n     operating officer, or equivalent policy-making and         \n     operational level of a large organization with             \n     significant international activities                       \n  \u25cf  across many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that      \n     indicates that the candidate will be able to make a        \n     meaningful and immediate contribution                      \n     to the Board\u2019s discussion of and decision-making on the    \n     array of complex issues facing a large financial services  \n     business that                                              \n     operates on a global scale;                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and a  \n     diverse background that would complement the attributes    \n  \u25cf  of the existing Directors,                                 \n     taking into consideration the diverse communities and      \n     geographies in which the Company operates;                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has the financial expertise          \n  \u25cf  required to provide effective oversight of a diversified   \n     financial services business                                \n     that operates on a global scale;                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has achieved prominence in his or    \n     her business, governmental, or professional activities     \n  \u25cf  and has built a reputation                                 \n     that demonstrates the ability to make the kind of          \n     important and sensitive judgments that the Board is        \n     called upon to make;                                       \n                                                                \nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                         \n  Proposal 1: Election of Directors  47  \n                                         \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate will effectively, consistently, and  \n     appropriately take into account and balance the            \n     legitimate interests and concerns                          \n  \u25cf  of all of the Company\u2019s stockholders and other             \n     stakeholders in reaching decisions, rather than advancing  \n     the interests of a particular                              \n     constituency;                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate possesses a willingness to           \n  \u25cf  challenge management while working constructively as part  \n     of a team in an environment                                \n     of collegiality and trust; and                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient    \n  \u25cf  time and energy to the performance of his or her duties    \n     as a Director.                                             \n                                                                \nApplication of these factors involves the exercise of judgment\nby the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and\nthe Board.

For the 2024 Annual\nMeeting, Citi did not receive notice from any stockholders\nregarding a nomination to the Board of Directors.\n\nDirector Qualifications\n\nThe nominees for the Board of Directors each have the\nqualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi\u2019s\nstrategy and to oversee management\u2019s execution of that strategic\nvision. Citi\u2019s Board of Directors consists of individuals with\nthe skills, experience, and diverse backgrounds necessary to\noversee Citi\u2019s efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller,\nsafer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk\nand operating within a complex financial and regulatory\nenvironment.\n\nThe nominees listed below are leaders in business, the financial\ncommunity, and academia because of their intellectual acumen and\nanalytical skills, strategic vision, ability to lead and inspire\nothers to work with them, and records of outstanding\naccomplishments over a period of decades.

As such, they have\na deep understanding of, and extensive experience in, many of\nthe areas that are outlined below as being of critical\nimportance to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success. For the\npurposes of its analysis, the Board has determined that nominees\nwho have served as a chief executive officer or a chair of a\nmajor corporation or large, complex institution have extensive\nexperience with strategic planning, financial statement\npreparation, compensation determinations, regulatory compliance\n(if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate\ngovernance, public affairs, and legal matters.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                \n  48  Proposal                  \n      1: Election of Directors  \n                                \nIn evaluating the composition of the Board, the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee seeks to find and retain\nindividuals who, in addition to having the qualifications set\nforth in Citi\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, have the\nskills, experience and abilities necessary to meet Citi\u2019s unique\nneeds as a highly regulated financial services company with\noperations within the United States and more than 100 countries\naround the globe. The Committee has determined it is critically\nimportant to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success that its Board\nhas, in addition to the qualities described above, expertise and\nexperience in the following areas:\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Compensation, Performance Management and Culture       \n  Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of  \n  the CEO and approving                                         \n  the compensation of other executive officers of the Company   \n  and the Executive Management Team. In order to properly       \n  carry out its                                                 \n  responsibilities with respect to compensation, Citi\u2019s Board   \n  must include members who have experience evaluating the       \n  structure of compensation for senior executives. They must    \n  understand the various forms of compensation that can be      \n  utilized, the                                                 \n  purpose of each type and how various elements of              \n  compensation can be used to motivate and reward executives    \n  and drive performance,                                        \n  while not encouraging imprudent risk-taking or simply having  \n  short-term goals.                                             \n  Citi                                                          \n  aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and  \n  ethical conduct: doing what we say, reporting results with    \n  accuracy                                                      \n  and transparency, and maintaining compliance with the laws,   \n  rules, and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s businesses.  \n  The Board                                                     \n  is responsible for shaping corporate governance policies and  \n  practices, including adopting the corporate governance        \n  guidelines                                                    \n  applicable to the Company and monitoring the Company\u2019s        \n  compliance with governance policies and the guidelines.

Citi has been         \n  engaged in sustainability                                     \n  for over 20 years and views the environment, sustainability   \n  and transparency as important aspects of stockholder and      \n  broader stakeholder                                           \n  value. Citi communicates its sustainability and               \n  environmental efforts to stockholders, clients and other      \n  stakeholders,                                                 \n  including its achievements in the areas of environmental      \n  sustainability, climate change, net zero, community           \n  investment                                                    \n  and development, and human rights. Environmental and social   \n  issues have the potential to impede corporate plans and       \n  long-term performance,                                        \n  which is why it is necessary to have a                        \n  sustainability-competent Board. Citi\u2019s Board must include     \n  members with experience in the                                \n  areas of climate change and finance, community development,   \n  corporate social responsibility and other issues to help      \n  Citi navigate                                                 \n  these complex and quickly evolving issues and to assist       \n  management in evaluating Citi\u2019s policies and\u00a0programs.        \n  Citi\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are         \n  designed to ensure that Citi\u2019s financial reporting and its    \n  financial statements                                          \n  are prepared in accordance with generally accepted            \n  accounting principles.

Having Directors with         \n  experience interacting                                        \n  with regulators or operating businesses subject to extensive  \n  regulation is important to furthering Citi\u2019s continued        \n  compliance with                                               \n  its many regulatory requirements and fostering productive     \n  relationships with its regulators. Given the critical         \n  importance of ethics,                                         \n  conduct and culture, Citi\u2019s Board must include members with   \n  experience overseeing ethics and compliance and building an   \n  effective,                                                    \n  values-based ethics and compliance program.

                                                    \nThe key objectives of our Director Compensation Program are to  \nattract qualified talent, provide pay that is commensurate with \nthe substantial time commitment associated with service, and    \nfoster commonality of interest between Board members and our    \nstockholders.                                                   \n

\nrecommendations to the Board based on periodic benchmarking     \nassessments and advice received from FW Cook, its independent   \nadvisor. In making recommendations to the Board, the Committee  \nconsiders the competitive positioning of the aggregate and      \nindividual components of compensation, as well as the mix of pay\nand structure versus both direct competitors and other          \ncomparable organizations. The Committee also considers the      \nunique skill set required to serve on our Board and the intense \ntime commitment associated with preparation for and attendance  \nat meetings of the Board and its committees as well as external \ncommitments, such as engagement with our stockholders and       \nregulators. Since our initial public offering in 1986, Citi has \npaid outside Directors all or a portion of their compensation in\ncommon stock to ensure that the Directors have an ownership     \ninterest in common with other stockholders.                     \n                                                                \n  Annual                                                        \n  Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award                        \n  Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of     \n  $75,000 and a deferred stock award valued at $150,000. The    \n  deferred stock award                                          \n  is generally granted in early January. In the event a         \n  Director retires or resigns from the Board in the year for    \n  which an award is granted                                     \n  before attaining age 72, a pro rata portion of the award is   \n  forfeited, based on the number of full or partial calendar    \n  quarters served.                                              \n  The deferred stock award generally becomes distributable on   \n  the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and           \n  Directors may elect to                                        \n  defer receipt of the award beyond that date.                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Fees                                                          \n  for Service on Citi\u2019s Board Committees, Citibank\u2019s Board,     \n  and other Board Service                                       \n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Citi Director who serves as Chair of the Audit          \n  Committee, Compensation, Performance Management and Culture   \n  Committee, Risk Management                                    \n  Committee, Technology Committee, or certain ad hoc            \n  committees is entitled to an annual $50,000 Committee Chair   \n  Fee per committee.

KPMG LLP,\nCitigroup\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\n(independent auditors) is responsible for the integrated audit\nof\nthe consolidated financial statements and internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The Committee\u2019s responsibility is to\nmonitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The members\nof the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice\nof\naccounting or auditing and are not professionals in these\nfields. The Committee relies, without independent verification,\non the\ninformation provided to it and on the representations made by\nmanagement regarding the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, that the financial statements have been\nprepared with integrity and objectivity and that such financial\nstatements have been prepared in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe\nCommittee also relies on the opinions of the independent\nauditors of the consolidated financial statements and the\neffectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s meetings facilitate communication among\nthe members of the Committee, management, the internal auditors,\nand Citigroup\u2019s independent auditors. The Committee separately\nmet with each of the internal and independent auditors with and\nwithout management, to discuss the results of their examinations\nand their\nobservations and recommendations regarding Citigroup\u2019s internal\ncontrols. The Committee discussed with the independent auditors\nthe matters required to be discussed by the applicable\nrequirements of the PCAOB.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements of Citigroup as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 with management, the internal auditors, and\nCitigroup\u2019s\nindependent auditors.\n\nThe Committee has received the written disclosures required\nby PCAOB Rule 3526, \u201cCommunication with Audit Committees\nConcerning Independence.\u201d The Committee discussed with the\nindependent\nauditors any relationships that may have an impact on their\nobjectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the\nauditors\u2019\nindependence.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed and\napproved the amount of fees paid to the independent auditors for\naudit, audit-related and tax compliance, and other services. The\nCommittee concluded that the provision of services by the\nindependent auditors did not impair their independence.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned review and discussions, and\nsubject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities\ndescribed above and in the Committee charter, the Committee\nrecommended to\nthe Board that Citigroup\u2019s audited consolidated financial\nstatements be included in Citigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC.\n\nThe Audit Committee:\n\nJames S.

The Audit Committee has concluded that the fees earned\nby\nKPMG were consistent with the maintenance of the external\nauditors\u2019 independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.\n\nThe Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided\nand fees earned by Citi\u2019s independent registered public\naccounting firm. The Audit Committee annually considers the\nprovision of\naudit services and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined\naudit fees, audit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with\nspecific\ndollar-value limits for each category of service. The Audit\nCommittee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific\nengagements that\nare not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal control and\ncertain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed pre-approved\nfee amounts.\nOn an interim basis, any proposed engagement that does not fit\nwithin the definition of a pre-approved service may be presented\nto the\nChair of the Audit Committee for approval and to the full Audit\nCommittee at its next regular meeting.\n\nThe Accounting Firm Engagement Procedure is the primary basis\nupon which management ensures the independence of its\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Administration of\nthe Procedure is\ncentralized in, and monitored by, Citi senior corporate\nfinancial management, which reports the engagements earned by\nKPMG throughout\nthe year to the Audit Committee. The Procedure also includes\nlimitations on the hiring of KPMG partners and other\nprofessionals to ensure\nthat Citi satisfies applicable auditor independence rules.\n\nKPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting\nfirm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. As in prior years,\nCiti and its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in\nconnection\nwith the Audit Committee\u2019s consideration of whether to recommend\nthat stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as Citi\u2019s\nindependent auditor for the following year. In that review, the\nAudit Committee considers both the continued independence of\nKPMG and\nwhether retaining KPMG is in the best interests of Citi and its\nstockholders. Citi\u2019s management prepares an annual assessment of\nKPMG for the Audit Committee that includes (i) the results of a\nmanagement survey of KPMG\u2019s overall performance; (ii) review of\nexternal data on audit quality and performance, including recent\nPCAOB reports on KPMG and its peer firms; (iii) an analysis of\nKPMG\u2019s\nknown legal risks and significant proceedings that may impair\nKPMG\u2019s ability to perform Citi\u2019s annual audit; and (iv) KPMG\u2019s\nfees and services provided to Citi both on an absolute basis,\nnoting, of course, that KPMG does not provide any non-audit\nservices, other\nthan those described in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and\ncompared to services provided by other auditing firms to peer\ninstitutions.\nIn addition, KPMG reviews with the Audit Committee its analysis\nof its independence in accordance with the Accounting Firm\nEngagement\nProcedure and PCAOB Rule 3526. In performing its analysis, the\nAudit Committee considered the length of time KPMG has been\nCiti\u2019s\nindependent auditor, the breadth and complexity of Citi\u2019s\nbusiness and its global footprint and the resulting demands\nplaced on\nits auditing firm in terms of expertise in Citi\u2019s businesses,\nthe quantity and quality of staff, and global reach. The Audit\nCommittee\nrecognized the ability of KPMG to provide both the necessary\nexpertise to audit Citi\u2019s business and the matching global\nfootprint\nto audit Citi worldwide and other factors, including the\npolicies that KPMG follows with respect to rotation of the key\naudit personnel,\nso that there is a new partner-in-charge at least every five\nyears. Citi\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the process for, and\nultimately\napproves, the selection of the independent auditor\u2019s lead\nengagement partner at the five-year mandatory rotation period.\nAt the\nAudit Committee\u2019s instruction, KPMG selects candidates to be\nconsidered for the lead engagement partner role, who are then\ninterviewed\nby members of Citi\u2019s senior management. After considering the\ncandidates recommended by KPMG, senior management makes a\nrecommendation\nto the Audit Committee regarding the new lead engagement\npartner. After discussing the qualifications of the proposed\nlead engagement\npartner with the current lead engagement partner and senior\nleadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit Committee,\nindividually and/or as a group, interview the leading candidate.\nThe Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes as\nan Audit Committee on\nthe selection.

We launched\nour Transformation\ninitiative in 2020 to make real and sustainable changes to\nstrengthen our risk and control environment and modernize our\noperating model.\n\nWhile every member of our leadership team is involved in\nthe Transformation and plays a key, hands-on role in its\nimplementation, Ms. Fraser has taken a leading role in managing\nthe effort. She\nhas assembled an extraordinary team of top talent, consisting of\nlong-tenured colleagues and new hires as appropriate, from\nacross multiple\ndisciplines and areas of expertise and experience, with\nrepresentatives from the businesses and global functions, to\nlead seven different\nTransformation programs, including one added in 2023. Ms. Fraser\nis putting our best talent into this effort and has a detailed,\nintegrated approach\nto address the needs of our clients, investors and regulators.\n\nMs. Fraser has built an\norganization and infrastructure to manage, guide and support our\nTransformation. The organizational structure spans all Citi\nbusinesses and functions to ensure consistency. Initially, the\nstructure provided the tools to achieve that objective through\nour\nChief Administrative Officer (CAO) as well as various global\nforums and committees. Following our CAO\u2019s retirement in 2023,\nMs. Fraser appointed our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), who\nreports to Ms. Fraser and is responsible for running Citi\u2019s\nTransformation program, as well as leading our work to improve\noperating efficiency and returns and leading our enterprise-wide\neffort to strengthen the firm\u2019s risk and controls and data, and\nmodernize infrastructure while simplifying the firm.\n                          \n  2022 STRATEGIC REFRESH  \n                          \nOne of our major goals for 2022 and 2023 was to put in place a\nstrategic plan designed to create long-term value for our\nstockholders\nand to get that plan swiftly off the ground. We have made\nsignificant progress toward that end.\n\nOf the 14 consumer divestitures we announced, we have completed\nsales of nine of our consumer franchises, including Australia,\nBahrain,\nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand\nand Vietnam, with four of those sales completed in 2023. In May\n2023, we\nannounced plans to pursue an IPO of our consumer, small business\nand middle-market operations in Mexico, and have since made\nsignificant\nprogress on the separation of the IPO business from the\ninstitutional business which is expected in the second half of\n2024. We continued\nto progress with the wind down of our consumer operations in\nKorea and China, and consumer, local commercial and\ninstitutional businesses\nin Russia \u2013 including through portfolio sales \u2013 and restarted\nthe sales process of our consumer business in Poland.\n\nWe also made meaningful progress on our culture refresh\nbeginning with the launch of Citi\u2019s New Way in 2022. This is a\nthree-year\nresearch-based program that will integrate small but meaningful\nbehavioral habits to drive execution excellence within the firm.\nAdditional\ninformation concerning our cultural transformation is on page\n82.\n                                      \n  2023 ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLIFICATION  \n                                      \nIn September 2023, Ms. Fraser announced significant changes to\nCiti\u2019s organizational model to align our structure\nwith our strategy, which is centered around five core,\ninterconnected businesses. This critical work will simplify\nCiti,\nadvance our Transformation and ensure that our clients are at\nthe center of all we do.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  74  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \nThis new organizational model is\npart of the work under way at Citi to execute the vision and\nstrategy we presented at our 2022 Investor Day and to deliver on\nour\nmedium-term targets. Our vision is to be the preeminent banking\npartner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global\nleader in\nwealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the leaders of Citi\u2019s five\ninterconnected businesses now report directly to Ms. Fraser\ngiving them greater accountability for delivering results.\nDelivery of Citi\u2019s global network will be enhanced through\na streamlined geographic and business management structure and a\ncentralized Client organization will help\nstrengthen how we deliver for clients across the firm.\n\nThe new, flatter operating model eliminates management layers\nand regional management structures. This will\nmake Citi a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve\nour clients and unlock value for our stockholders.\n\nAt the same time, eliminating activities that detract from our\ncompetitiveness or add unnecessary complexity will\nmake us more agile in assessing risk and driving increased\naccountability across the firm.\n\nA lighter management structure for our international franchises\nwill create a stronger, more consistent enterprise-wide\napproach to how we deliver for our core client base of\nmultinational institutions.\n\nThrough our new, centralized Client organization we can take a\ncomprehensive view of our relationships, client strategy and\nclient coverage model across our businesses. This will ensure we\ncontinue to break down silos and focus on firm-wide performance\nand outcomes.

In assessing the\nimpact of\nour financial performance in the fourth quarter on Ms. Fraser\u2019s\npay outcome, the Compensation Committee considered that the\nfourth\nquarter financial performance was largely driven by\ncircumstances outside of her control, namely expenses associated\nwith the FDIC special\nassessment, a reserve build associated with transfer risk in\nRussia and Argentina, the pre-tax revenue impact from the\ndevaluation of\nthe Argentine peso and a restructuring charge related to actions\ntaken as part of Citi\u2019s organizational simplification.\n\nIn order to align Ms.\nFraser\u2019s compensation with stockholder interests, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the components of her\n2023\nincentive compensation would, as in 2022, continue to be\nweighted toward stock-based compensation. Ms. Fraser\u2019s\ncompensation\nis aligned with stockholder interests through various features\nof our compensation program that tie the amount of compensation\nto\nour stock price and financial metrics. The disclosure on page\n111 concerning pay versus performance, as required by SEC\ndisclosure\nrules, provides additional information concerning that\nalignment. The stockholder alignment of our compensation program\nis\nillustrated by the fact, as described on page 111, that while\nMs. Fraser\u2019s total compensation as reflected in the Summary\nCompensation Table on page 104 was approximately $26 million in\n2023, the amount actually paid to Ms. Fraser, determined\npursuant to\nthe SEC\u2019s pay versus performance disclosure rules, was\napproximately $20.7 million.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  76  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \n                                \n  TRANSFORMATION BONUS PROGRAM  \n                                \nTo incentivize effective execution in connection with the\nConsent Order programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s risk and\ncontrol environment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation\nCommittee\napproved the Transformation Bonus Program. A description of the\nTransformation Bonus Program was included in our 2022 Proxy\nStatement.\nAdditional information related to the Transformation Bonus\nProgram can be found in the supplemental solicitation materials\nCiti filed\nwith the SEC in 2022, which can be accessed at\nwww.citigroup.com. Ms. Fraser is not eligible to participate in\nthe Transformation Bonus\nProgram. All other members of our EMT at the time the\nTransformation Bonus Program was adopted, as well as\napproximately 250 other employees who were deemed\nto be critical to execution in connection with the Consent Order\nprograms, were eligible to participate in the Transformation\nBonus Program.\n\nEvery member of our leadership team is involved in the\nTransformation\nand plays a key, hands-on role in its implementation. We have\nassembled an extraordinary team of top talent, consisting of\nlong-tenured\ncolleagues and new hires as appropriate, from across multiple\nbackgrounds and perspectives, and areas of expertise and\nexperience, with representatives\nfrom the businesses and global functions, to lead seven\ndifferent Transformation programs, including one added in 2023.\nWe are putting our best talent into this effort and have a\ndetailed, integrated approach to address\nthe needs of our clients, investors and regulators.\n\nFollowing the completion of the\nfirst performance measurement period under the Transformation\nBonus Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the\nPerformance Achievement Percentage for the period ending on\nDecember 31, 2022 would be 94%. Following completion of the\nsecond measurement period, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the Performance\nAchievement Percentage for the period ending on December 31,\n2023 would be 80%. Citi provides both\nregulators on an ongoing basis information regarding its plans\nand progress and continues to work constructively with both\nregulators to reflect their feedback on remediation efforts.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the Transformation\nBonus Program were not changed for 2023. In approving the\nTransformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee did not\nintend\nthat it would be a replacement, substitution or make-up for any\nother compensation amount, nor does the Compensation Committee\nexpect to make other special awards related to the\nTransformation in the future. For further information concerning\nthe\nTransformation Bonus Program see pages 82 and 94 to 95.\n                        \n  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  \n                        \nSince 2013, Citi has delivered a portion of incentive\ncompensation for our EMT in the form of PSUs. For 2023,\nwe expanded the use of PSUs in our compensation program by\nextending the use of PSUs to EMT members resident in the UK. In\naddition, our\nEMT was enlarged from 16 to 19 executives.\n\nAs described more fully on page\n93 below, the Compensation Committee determined that 100% of the\ntarget number of shares subject to PSUs granted as part of our\n2020\nincentive compensation awards were earned for the three-year\nperformance period from 2021 through 2023.

We launched our Transformation initiative\nin 2020 to make real and sustainable changes to strengthen our\nrisk and\ncontrol environment and modernize and simplify our firm to make\nCiti a better bank for our clients and a more productive place\nfor our\ncolleagues to work.\n\nOur Transformation Steering Committee, chaired by our CEO,\nsets the overall direction for our Transformation efforts, with\noversight from our Board of Directors. In 2023, we placed\nleaders with\ndemonstrated success in leading transformative change in key\nroles to steer our Transformation. For example, we appointed a\nnew Chief\nOperating Officer to advance progress across the firm and engage\nCiti colleagues in the important role they have in driving our\nTransformation\nand strengthening our culture.\n\nIn 2023, we progressed our Transformation efforts into full\nimplementation mode. We continue to simplify and modernize the\nfirm to better manage risk in many ways, including by\nconsolidating technology\nplatforms, automating processes and reducing manual touch\npoints, enhancing data quality and governance, and implementing\na new model\nfor managing wholesale credit risk.\n\nOur organizational simplification efforts, discussed below,\nwill advance the execution of Citi\u2019s Transformation, the firm\u2019s\ntop priority. While implementing our simplification strategy,\nCiti remains focused on transforming our risk management,\ncontrols and infrastructure so that we can operate at scale\nand with speed to deliver client excellence.\n\nLeadership Pillar\n\nThe primary Leadership highlights for Citi in 2023 arose\nfrom the need to continue to execute on our strategic refresh.\n                                     \n  OUR ORGANIZATIONAL SIMPLIFICATION  \n                                     \nIn September 2023, Citi announced significant changes to\nsimplify our organizational model so that it is aligned with our\nstrategy, advances\nour Transformation and ensures that our clients are at the\ncenter of all we do.\n\nThis new organizational model is\npart of the work under way at Citi to execute the plan we\npresented at our 2022 Investor Day and deliver on our medium-\nterm\ntargets.\n\nAt Investor Day, we set a clear, compelling vision for the firm\nto be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with\ncross-border\nneeds, a global leader in wealth management and a valued\npersonal bank in our home market.\n\nWe have been\nexecuting a strategy to bring this vision to life through our\nfive interconnected businesses:\n                                                     \n  \u25cf  Services \u2013 includes Treasury & Trade Solutions  \n     and Securities Services                         \n                                                     \n              \n  \u25cf  Markets  \n              \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  Banking \u2013 includes Investment Banking and Corporate        \n     Lending                                                    \n                                                                \n                            \n  \u25cf  U.S. Personal Banking  \n                            \n             \n  \u25cf  Wealth  \n             \nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023  81  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \nThe interconnectivity of these businesses will benefit our\nclients and support our strategic shift to a more balanced\nbusiness mix that\ndelivers higher returns, fees, and growth over time. This\nincreased focus on business services and the connectivity we now\nhave across\nour businesses that operate under a set of common standards,\nplatforms, controls and processes for similar activities will\nalso lead to\na reduction in risk over time.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the leaders of Citi\u2019s\nfive interconnected businesses now report directly to the CEO,\ndelivery of Citi\u2019s global network will be enhanced through a\nstreamlined\ngeographic structure and a new, centralized Client organization\nwill help strengthen how we deliver for clients.\nThe new flatter operating model                                 \nelevated the leaders of Citi\u2019s five businesses and eliminated   \nthe Institutional Clients Group and Personal Banking and Wealth \nManagement layers as well as the regional structures consisting \nof Citi Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin     \nAmerica.                                                        \nThis will speed up decision-making and drive increased          \naccountability.                                                 \n                                                                \nWe are eliminating activities that detract from our             \ncompetitiveness                                                 \nor add unnecessary complexity.

Citi\u2019s New Way is a three-year,\nresearch-based\nprogram that gradually introduces a series of small, simple\ndaily habits to drive critical cultural improvements across the\norganization. The goal of this effort is to embed the behaviors\nthat Citi needs most to drive a culture of excellence and\naccountability at the bank and alignment with our Leadership\nPrinciples. Our cultural transformation is taken into account in\nthe\nperformance assessment under our Transformation Bonus Program.\nAdditional information about our Transformation Bonus Program is\non\npages 76 and 94 to 95.\n\nAt the start of the program, specific habits were rolled\nout to help drive greater clarity around ownership of projects,\ndecisions and meeting discussions. These habits were introduced\nvia 45-minute\nworkshops, open to all Citi colleagues, which explained how\nthese habits can improve day-to-day collaboration. Results from\nthis initial\nrollout show that 60% of Citi colleagues use these ownership\nhabits at least once a week.\n\nIn 2023, the program\u2019s focus turned to \u2018productive\ndebate,\u2019 designed to enable more timely, effective decision-\nmaking. Attendance at these workshops in 2023 was 13% higher\nthan in\n2022, and over 75% of participants indicated the habits they\nlearned resulted in more informed decision-making and increased\nemployee\nwillingness to raise risks and concerns during discussions. In\naddition to these internal results, the program received several\nprestigious\naccolades from the Association of Business Psychology for\noperational excellence and innovation in 2023.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023  83  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \n2023 NEO Performance\nThe foregoing                                                   \nsections of our Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth  \nthe 2023 annual compensation of our NEOs and                    \nsummarize our firmwide performance highlights in the four       \nperformance pillars of our compensation accountability rationale\ntool                                                            \n(CART)\u0097Financial, Risk and Control, Client and Franchise, and    \nLeadership\u0097during 2023.                                          \n                                                                \nThe following provides further detail concerning the decisions  \nmade by the Compensation Committee in respect of 2023           \ncompensation for                                                \nour NEOs individually, other than Mr. Sieg.

in 2024 in respect of performance during 2023. The\nperformance metrics approved from the 2023 PSUs are Return on\nTangible Common Equity (RoTCE) and Tangible Book Value Per Share\n(TBVPS),\nand cover the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026.\nThe RoTCE metric has been adjusted to maintain a relative\ncomparison to\npeers in order to protect against unusual macroeconomic\nenvironment events, but within a narrower range than in 2022 and\nto align more\nclosely to target payout based on our three-year plan, and to\nuse a weighted average RoTCE across the three-year performance\nperiod. The\nTBVPS grid has been increased to align with our three-year plan.\n                                                                \n                                         PERFORMA\u2026

For additional information about the Consent\nOrders, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2013Compliance Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23,\n2024, and Citi\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC\non\nOctober 7, 2020.\n\nColleagues at all levels are expected to play an active\nrole in achieving these standards, and senior leaders are\naccountable for driving progress. To incentivize effective\nexecution in connection\nwith the Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s\nrisk and control environment and culture, in August 2021 the\nCompensation\nCommittee approved the Transformation Bonus Program. A\ndescription of the Transformation Bonus Program was included in\nour 2022 Proxy\nStatement. Additional information related to the Transformation\nBonus Program can be found in the supplemental solicitation\nmaterials\nfiled by us in 2022 with the SEC, which can be accessed on our\npublic website.\n\nMs. Fraser is not eligible to participate in the Transformation\nBonus Program. All other members of our EMT at the time the\nProgram was adopted, as well as approximately 250 other\nemployees who are\ndeemed to be critical to execution in connection with the\nConsent Order programs, are eligible to participate in the\nTransformation Bonus\nProgram.\n\nPerformance under our\nTransformation Bonus Program is based on the collective\nachievement of metrics in various categories, rather than on\nindividual\nperformance, in order to foster a unified, collective focus on\nachieving key Transformation goals and ensure consistent\nleadership\nthroughout the multi-year effort. Central to the design of the\nTransformation Bonus Program was the recognition that our\nability to\nachieve the objectives of our Transformation requires collective\neffort over a multi-year period. Accordingly, participants in\nthe\nTransformation Bonus Program are collectively evaluated against\noutcomes in order to foster a culture of shared accountability.\n\nPerformance is measured, and the\nbonus, if any, payable pursuant to the Transformation Bonus\nProgram is paid in three tranches, each representing a separate\nperformance period. Specific goals and related metrics are\nestablished for each of the three tranches. The maximum portion\nof the\nbonus payable for each tranche is: 25% for the first tranche,\n25% for the second tranche and 50% for the third tranche.\n\nShortly before each designated\npayment date, an assessment is made by the Compensation\nCommittee to determine what portion \u2013 if any \u2013 of the relevant\ntranche is collectively earned based on performance relative to\nspecific preset targets for the applicable performance period.\nThe\nportion to be paid out for each tranche will be applied to all\nparticipants in the Transformation Bonus Program on a consistent\nbasis. For example, while a maximum of 25% of the award can be\nearned for the first tranche, if the Compensation Committee\ndetermines, based on the relevant criteria, that collective\nperformance merits only a 15% payout, then each participant will\nonly be paid 15% for that tranche (assuming they satisfy all\nother conditions for entitlement to be paid).\n\nThe first and second tranches are only impacted by\nperformance relative to preset targets. Each constitutes a\nmaximum of 25% of the award. The third tranche, which\nconstitutes a\nmaximum of 50% of the award, is affected by both performance\nrelative to preset targets and stock performance. For this third\ntranche,\nonce performance is accounted for and the base payout is\ndetermined to be either the maximum 50% or some lower percentage\nas described\nabove, the payout is further adjusted based on stock\nperformance. That is, the payout amount is further adjusted\ndownward or upward as\nif that payout had been invested in Citi common stock, from the\ndate of grant of each award through the payment date for the\nthird tranche,\ntaking into account stock price changes and the sum of dividends\npaid (without interest or assumed reinvestment), consistent with\nour\ncustomary approach for equity-based compensation. The starting\nvalue for this calculation is $70.37, the average closing price\nof our\nstock from October 25-29, 2021, the five-day period before\nawards were granted to participants.

In approving the Transformation\nBonus\nProgram, the Compensation Committee did not intend that it would\nbe a replacement, substitution or make-up for any other\ncompensation amount, nor does the Compensation Committee expect\nto make other special awards related to the Transformation in\nthe\nfuture.\n\nThe Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each\nformed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee\nof each Board, to provide oversight of management\u2019s remediation\nefforts under the Consent Orders. The primary focus for the\nfirst part of our remediation efforts involved the development\nof comprehensive\nplans to remediate our regulatory issues and submission of those\nplans to our regulators. The primary focus for the second part\nof our\nremediation efforts involved execution on those plans.\n\nTranche 2 Payout Determination\n\nThe Compensation Committee\ndetermined that the metric categories for the second tranche of\nthe program, covering the calendar year 2023 performance period,\nwere:\n\n\u25cfExecutionof specific actions management must take during Phase\n2 of our remediation plan\n\n\u25cfExecution quality, which is the percentage of milestones\nreviewed by Citi\u2019s Internal Audit function that it deems to be\ncomplete\n\n\u25cfCulture change, which is based on a broad-based employee survey\nthat is designed to measure cultural alignment with our\nLeadership Principles as described on pages 80 and 81\n\nFollowing the completion of the second performance\nmeasurement period under the Transformation Bonus Program, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the Performance\nAchievement Percentage\nfor that period would be 80%, compared to 94% in 2022,\nreflecting the Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of\nperformance relative\nto the predetermined targets.\n\nThe payout of Tranche 2 of the Transformation Bonus\nProgram reflected solid performance in respect of two groups of\nquantitative metrics (Execution and Quality of Execution) equal\nto approximately\n80%, as well as the qualitative consideration of Culture, which\nis informed by the 2023 Voice of the Employee (VOE) Leadership\nIndices\nand which contributed positively to the Compensation Committee\u2019s\ndetermination.\n\nTranche 3 Performance Metrics\n\nThe Compensation Committee has\ndetermined that the metric categories for the third tranche of\nthe program, covering the calendar year 2023 performance period,\nwill\nbe the same as the metric categories for Tranche 2:\n\n\u25cfExecutionof specific actions management must take during Phase\n3 of our remediation plan\n\n\u25cfExecution quality,which is the percentage of milestones\nreviewed by Citi\u2019s Internal Audit function that it deems to be\ncomplete\n\n\u25cfCulture change,which is based on a broad-based employee survey\nthat is designed to measure cultural alignment with our\nLeadership Principles as described on pages 80 and 81\n\nThe Compensation Committee set specific objective targets in\nrespect of performance metrics within those categories early in\n2024.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  96  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \nCompensation Process and Governance\n\nOur Annual Compensation Process\n\nThe following summarizes the principal elements of\nour process for setting incentive compensation for our NEOs.\n\nWe adopted our CART in 2020 as a means for administering\nour new compensation principles and practices. CART is an\nintegral part of our compensation framework that resulted in\nsignificantly increased\ntransparency and discipline with respect to the impact of risk\nand control performance on compensation decisions. CART\u2019s most\nimportant\nfeature is that it requires managers to provide performance\ndetails across each of the four CART pillars \u2013 Risk and Control,\nFinancial,\nClient and Franchise, and Leadership \u2013 to support compensation\ndecisions.\n\nCART creates a comprehensive record evidencing how\nrisk was considered in compensation decisions. This practice\nenables us to systematically hold each manager of an in-scope\nemployee accountable\nin a disciplined way for management of risk and controls and for\ndetermining compensation.\n\nEach named executive officer\u2019s total incentive\naward is based on a market benchmarking process, Citi\u2019s overall\nachievements, and individual executive performance against\napplicable\ngoals. Target compensation is aligned through a market\nbenchmarking process, with market rates of pay adjusted to\nreflect each named executive\nofficer\u2019s experience and scope of role as the starting point for\nincentive pay. Each named executive officer\u2019s performance\nis evaluated against the four pillars and is informed by metrics\ncontained in the executive\u2019s scorecard. The Compensation\nCommittee\nthen considers how performance in each pillar impacts the\nincentive compensation amount and written narrative assessments\nfor each of\nthe four pillars are completed linking pay to performance. The\nCompensation Committee completes this assessment for our CEO and\ncontributes\nto the assessments for our other executive officers.\n\nUnder our compensation framework, our Compensation\nCommittee uses a five-step process when making final\ndeterminations regarding named executive officer incentive\ncompensation. The steps\nare illustrated in the following graphic and summarized\nimmediately below the graphic.\n\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2023  97  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \n                                                                \n  Step 1 \u2013 Goal Setting                                         \n  for Scorecards                                                \n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0The                                                        \n  Compensation Committee approves scorecard goals for each      \n  named executive officer early in the annual compensation      \n  cycle.

The Compensation Committee considers\nnamed\nexecutive officer compensation in the context of pay levels and\nperformance at a 13-member peer group and a smaller core peer\ngroup\nconsisting of five U.S.-based global banks with lines of\nbusiness and scale similar to ours.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with input from its independent\ncompensation consultant, established our compensation peer\ngroup. The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation\npeer group on\nan annual basis to ensure that the group continues to be\nappropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to believe\nthat a U.S.-based\npeer group reflects the relevant market for executive talent and\nthe relevant regulatory environment for our executive\ncompensation.\n\nWe chose the peers because they operate\nin one or more lines of business that are similar to ours and\ncompete in similar labor markets.

Citi\nhas not granted extra years of credited service under any\nretirement plan to any of the NEOs. Ms. Fraser and Messrs.\nSelvakesari and Morton have never been eligible to participate\nin a defined benefit pension plan under the terms of Citi\u2019s\nbroad-based retirement programs in effect in their employment\ncountries; they have participated only in defined contribution\nretirement plans since the commencement of their employment at\nCiti.\n\nThe following describes the pension plans listed in the 2023\nPension Benefits Table.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan.The purpose of this broad-based, tax-\nqualified retirement plan is to provide retirement income on a\ntax-deferred basis to all eligible U.S. employees. Effective\nDecember 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was closed to new\nmembers and generally ceased benefit accruals effective December\n31, 2007. Mr. Mason and Mr. Sieg are eligible for benefits under\nthis plan. Their entire benefits are cash balance benefits.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit is expressed as\na hypothetical account balance. Prior to January 1, 2008, the\nplan generally provided for the annual accrual of benefit\ncredits for most of the covered population, including the\ncovered NEOs, at a rate between 1.5% and 6% of eligible\ncompensation; the benefit credit rate increased with age and\nservice. Eligible compensation generally included base salary\nand incentive awards, but excluded compensation payable after\ntermination of employment, certain non-recurring payments, and\nother benefits. Annual eligible compensation was limited by the\nInternal Revenue Code to $225,000 for 2007 (the final year of\ncash balance benefit accrual). Interest credits continue to be\napplied annually to each participant\u2019s account balance; these\ncredits are based on the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (as\npublished by the Internal Revenue Service).\n\nBenefits under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable in annuity\nform or in other optional forms, including a lump sum, upon\ntermination of employment. The Citigroup Pension Plan\u2019s normal\nretirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant\u2019s\nbenefit determined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula\nmay be paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this\npurpose as the first day of the month after the later of the\nparticipant\u2019s 55th birthday or the date on which the participant\ncompletes a year of service (as defined in the plan).\n\nThe Retirement Plan for Specified Non-United States\nInternational Staff of Citibank, N.A. and Participating\nCompanies (International Staff Plan).The International Staff\nPlan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan\nthat was offered to a select group of management or highly\ncompensated employees. The International Staff Plan provided a\nretirement benefit to internationally mobile staff participating\nin the Citi Expatriate Program who, due to their mobile status,\nwere ineligible for any other Citi defined benefit retirement\nplan. Benefits mirrored the Citibank Retirement Plan and, after\n1999, The Citigroup Pension Plan.

From 1994 through 1999, Mr. Ybarra\naccrued an International Staff Plan benefit determined using the\nCitibank Retirement Plan formula described above, and from 2000\nthrough 2007, Mr. Ybarra accrued an International Staff Plan\nbenefit determined using The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance\nbenefit formula previously described. Limits on eligible\ncompensation and benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code\non tax-qualified retirement plans generally did not apply to\nInternational Staff Plan benefit accruals because the\nInternational Staff Plan is nonqualified; however, the\nInternational Staff Plan was amended over time to include\ncertain limits. Effective January 1, 2000, eligible compensation\nunder the International Staff Plan was limited to $500,000, and\neffective January 1, 2002, the limit on eligible compensation\nimposed by the Internal Revenue Code applied to International\nStaff Plan benefit accruals.\n\nMr. Ybarra is eligible for early retirement under the Citibank\nRetirement Plan formula, meaning that he is eligible for a\nbenefit, actuarially reduced for early commencement, under the\nInternational Staff Plan commencing upon his termination of\nemployment. He is eligible for an unreduced benefit commencing\nimmediately. The International Staff Plan offered lump sum and\nlife annuity distribution options to participants.\n\nPayments upon Termination or Change of Control\n\nGeneral Policies.Citi does not provide guaranteed executive\nseverance or change of control agreements.\n\nPotential Payments Table.Set forth below is a table showing the\nestimated value of outstanding awards that would have been\ndelivered over time to each named executive officer employed by\nCiti on December 31, 2023, had the applicable employment\ntermination or other event occurred on December 31, 2023 and\nassuming that all award vesting and performance conditions are\nsatisfied.

However,     \n     the \u201ccompensation                                          \n     actually paid\u201d in the table above does not reflect the     \n  \u25cf  full extent of the alignment between the compensation we   \n     actually paid and                                          \n     our total stockholder return, because changes in the       \n     value of vested (but unpaid) Deferred Stock Awards are     \n     not reflected in \u201ccompensation                             \n     actually paid\u201d. PSUs, for purposes of the table above, do  \n     reflect such alignment, as the compensation actually paid  \n     for PSUs do fluctuate based on the value of Citi common    \n     stock.                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Changes in the \u201ccompensation actually paid\u201d to each        \n     executive is most impacted by the historical composition   \n     of their compensation                                      \n  \u25cf  packages - specifically, in the percentage of              \n     compensation in the form of PSUs granted to each           \n     executive. PSUs are granted to our EMT, including for      \n     2023 to EMT members residing in the UK.

We did not exclude any countries and we     \n     did not make any adjustments for the                       \n     cost of living. We applied the data used to determine the  \n     2023 median in the calculation                             \n     of the 2023 ratio.                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     SEC                                                        \n     regulations allow employers to identify the midpoint       \n     based on a \u201cconsistently applied                           \n     compensation measure\u201d (CACM).

The initial share authorization under the 2019 Plan was\nintended to support grant activity for at least one year. At the\n2020 Annual Meeting, we requested and received approval for an\nadditional 15 million shares; at the 2021 Annual Meeting we\nrequested and received approval for an additional 20 million\nshares; at the 2022 Annual Meeting we requested and received\napproval for an additional 36 million shares; and at the 2023\nAnnual Meeting we requested and received approval for an\nadditional 28 million shares. In each case, the request was\nintended to support grant activity for one year. Beginning with\nincentive compensation for services rendered in 2021, 100% of\ndeferrals for all employees eligible for annual discretionary\nbonuses were indexed to and paid in Citi stock, where local\nregulations permit. Previously, some incentive compensation was\npaid in deferred cash with interest. Our current share request\nis consistent with our approach on share authorizations, which\nis to request increases as often as annually but only as needed\nto support grant activities for at least one year.\n\nOur Equity Award Practices Are Aligned with Stockholder\nInterests\n                                                                \n     Equity                                                     \n     compensation aligns employee and stockholder interests.\u00a0   \n     Citi\u2019s equity awards are a key component of                \n     annual incentive awards for thousands of employees         \n  \u25cf  worldwide, thereby aligning the interests of stockholders  \n     and a broader group of Citi employees (not just senior     \n     executives).

If Proposal 4 is\napproved by stockholders at our Annual Meeting, we intend to\nfile a registration statement on Form S-8, pursuant to the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, to register the additional\nshares authorized for grant under the 2019 Plan.\n\nGeneral.The 2019 Plan became effective on April 16, 2019 and\nwill expire on the date of the 2024 annual meeting of\nstockholders unless this Proposal 4 is approved by stockholders\nat the 2024 Annual Meeting. The 2019 Plan provides for various\ntypes of awards denominated in shares of Citi common stock to\nCiti employees, officers, and non-employee Directors. The NYSE\nclosing price of a share of Citi common stock on March 4, 2024\nwas $56.14.\n\nAdministration.The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee. All members of such Committee or a sub-committee\nthereof must satisfy the requirements for independence of SEC\nRule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside\nDirectors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board of\nDirectors. The Compensation Committee may delegate some or all\nof its authority over administration of the 2019 Plan to one or\nmore officers, directors, employees, or another plan\nadministrator except with respect to persons who are Section\n16(a) officers. In addition, any special terms or conditions\nthat the Compensation Committee considers necessary or\nappropriate to accommodate differences in non-U.S. law, tax\npolicy or custom may be included in a sub-plan that forms a part\nof the 2019 Plan.\n\nEligibility.All \u201cemployees\u201d of Citi\u2014within the broad definition\nset forth in the instructions to the SEC Form S-8 registration\nstatement, as in effect on April 16, 2019 with respect to the\nCiti or any of its subsidiaries, but expressly excluding\nconsultants and advisors who are not members of the Board of\nDirectors\u2014generally are eligible to receive awards under the\n2019 Plan. Based on worldwide employment at December 31, 2023,\napproximately 239,000 persons could be eligible to participate\nin the 2019 Plan. However, participation is discretionary\u2014awards\nare subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. In\ngeneral, employees with discretionary annual incentive awards of\natleast $75,000 are eligible to receive at least 15% of that\nannual award in\ndeferred stock. For the twelve months ending March 1, 2024,\nawards were made under the 2019 Plan to 12 non-employee\nDirectors, 18\nexecutive officers, and approximately 12,000 employees\nworldwide. Former \u201cemployees\u201d are eligible to participate in the\n2019 Plan, but only with respect to their last year of service\nor in connection with a sale, spin-off or other similar\ntransaction.\n\nShares subject to the 2019 Plan.Shares of Citi common stock\nissued in connection with awards under the 2019 Plan may be\nshares that are authorized but unissued, or previously issued\nshares that have been reacquired, or both. The initial share\nauthorization under the 2019 Plan was 30 million shares.\nPursuant to amendments approved at the 2020 Annual Meeting, the\n2021 Annual Meeting, the 2022 Annual Meeting, and the 2023\nAnnual Meeting, the number of authorized shares increased by 15\nmillion, 20 million, 36 million, and 28 million, respectively.\nPursuant to the amendment described in Proposal 4, the number of\nauthorized shares would increase by 30 million.\n\n\u201cRecycling\u201d provisions.If an award under the 2019 Plan, or,\nafter April 16, 2019 (the effective date of the 2019 Plan), the\n2014 Plan and the 2009 Plan, is forfeited, cancelled, or expires\nor is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject\nto such award will be available for future grants under the 2019\nPlan. However, shares tendered by a participant or withheld by\nCiti to pay an option exercise price, withheld or tendered to\nsatisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any award,\nrepurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds, covered by an\noption or stock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of\nshares actually issued upon exercise), or withheld to satisfy\nany debt or other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled\nfractional shares will be considered issued and shall not be\nadded to the maximum number of shares that may be issued under\nthe 2019 Plan.\n\nLimits on awards.The maximum number of shares subject to awards\nto an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards\nmade at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash\nretainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the\ncalendar year to the Director, in respect of the Director\u2019s\nservice as a member of the Board of Directors during such year\n(including service as a member or chair of any committees of the\nBoard), may not exceed $1 million in value, as determined as of\nthe date of each award.

Pursuant to\nthe amendment described in Proposal 4, the Compensation\nCommittee may make equitable adjustments to any performance\ncondition to the extent needed or appropriate to prevent the\nenlargement or diminution of the rights of participants;\nprovided that in the event of a change of control, such\nadjustment(s) must be made at the time of grant, or prior to, or\ncoincident with, the change of control.\n\nProhibition against repricing.The 2019 Plan prohibits any action\nunder the 2019 Plan that would constitute a \u201crepricing\u201d of any\noutstanding option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, the 2014\nPlan, the 2009 Plan or any other plan of the Company or of any\nacquired company, except with the approval of the stockholders\nof the Company. The 2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d to mean: (i)\nany action that constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d under GAAP or the\nrules of the NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an\noutstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its\nexercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option\nor SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in\nexchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in\nexchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or\n(iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when\nits exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each case other\nthan a permitted equitable adjustment.\n\nProhibition of reload options.The 2019 Plan does not permit the\ngrant of \u201creload\u201d options.\n\nRepayment obligation; right of set-off.If the Compensation\nCommittee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting\nand payment of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an\noption or SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation\nCommittee may cancel such vesting or exercise and refuse to\nissue shares and immediately terminate the participant\u2019s rights\nwith respect to such award (or improperly vested portion\nthereof). If the vesting or exercise of any such award (or\nportion thereof) has already been settled by delivery of shares\nor cash, the participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to\nreturn the shares or cash (or higher value received at vesting\nor exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any shares or cash\nwithheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations.\nConsistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the 2019 Plan also provides for (x) the set-off of\nvested awards against obligations a participant may owe to Citi,\nincluding but not limited to the obligation to repay improperly\nvested or exercised awards, and (y) the set-off of any amount\nrecovered by a participant, and to be paid by the Company, in\nthe nature of severance pay or compensation for hypothetical or\npotential future services in connection with any legal claim or\naction alleging violation of law relating to the participant\u2019s\nemployment or termination thereof (whether by reason of a\ndecision or settlement of such claim) against the pre-tax amount\nthe Company was required to pay for the participant\u2019s account,\nincluding legal fees, in connection with such claim or action.\nAny failure to timely pay tax-related obligations owed to Citi\nin connection with an award may result in its cancellation.\n\nDodd-Frank Act Mandatory Clawback of Erroneously Awarded\nIncentive Compensation.In 2023, the Company adopted the Dodd-\nFrank Clawback Provisions in accordance with the applicable NYSE\nlisting requirements, promulgated pursuant to the final rules\nadopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enacting\nthe clawback standards of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nAccordingly, erroneously awarded incentive compensation,\nincluding equity awards awarded under the 2019 Plan, received by\ncurrent or former executive officers of the Company are subject\nto recovery by the Company to the extent required.\n\nNon-transferability.During the vesting period, awards and sale-\nrestricted shares generally are not transferable other than by\nwill or the laws of descent and distribution.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  PROPOSAL                                                      \n  4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM         123  \n  EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT                                     \n                                                                \nAdjustments.The 2019 Plan provides that the Compensation\nCommittee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the\nmaximum number of shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan\nand to the annual individual award limits expressed in numbers\nof shares in the event of any changes to the Company\u2019s capital\nstructure, including a change in the number of shares\noutstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock split,\nreverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity\nrestructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity\nsecurities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,\nreorganization, or similar transaction or event affecting Citi\u2019s\ncapitalization. In the event of any such transaction or event,\nor any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other\ndistribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to\nstockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate\nequitable adjustments to the number or kind of shares subject to\noutstanding awards, or the exercise prices of outstanding\noptions and SARs, to the extent necessary to prevent the\nenlargement or diminution of participants\u2019 rights.\n\nChange of control.The Compensation Committee may, when an award\nis made, or at any time prior to, or coincident with, a \u201cchange\nof control\u201d (as defined below), provide for the adjustment of\nperformance conditions to prevent the enlargement or diminution\nof participants\u2019 rights, provide for the cancellation of\noutstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring entity\n(or the surviving or acquiring entity\u2019s parent company) replaces\nthe awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value,\nprovide for the acceleration of any time periods or the waiver\nof any other conditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or\ndistribution of an award upon an involuntary termination of a\nparticipant\u2019s employment as a result of a change of control, or\nprovide for the purchase of any award. Pursuant to the\namendments described in Proposal 4, the Compensation Committee\nwould no longer be able to take such action after the time of a\nchange of control, and the Compensation Committee would be\nlimited to only making adjustment(s) of performance conditions\nto the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution\nof participants\u2019 rights. The vesting, payment, purchase, or\ndistribution of an award, however, may not be accelerated by\nreason of a change of control for any participant unless the\nparticipant\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated as a result\nof the change of control. For these purposes, a termination of\nemployment as a result of a change of control means involuntary\ntermination of employment other than for \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in\nthe 2019 Plan) upon, or on or prior to the first anniversary of,\nthe change of control.\n\nThe 2019 Plan defines a \u201cchange of control\u201d to mean (i) a person\nacquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup\nInc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting\npower of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii)\nspecified changes in the majority of the Board (not including\nthe election of Directors whose election or nomination was\napproved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a\nsale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of\nthe assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of\nCitigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization,\nmerger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that\nresults in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than\n50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other\ncorporation resulting from the transaction.\n\nTax withholding.Citi retains the right to deduct or withhold, or\nrequire the participant to remit to his or her employer, an\namount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign\ntaxes (including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-\nequalized expatriates) required by law or regulation to be\nwithheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of the\n2019 Plan.\n\nVoting.The 2019 Plan provides that unless the Compensation\nCommittee determines otherwise, participants who receive issued\nand outstanding shares of Citi common stock that are subject to\ncontinuing restrictions pursuant the terms of a stock award are\ngenerally entitled to direct the voting of the shares underlying\ntheir awards on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. All\nshares underlying such awards as to which no voting instructions\nare received are voted proportionately, based on the voting\ninstructions received with respect to all other such shares.\n\nAmendment and termination.The 2019 Plan may be amended,\nsuspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any\ntime, provided that no amendment shall be made without\nstockholder approval if it would materially increase the number\nof shares available under the 2019 Plan (other than in\nconnection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the\ntypes of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the class of\npersons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially\nextend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method\nof\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n       PROPOSAL                                                 \n  124  4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR, and a TERM         \n       EXTENSION AND RESTATEMENT                                \n                                                                \ndetermining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted under\nthe 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against\n\u201crepricing,\u201d or otherwise require approval by stockholders in\norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or\nprincipal national securities exchange upon which Citi\u2019s common\nstock is traded or quoted).\n\nAward modification.The Compensation Committee retains the right\nto modify outstanding awards without a participant\u2019s prior\nconsent if it determines that the modification is required to\ncomply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance\n(including applicable tax law). Subject to certain exceptions,\nany other modifications, if adverse to a participant, shall not\nbe effective without the participant\u2019s written consent.\n\nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the principal U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences relating to stock options granted under\nthe 2019 Plan, based on current U.S. federal income tax laws.\nThis summary does not constitute tax advice and, among other\nthings, does not describe state, local, or foreign tax\nconsequences, which may be substantially different.\n\nGenerally, a participant will not recognize taxable income on\nthe grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a stock\noption, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an\namount equal to the difference between the fair market value of\nthe Citi common stock received on the date of exercise and the\noption cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the\nexercise price per share). The participant will recognize\nordinary income upon the exercise of the option even though the\nshares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale\nor transferability. Citi will ordinarily be entitled to a\ndeduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount\nof ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise,\nexcept as may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Generally, upon a subsequent sale of shares\nacquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale\nproceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be taxable\nas a capital gain or loss, including any sale of shares freed\nfrom sale restrictions to fund the payment of taxes incurred at\nexercise. The 2019 Plan does not provide for awards of\n\u201cincentive stock options,\u201d which have different tax consequences\nunder the Internal Revenue Code.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n       \n  125  \n       \nStockholder Proposals\n\nCiti makes every effort to be responsive to concerns expressed\nby our stockholders by engaging in dialogues, participating in\nissuer/investor working groups, and adopting policies or\ninitiatives we believe to be in the best interests of all\nstockholders. Over the years, Citi has met with several\nproponents and other interested parties regarding such issues as\ngender pay equity, proxy access, human rights, climate change,\nnet zero, racial equity, culture, risk management, auditor\nrotation, trade association payments, diversity and inclusion\nrisks, and viewpoint diversity, among others, and has, on\ncertain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in response to\nthese engagements and/or stockholder votes. For example, in\n2021, Citi collaborated with a stockholder to outline the scope\nof a Racial Equity Audit for its Action for Racial Equity\ncommitments and in 2019, Citi\u2019s Board of Directors lowered the\nSpecial Meeting threshold in response to the stockholder vote at\nthe 2019 Annual Meeting. We encourage our stockholders to\ncommunicate with management and the Board. Any stockholder\nwishing to communicate with management, the Board, or an\nindividual Director, or obtain the addresses of any of the\nstockholder proponents or their Citi stock ownership\ninformation, should send a request to the Corporate Secretary,\nBrent J.

Boeing then adopted this proposal\ntopic.\n\nManagement says it supports having an independent Director in a\nBoard leadership position. However management inconsistently has\na bylaw that allows it to indefinitely have one person hold the\n2 most important jobs at Bank of America as long as there is a\nso-called lead director.\n\nThe so-called lead director could then have excessive board\ntenure that would impair director independence. The lead\ndirector could also be a person who staunchly believes the 2\nmost important jobs in a $80 Billion company like Citigroup\nshould be held by one person and that the person holding the 2\npositions at once should be given the upmost deference.\n\nA lead director is no substitute for an independent board\nchairman. A lead director cannot call a special shareholder\nmeeting and cannot even call a special meeting of the board. A\nlead director can delegate most of his lead director duties to\nothers and then simply rubber-stamp it. There is no way\nshareholders can be sure of what goes on.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  126  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nA lead director can be given a list of duties but there is no\nrule that prevents the Chairman from overriding the lead\ndirector in any of the so-called lead director duties.\n                        Please vote yes:                        \n                                                                \n            Independent Board Chairman \u2013 Proposal 5             \nManagement Comment\nSummary                                                         \nSince 2009, Citi has had an independent Board Chair, separate\nfrom its CEO. The Board firmly supports having an independent\nDirector in a Board leadership position at all times. As such,\nCiti\u2019s Board, on December 15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment\nwhich provides that if Citi does not have an independent Chair,\nthe Board will elect an independent Lead Director having similar\nduties to an independent Chair, including leading the executive\nsessions of the non-management Directors at Board meetings.\nCiti\u2019s Board has determined that the current structure, an\nindependent Chair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate\nstructure at this time, while ensuring that, at all times, there\nwill be an independent Director in a Board leadership position.\nSince Citi\u2019s Board has adopted a framework that provides for\neither an independent Chair or an independent Lead Director, the\nBoard believes that this Proposal is not necessary.\nImportant Points to Consider                                    \n                                                                \n     As                                                         \n     required by Citi\u2019s By-Laws, the Board elects its Chair     \n     annually, and, for each of the                             \n     past 14 years, the Board has elected an independent        \n     director to serve as Board Chair. Citi\u2019s                   \n     By-Laws ensure that there will be an independent member    \n     of the Board in a leadership position                      \n  \u00d8  at all times. Rather than formally separating the roles    \n     of CEO and Chair, it is in the best                        \n     interests of Citi\u2019s stockholders to retain flexibility to  \n     determine the optimal leadership                           \n     structure at any given time, while ensuring that an        \n     independent Board member oversees the                      \n     Board. The Board values the flexibility of selecting the   \n     structure of leadership best suited                        \n     to meet the needs of the Company and its stockholders.     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     If                                                         \n     the roles of Chair and CEO were combined, Citi\u2019s           \n     Guidelines provide that the Board                          \n  \u00d8  would designate a lead director from among the             \n     independent directors. As set forth in the                 \n     Guidelines, the duties of the independent Lead Director    \n     and the non-executive chair include,                       \n     but are not limited to, the following functions:           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     presiding                                                  \n  \u00fc  at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not     \n     present, including executive sessions                      \n     of the independent Directors;                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     serving                                                    \n  \u00fc  as liaison between the Executive Chair and the             \n     independent Directors;                                     \n                                                                \n                                     \n  \u00fc  approving                       \n     information sent to the Board;  \n                                     \n                                     \n  \u00fc  approving                       \n     meeting agendas for the Board;  \n                                     \n                                                                \n     approving                                                  \n  \u00fc  meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time  \n     for discussion of all agenda items;                        \n     and                                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     having                                                     \n  \u00fc  the authority to call meetings of the independent          \n     Directors.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi                                                       \n     has an empowered independent Board that provides           \n     oversight.

Though Citigroup adheres to the Equator Principles to\nmanage environmental and social risk, Indigenous experts have\ndescribed them as \u201ccritically weak\u201d and not aligned with\ninternational human rights standards. 14Effective policies that\nprotect Indigenous rights are critical to managing material\nrisk.\n                                                                \n     https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/de\u2026  \n  1  ;                                                          \n     https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files\u2026  \n  2  ;                                                          \n     https://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/usa-\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  4  https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Brief\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                         \n  5  https://www.stopline3.org/news/women-leaders-line5  \n                                                         \n                                                                \n  6  https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  7  https://www.baymills.org/_files/ugd/869f65_f8e5288d82084\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  8  https://narf.org/nill/documents/20210510BayMills_banish_\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  128  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \n                                                                \n  9  https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2022/06/13/united-n\u2026  \n     ; https://narf.org/bay-mills-line5-pipeline/               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  10  https://www.desmog.com/2022/04/26/existential-threat-in\u2026  \n      oil/#:~:text=Between%202016%20and%202020%2C%20Citigroup\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      https://exitamazonoilandgas.org/                          \n  11  ;                                                         \n      https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/07/13/oil-comes-first\u2026  \n      not-indigenous-rights/                                    \n      https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/more-than-470-oil-spi\u2026  \n      ;                                                         \n      https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/colombian-protesters\u2026  \n  12  ;                                                         \n      https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-frontera-energy-oi\u2026  \n      ;                                                         \n      https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-frontera-energy/up\u2026  \n  13  https://www.stand.earth/latest/forest-conservation/amaz\u2026  \n  14  https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2019/11/19/first-p\u2026  \n                                                                \nManagement Comment\nSummary                                                         \nThe Proposal requests that Citi prepare a report to\nstockholders outlining the effectiveness of Citi\u2019s policies,\npractices, and performance indicators in respecting\ninternationally\nrecognized human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples.

The Company has established in its bylaws a\nmajority vote standard for use in an uncontested director\nelection, an election in which the number of nominees equal the\nnumber of open board seats. Under applicable state corporate\nlaw, a director\u2019s term extends until his or her successor is\nelected and qualified, or until he or she resigns or is removed\nfrom office. Therefore, an incumbent director who fails to\nreceive the required vote for election under a majority vote\nstandard continues to serve as a \u201choldover\u201d director until the\nnext meeting of shareholders. A Company resignation bylaw\ncurrently addresses the continued status of an incumbent\ndirector who fails to be re-elected by requiring such director\nto tender his or her resignation for Board consideration.\n\nThe proposed new director resignation bylaw will set a more\ndemanding standard of review for addressing director\nresignations then that contained in the Company\u2019s current\nresignation bylaw. The resignation bylaw will require the\nreviewing directors to articulate a compelling reason or reasons\nfor not accepting a tendered resignation and allowing an un-\nelected director to continue to serve as a \u201c\u201choldover\u201d director.\nImportantly, if a director\u2019s resignation is not accepted and he\nor she continues as a \u201choldover\u201d director but again fails to be\nelected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that\ndirector\u2019s new tendered resignation will be automatically\neffective 30 days following the election vote certification.\nWhile providing the Board latitude to accept or not accept the\ninitial resignation of an incumbent director that fails to\nreceive majority vote support, the amended bylaw will establish\nthe shareholder vote as the final word when a continuing\n\u201choldover\u201d director is not re-elected. The Proposal\u2019s\nenhancement of the director resignation process will establish\nshareholder voting in director elections as a more consequential\ngovernance right.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  130  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nManagement Comment\n\nSummary\n\nThe amendments to the By-Laws contemplated by the Proposal would\nrequire that, in situations where the Board finds compelling\nreasons not to accept a director\u2019s tendered resignation and the\ndirector thus continues as a \u201choldover\u201d director, if such\ndirector fails to receive a majority of the votes cast at the\nnext annual meeting of stockholders, such director\u2019s resignation\n\u201cwill be automatically effective 30 days after the certification\nof the election vote.\u201d\n\nThe Board carefully considered the Director Resignation By-Law\nAmendment Proposal and concluded, for the reasons noted below,\nthat a blanket prohibition on nominating a holdover director if\nhe or she fails to secure a majority vote would not be in the\nbest interests of the Company and our stockholders. In 2006,\nCiti adopted a majority vote standard for uncontested Director\nelections and amended our By-Laws to include a director\nresignation requirement. The director resignation requirement\nprovides that a nominee in an uncontested election who is not\nelected by a majority vote shall offer to resign from his or her\nposition as a Director. Unless the Board decides to reject the\noffer or to postpone the effective date, the resignation becomes\neffective 60 days after the date of the election. Under the By-\nLaws, if the Board rejects the Director\u2019s resignation, it must\npublicly state its reasons for doing so. The Board continues to\nbelieve that having a director resignation provision in its By-\nLaws is a best practice that ensures the appropriate level of\ncontinuity for the Board, while giving the Board the authority\nto exercise its fiduciary duties in determining whether or not\nto accept a holdover director\u2019s resignation. Each member of the\nBoard has fiduciary duties to the Company\u2019s stockholders,\nincluding ensuring that the Board members collectively possess\nskill sets that are directly relevant to the Company\u2019s business\nand strategic objectives at any given time. In meeting this\nresponsibility, the Board must act in the best interests of its\nstockholders to ensure that the Board composition is appropriate\nto provide oversight of Citi.\n\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s                                                     \n     Board is committed to good governance practices, which is  \n     why our By-Laws expressly provide                          \n     for a director resignation policy that permits the Board   \n     to use its collective judgment to                          \n     accept or reject a holdover director\u2019s resignation by      \n     considering the circumstances                              \n     that may drive the election outcome and the potential      \n     composition of the Board if the resignation                \n     were accepted. The automatic resignation of a given        \n     director may also negatively affect Citi\u2019s                 \n     regulatory and other compliance systems, particularly a    \n     resignation that affects the composition,                  \n  \u00d8  collective experience, and performance of our board        \n     committees. This Proposal would remove                     \n     the ability of the Board to exercise its judgment and      \n     make the determination automatic, thereby                  \n     limiting the decision-making authority of Citi\u2019s Board of  \n     Directors in contravention                                 \n     of its fiduciary duties. The Proposal would limit the      \n     Board\u2019s range of action on these                           \n     (and other) important issues. An automatic resignation     \n     may be unnecessary and inadvisable                         \n     if the directors, acting in real-time and in accordance    \n     with their fiduciary duties, determine                     \n     a better alternative is available to address stockholder   \n     concerns.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The                                                        \n     automatic removal of a holdover director removes Board     \n     members\u2019 ability to exercise                               \n     their considered judgment in determining whether to        \n     accept such a resignation. The amendment                   \n     contemplated by the Proposal is significantly              \n     restrictive, as it would provide that the director\u2019s       \n  \u00fc  resignation \u201cwill be automatically effective 30 days       \n     after\u201d a holdover director                                 \n     fails to receive a majority of the votes cast at the next  \n     annual meeting of stockholders.                            \n     As such, the Proposal impermissibly seeks to limit the     \n     Board\u2019s ability to assess the                              \n     election and the impact of the resignation to the Board    \n     and the\u00a0Company.                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The                                                        \n     Board believes that an automatic removal of a holdover     \n     director, irrespective of any special                      \n  \u00fc  situations that are outside of a director\u2019s control that   \n     may have impacted the election                             \n     results, could have a chilling effect on both current and  \n     future Boards and would not be                             \n     in the best interests of Citi or its stockholders.         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi                                                       \n     has a very extensive Investor Engagement Program as        \n     disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

Harvardon June 29, 2023,\nthat discriminating on the basis of race in college admissions\nviolates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 1\n\nAttorneys General of 13 States warned Fortune 100 companies on\nJuly 13, 2023, that SFFAimplicated corporate diversity, equity,\nand inclusion (DEI) programs. 2\n\nPrior legal advice regarding the legality of racially\ndiscriminatory programs has been called into question post-\nSFFA. 3\n\nRecent analysis of American Fortune 100 hiring in the wake of\nthe 2020 race riots found that whites were excluded from 94% of\nthe hiring decisions, 4a statistic that itself providesprima\nfacieproof of illegal discrimination on the basis of race by\nthese companies, given that whites constitute 76% of the\nAmerican population. 5\n\nA review of Citi\u2019s website on Nov. 13, 2023, revealed the\nfollowing: (1) Citi CEO Jane Fraser stating that: \u201cI\u2019m\ncompletely committed to supporting our affirmative action\nprogram \u2026.\u201d 6(2) \u201cAVAILABLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\u201d listing eight\ncareer development programs that facially discriminate on the\nbasis of race/sex/gender, with straight White males apparently\nnot eligible for any of these resource allocations. 7(3)\nDiscussion of \u201cmore than $1 billion in strategic initiatives\u201d\napparently intended to allocate Citi resources on the basis of\nrace in order to \u201chelp close the racial wealth gap.\u201d 8\n\nRESOLVED:\n\nShareholders ask that the board commission and publish a report\non (1) whether the Company engages in any practices directly or\nindirectly associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion\n(DEI) initiatives that may create risks of discriminating\nagainst individuals who might sue the Company (including\nemployees, suppliers, contractors, and retained professionals)\nfor illegal discrimination on the basis of protected categories\nlike race and sex, and (2) the potential costs of such\ndiscrimination to the business.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:\n\nIn just the past year, a corporation was successfully sued for a\nsingle case of discrimination against a white employee resulting\nin an award of more than $25 million. 9The risk of being sued\nfor such discrimination appears only to be rising. 10With over\n230,000 employees, 11Citi likely has at least 170,000 employees\nwho are potentially the victims of this type of illegal\ndiscrimination because they are white, Asian, male, or straight.\n12Accordingly, even if only 10 percent of such employees were to\nfile suit, and only 10 percent of those prove successful, the\ncost to the company could\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  132  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nexceed $42 billion. And while racial equity audits can cost up\nto $4 million, this report should cost much less, as it need\nreview only the potentially discriminatory programs, unless Citi\nhas established so many such programs that its liability for\nthis discrimination must be expected to be much higher.\n                                                                \n  1  https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/students-for\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  2  https://ag.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/corporat\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://freebeacon.com/democrats/starbucks-hired-eric-ho\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  4  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-black-lives-matt\u2026  \n     https://www.dailywire.com/news/bloomberg-flubs-data-for-\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  5  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045222  \n                                                                \n                                                     \n  6  https://www.citigroup.com/global/eeo-aa-policy  \n                                                     \n                                                                \n  7  https://www.citigroup.com/global/our-impact/diversity-eq\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  8  https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2020\u2026  \n     the-racial-wealth-gap                                      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  9  https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/starbucks-manager-s\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      See, e.g.,                                                \n      https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-files-class-act\u2026  \n      ;                                                         \n  10  https://aflegal.org/afl-files-federal-civil-rights-comp\u2026  \n      hiring-practices-and-sends-letter-to-activision-board-d\u2026  \n      ;                                                         \n      https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-files-federal-c\u2026  \n      fiduciary-duties/                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  11  https://www.citigroup.com/global/about-us/global-presen\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  12  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST0452\u2026  \n                                                                \nManagement Comment\n\nSummary\n\nThe Proposal requests that Citi\u2019s Board \u201ccommission and publish\na report on (1) whether the Company engages in any practices\ndirectly or indirectly associated with diversity, equity, and\ninclusion (DEI) initiatives that may create risks of\ndiscriminating against individuals who might sue the Company\n(including employees, suppliers, contractors, and retained\nprofessionals) for illegal discrimination on the basis of\nprotected categories like race and sex, and (2) the potential\ncosts of such discrimination to the business.\u201d The Proposal\nasserts that certain of Citi\u2019s DEI programs result in illegal\nracial discrimination, pointing to, for example, Citi\u2019s career\ndevelopment programs that allegedly \u201cfacially discriminate on\nthe basis of race/sex/gender, with straight White males\napparently not eligible for any of these resource allocations\u201d\nand Citi\u2019s investment of more than $1 billion in strategic\ninitiatives that are \u201capparently intended to allocate Citi\nresources on the basis of race in order to \u2018help close the\nracial wealth gap.\u201d The Supporting Statement further claims that\nCiti\u2019s DEI programs could result in significant legal liability\nfrom employees \u201cwho are potentially the victims of \u2026 illegal\ndiscrimination because they are white, Asian, male, or\nstraight.\u201d\n\nCiti disagrees with the Proposal\u2019s assertion that its diversity,\nequity and inclusion programs are unlawful. Citi has a long-\nstanding commitment to following equal employment opportunity\nprinciples and to complying with the full range of laws\nregarding fair employment practices and non-discrimination. Citi\nfully understands its obligation to provide equal employment\nopportunities and to not engage in unlawful conduct in\nestablishing and implementing diversity, equity and inclusion\ninitiatives. Citi continues to review and refine those policies\nand practices in light of the evolving legal landscape and\nbusiness needs.\n\nThe proponent mischaracterizes Citi\u2019s commitment to diversity,\nequity, and inclusion by suggesting that its diversity, equity\nand inclusion programs are unlawful. Citi\u2019s policies are\ndesigned to emphasize that our personnel are expected to respect\nthe beliefs, identity and values of others. Citi prohibits\ndiscrimination and harassment against its employees in all\nforms, regardless of whether or not individual protections are\nlegally mandated in the countries\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  133  \n                              \nand communities where it operates.

The UN Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that\n\u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and\nreligion.\u201d 1These guarantees are an important part of protecting\nevery American\u2019s freedom of speech and free exercise of\nreligion.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  134  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nAs shareholders of Citigroup, we believe the company must\nprovide financial services on an equal basis without regard to\nfactors such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or\nsocial, political, or religious views.\n\nWe are concerned with recent evidence of religious and political\ndiscrimination against customers by companies in the financial\nservices industry, as seen in recent examples 2and the 2022\nStatement on Debanking and Free Speech. 3\n\nCitigroup\u2019s charitable giving policy 4excludes religious\norganizations. As noted in the 2023 Viewpoint Diversity Score\nBusiness Index 5, \u201ccharitable giving policies [ought not] bar\nnonprofits from receiving support simply because of their\nreligious status.\u201d\n\nAs per the 1792 Exchange\u2019s report 6, which lists the Corporation\nas \u2018High Risk\u2019, Citigroup \u201cdoes not protect its employees from\nviewpoint discrimination.\u201d This lack of protection raises\nserious concerns over the possibility of politicized debanking\nwhich Citigroup shareholders have a right to have assuaged.\n\nIn the 2023 Viewpoint Diversity Index, 7Citigroup maintains a\nscore of 0 (out of 100) in its respect for viewpoint diversity\nin the public square. In the workplace, Citigroup scores 12,\nwith the report noting that \u201cno publicly accessible policy\naffirms a minimum degree of respect for freedom of religion and\nviewpoint diversity in the workforce.\u201d This lack of respect for\nviewpoint diversity can snowball into concerns over debanking of\npolitically inconvenient clients.\n\nIn early 2023, shareholders called for Chase, Mastercard,\nPayPal, Capital One, and Charles Schwab to assess whether they\nhave adequate safeguards to prevent politicized de-banking.\n8Nineteen state attorneys general and fourteen state financial\nofficers specifically called out Chase for their de-banking of a\nnon-profit committed to advancing religious freedom and demanded\naction from the company to address such widespread concerns. 9\n\nThe Index notes that Citigroup \u201cdid not respond\u201d to a request\nfor increased transparency in the Company\u2019s procedures regarding\n\u201crestricting services or content.\u201d In absence of clearer\nprotocols, Citigroup could be the next corporation to run such\nreputational risk.\n\nValue for shareholders must take priority over activist demands.\n\nR ESOLVED: Shareholders request that Citigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the\nnext year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary\ninformation and disclosure of anything that would constitute an\nadmission of pending litigation, evaluating how it oversees\nrisks related to discrimination against individuals based on\ntheir race, color, religion (including religious views), sex,\nnational origin, or political views, and whether such\ndiscrimination may impact individuals\u2019 exercise of their\nconstitutionally protected civil rights.\n                                                                \n  1  https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     https://adflegal.org/press-release/bank-america-boots-ch\u2026  \n     https://www.newsweek.com/stop-troubling-trend-politicall\u2026  \n  2  https://www.dailymail.                                     \n     co.uk/news/article-12314423/The-Coutts-Farage-dossier-ba\u2026  \n     Ricky-Gervais-trans-joke-Novak-Djokovic-ties-decide-odds\u2026  \n     https://familycouncil. org/?p=25159                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://storage.googleapis.com/vds_storage/document/Stat\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  4  https://storage.googleapis.com/vds_storage/document/evid\u2026  \n     Guidelines_The-Citi-Foundation-Doesn-not-provide-funding\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  5  https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/news/how-they-sc\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                             \n  6  https://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=859  \n                                             \n                                                                \n  7  https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/company/citigroup  \n                                                                \nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  135  \n                              \n                                                                \n     https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-\u2026  \n     pdf pg. 100\u2013101;

Among other things, the statement cites to a\nthird-party report alleging that Citi does not adequately\nprotect its employees from viewpoint discrimination. The\nproponents conclude that such a \u201cfailure\u201d supports a conclusion\nthat Citi could engage in politicized de-banking with respect to\nits clients. The statement also cites to a report that\nincorrectly states that Citigroup does not have a \u201cpublicly\naccessible policy [that] affirms a minimum degree of respect for\nfreedom of religion and viewpoint diversity of its workforce.\u201d\n\nCiti agrees that it has an obligation to provide financial\nservices in a non-discriminatory manner but disagrees with the\nstatements that it has failed to adopt\u2014or disclose\u2014appropriate\npolicies demonstrating its commitment to conducting its business\nin a non-discriminatory manner both with respect to its clients\nand its own workforce. Through disclosure of its Code of\nConduct, and other reports including the Proxy Statement, Citi\nhas already appropriately disclosed how it prohibits unlawful\ndiscrimination against individuals based on race, color,\nreligion (including religious views), sex, national origin or\npolitical views, as well as how it protects employee viewpoint\nexpression.

It is also impossible to assess future risk\nwithout the\ndisclosure of the right information.\u201d\n\nTo minimize these risks, some banks are taking animal welfare\nissues into account as part of their lending due diligence\npractices.\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  137  \n                              \nHowever, Citi\u2019s oversight on animal welfare is miniscule,\nat best. Citi\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy Framework\ndiscusses due diligence regarding financing that potentially\nimpacts critical\nhabitat and areas of high conservation value, and \u201ctraceability\u201d\nin beef supply chains. However, this due diligence\nis limited to \u201careas of high caution\u201d and \u201csensitive\necoregions\u201d, failing to address the welfare of\nanimals involved. Consideration for biodiversity and habitat\nloss in sensitive ecoregions does notequate\nto consideration for animal welfare.\n\nFurther, \u201canimal welfare\u201d is never mentioned in any\nof Citi\u2019s reports, policies, or governance documents.\n\nThough peers like Wells Fargo & Goldman Sachs perform abysmally\nregarding animal welfare, Citi performs even worse with a score\nof \u201c0\u201d, according to the Banks for Animals scorecard.\nGoldman notes financing to plant-based companies, and Wells\nFargo has Sustainable Finance Eligibility criteria, whereas Citi\ndoes not\nand is seemingly lacking oversight in numerous key areas\nrelating to animal welfare, including but not limited to \u201cAnimal\nFarming and Food Production\u201d and \u201cAnimal\nTesting\u201d.\n\nAlternatively, banks like Triodos and de Volksbank established\nspecific exclusionary criteria to reduce exposure to animal\ncruelty and its associated risks.\n\nSimply because a process is not disclosed, does not necessarily\nindicate a lack of due diligence. However, neglecting to\npublicly acknowledge oversight on animal welfare risks the\nperception of our\ncompany\u2019s failure of oversight on critical issues. Publicly\nasserting how Citigroup addresses the issue of animal welfare\nwhen considering\nfinancing decisions would not only increase transparency but\nenhance Citi\u2019s overall reputation.\n\nResolved: Shareholders\nrequest that Citigroup publish a report at reasonable expense\nand excluding proprietary and privileged information, disclosing\nwhether and how the Board of Directors exercises its oversight\nregarding material risks associated with animal welfare.\n                                                                \n  1  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-ani\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     New Animal Welfare Cause: How to Avoid Future Risk and     \n     Hold Businesses Accountable, Published on May 12, 2021.    \n  2  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-ani\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Env\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  4  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Glo\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                          \n  5  https://banksforanimals.org/institutions/citigroup/  \n                                                          \n                                                                \n  6  https://www.triodos.com/en/articles/2022/triodos-bank-up\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  7  https://static.devolksbank.nl/files/Guide-ASN-Sustainabi\u2026  \n                                                                \nManagement Comment\nSummary                                                         \nThe proposal requests that Citi publish a report disclosing\nwhether\nand how the Board of Directors exercises its oversight regarding\nmaterial risks associated with animal welfare.

In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Citi may\nsolicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, and similar\nmeans. No Director,\nofficer, or employee of Citi will be specially compensated for\nthese activities. Citi also intends to request that brokers,\nbanks, and\nother nominees solicit proxies from their principals and will\npay the brokers, banks, and other nominees certain expenses they\nincur for such activities. Citi has retained Morrow Sodali LLC,\na proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation of\nproxies, for an estimated fee of\n$30,000 plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nHouseholding\n\nUnder SEC rules, a single set of Annual Reports and\nProxy Statements or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials, as applicable, may be sent to any household at which\ntwo or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of\nthe same\nfamily. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy\ncard. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the\nvolume\nof duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces\nmailing and printing expenses. In accordance with a notice sent\nto certain\nstockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report\nand Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials, as applicable, will be sent to that address unless\nany\nstockholder at that address requested multiple sets of documents\nbe sent. However, if any stockholder who agreed to householding\nwishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement,\nhe or she may telephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to\nBroadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51\nMercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717.

To the extent that a number of shares\nof Common\nStock sufficient to satisfy a tax withholding obligation of the\nCompany may not be withheld (whether because the Award has not\nvested\nin full pursuant to its terms, administrative procedures in\neffect at such time, applicable accounting principles, or any\nother reason),\nthe Company shall have the right to condition the obligation of\nthe Company to issue shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of\nan Option\nor a SAR, or in settlement of any vested Award, on the\nParticipant paying to the Company, on demand, such amount as may\nbe requested by\nthe Company for the purpose of satisfying any actual tax\nwithholding (or hypothetical tax) liability.

Other Benefit and Compensation Programs\n\nAwards granted under the Plan and amounts received\nupon vesting or exercise of an Award shall not be deemed a part\nof a Participant\u2019s regular, recurring compensation for purposes\nof calculating payments or benefits under any Company benefit\nplan or severance program unless specifically provided for under\nthe plan or program.\nUnless\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                \n  162  ANNEX B  \n                \nspecifically set forth in an Award Agreement, Awards under the\nPlan are not intended as payment for compensation that otherwise\nwould have been delivered in cash, and even if so intended, such\nAwards shall be subject to such vesting requirements and other\nterms,\nconditions, restrictions, and limitations as may be provided in\nthe Award Agreement.\n\n16. Unfunded Plan\n\nUnless otherwise determined by the Committee, the\nPlan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to\ncreate) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not\nestablish\nany fiduciary relationship between the Company and any\nParticipant or other person. To the extent that any Participant\nholds any rights\nby virtue of an Award granted under the Plan, such rights shall\nconstitute general unsecured liabilities of the Company and\nshall not\nconfer upon any Participant or any other person or entity any\nright, title, or interest in any assets of the Company.\n\n17. Expenses of the Plan\n\nThe expenses of the administration of the Plan shall\nbe borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may\nrequire Subsidiaries to pay for the Common Stock issued under\nthe Plan to\nParticipants employed (or formerly employed) by such\nSubsidiaries.\n\n18. Rights as a Stockholder\n\nUnless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant\nshall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to\nshares of Common Stock covered by an Award until the date the\nParticipant becomes\nthe holder of record with respect to such shares. No adjustment\nwill be made for dividends or other rights for which the record\ndate is\nprior to such date, except as provided in Section 6(d) or\nSection 8.\n\n19. Future Rights\n\nNo Employee shall have any claim or right to be granted\nan Award under the Plan. There shall be no obligation of\nuniformity of treatment of Employees under the Plan. Further,\nthe Company and\nits Subsidiaries may adopt other compensation programs, plans,\nor arrangements as they deem appropriate or necessary. The\nadoption of\nthe Plan or the granting of any Award shall not confer upon any\nEmployee any right to continued employment in any particular\nposition\nor at any particular rate of compensation, nor shall it\ninterfere in any way with the right of the Company or a\nSubsidiary to terminate\nthe employment of its Employees at any time, free from any claim\nor liability under the Plan. Unless expressly provided otherwise\nelsewhere\nin the Plan or in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan\nshall be made in anticipation of future service and/or subject\nto other vesting\nconditions and will not be earned until all conditions to\nvesting have been satisfied.\n\n20. Amendment and Termination\n\nThe Plan may\nbe amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the\nCommittee, provided that no amendment shall be made without\nstockholder approval,\nif it would (a) materially increase the number of shares\navailable under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section 6(d)),\n(b) materially\nexpand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c)\nmaterially expand the class of persons eligible to participate\nin the Plan,\n(d) materially extend the term of the Plan, (e) materially\nchange the method of determining the exercise price of an Award,\n(f) delete\nor limit the Plan\u2019s prohibition against Repricing, or (g)\notherwise require approval by the stockholders of the Company in\norder\nto comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock\nExchange (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the New York\nStock\nExchange, the principal national securities exchange upon which\nthe Common Stock is then traded or quoted). No such amendment\nreferred\nto above shall be effective unless and until it has been\napproved by the stockholders of the Company. The Committee\nretains the right\nto modify an Award without a Participant\u2019s prior consent if it\ndetermines that the modification is required to comply with\napplicable\nlaw, regulation, or regulatory guidance\nCiti 2024 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n              \n  ANNEX  163  \n  B           \n              \n(including applicable tax law). Except as may be provided\nby Section 7(e), Section 11, and this Section 20, any other\nadverse modification shall not be effective without the\nParticipant\u2019s\nwritten consent. The Company shall furnish or make available to\nParticipants a written notice of any modification through a\nbrochure,\nprospectus supplement, or otherwise, which notice shall specify\nthe effective date of such modification.\n\n21. Successors and Assigns\n\nThe Plan and any applicable Award Agreement entered\ninto under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the\nbenefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of\nParticipants,\nincluding, without limitation, the executors, administrators, or\ntrustees of a Participant\u2019s estate, or any receiver or trustee\nin bankruptcy or representative of a Participant\u2019s creditors.\n\n22. Governing Law\n\nThe Plan and all Award Agreements entered into under\nthe Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by\nthe laws of the State of New York, except that any principles or\nprovisions\nof New York law that would apply the law of another jurisdiction\n(other than applicable provisions of U.S. federal law) shall be\ndisregarded.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, matters with respect to\nindemnification, delegation of authority under the Plan, and the\nlegality of shares\nof Common Stock issued under the Plan, shall be governed by the\nDelaware General Corporation Law.\n\n23. Tax Compliance\n\nAwards granted hereunder shall comply with or be exempt\nfrom Section 409A of the Code, unless otherwise determined by\nthe Committee. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to\nSection 409A\nof the Code, a Participant is entitled to receive a payment on a\nspecified date, such payment shall be deemed made as of such\nspecified\ndate if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such\nspecified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year\nin which such\nspecified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth day of the\nthird month following such specified date; provided that the\nParticipant\nshall not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the\ntaxable year in which such payment is made. If, pursuant to any\nAward\nthat is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a Participant is\nentitled to a series of installment payments, such Participant\u2019s\nright\nto the series of installment payments shall be treated as a\nright to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a\nsingle payment.\nFor purposes of the preceding sentence, the term \u201cseries of\ninstallment payments\u201d has the same meaning as provided in\nSection 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)\nof the regulations promulgated under the Code. Notwithstanding\nany provision of this Plan to the contrary, in no event shall\nthe Company\nor any Subsidiary be liable to a Participant on account of an\nAward\u2019s failure to (a) qualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax\ntreatment,\nor (b) avoid adverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law,\nincluding, without limitation, Sections 409A and 457A of the\nCode.\n\n24. Severability\n\nIf any provision of this Plan is finally held to be\ninvalid, illegal, or unenforceable (whether in whole or in\npart), such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent,\nbut only to the\nextent, of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, and\nthe remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby; provided\nthat,\nif any such provision is finally held to be invalid, illegal, or\nunenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope determined to\nbe acceptable\nto permit such provision to be enforceable, such provision shall\nbe deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary in order to\nmake such\nprovision enforceable.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n       \n  164  \n       \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n       \n  165  \n       \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n       \n  166  \n       \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \nCITIGROUP INC. 3800 CITIGROUP CENTER DRIVE\nBLDG G, MAIL ZONE G3-23\nTAMPA, FL 33610-9122\n                         \n  SCAN TO                \n  VIEW MATERIALS & VOTE  \n                         \nVOTE BY INTERNET -\nwww.proxyvote.com or from a\nmobile phone scan the QR code\nabove Use the Internet to\ntransmit your voting\ninstructions and for electronic\ndelivery of information up\nuntil 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time\non April 29, 2024.
