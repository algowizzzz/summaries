Executive\nSummary, during the first\nquarter of 2023:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues increased\n12% versus the prior-year\nperiod, including a gain on\nsale of Citi\u2019s India consumer\nbanking business versus a loss\nrelated to the sale of Citi\u2019s\nAustralia consumer banking\nbusiness in the prior-year\nperiod (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cFirst\nQuarter of 2023 Results\nSummary\u201d below). Excluding\nthese divestiture-related\nimpacts, revenues increased\n6%, primarily driven by higher\nnet interest income, partially\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenues.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased 1%\nversus the prior-year period,\nincluding divestiture-related\nimpacts in both the current\nand prior-year periods (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cFirst Quarter of 2023 Results\nSummary\u201d below). Excluding\nthese divestiture-related\nimpacts, expenses increased\n5%, primarily driven by\ncontinued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, other\nrisk and control investments,\ninflation and severance costs,\nall partially offset by the\nbenefit of productivity\nsavings, foreign exchange\ntranslation and expense\nreduction from the closed exit\nmarkets and wind-downs (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cExpenses\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\n$2.0 billion versus $0.8\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase reflected\na net build of $0.7 billion in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) for loans and\nunfunded commitments and other\nprovisions, compared to a net\nACL release of $0.1 billion in\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by\nmacroeconomic deterioration\nand growth in card revolving\nbalances, and higher net\ncredit losses, primarily\ndriven by ongoing\nnormalization in Branded cards\nand Retail services.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $1.0 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio increased\nto 13.4% as of March 31, 2023,\ncompared to 11.4% as of March\n31, 2022 (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below). This\ncompares to Citi\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nof 12.0% as of January 1, 2023\nunder the Basel III\nStandardized Approach.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nfurther progress on its\nconsumer banking business\ndivestitures in the first\nquarter of 2023, including,\namong other things, completing\nthe sales of its India and\nVietnam consumer banking\nbusinesses and working toward\nclosing two additional sale\ntransactions in 2023, as well\nas progressing with the\ncontinued wind-downs of the\nKorea and China consumer\nbanking businesses and the\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbusinesses.\n                                                                \n  First Quarter of 2023 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $4.3 billion, or $2.02 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase in net\nincome was primarily driven by\nthe higher revenues, partially\noffset by the higher expenses\nand the higher cost of credit.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas approximately 25% in the\ncurrent quarter, including the\nimpact of divestitures, versus\n18% in the prior-year period,\nwhich had higher discrete tax\nbenefits (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cIncome\nTaxes\u201d below). Earnings per\nshare (EPS) increased 8%,\nreflecting the higher net\nincome and an approximate 1%\ndecline in average diluted\nshares outstanding.\n\nResults for the first quarter\nof 2023 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $953\nmillion in earnings before\ntaxes ($648 million after-\ntax), primarily recorded in\nLegacy Franchises , reflecting\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 $1,018 million of net\ndivestiture gains, primarily\nrelated to a gain on sale of\nthe India consumer banking\nbusiness, recorded in revenues\n\n\u2022 $73 million of aggregate\ndivestiture-related costs,\nrecorded in expenses\n\n\u2022 An $8 million benefit of\ndivestiture-related credit\ncosts\n\n\u2022 $305 million of related\ntaxes\n\nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$0.33 positive impact on EPS\nin the current quarter.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was\n$1.86. (As used throughout\nthis Form 10-Q, Citi\u2019s results\nof operations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof divestiture-related impacts\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nResults for the first quarter\nof 2022 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $(677)\nmillion in earnings before\ntaxes ($(588) million after-\ntax), recorded in Legacy\nFranchises , reflecting the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 A $118 million pretax loss\nprimarily related to the Asia\nmarkets, recorded in revenues;\nthis pretax loss reflected an\nACL release of $(104) million\nand a net revenue impact of\n$(14) million due to\ncontractual adjustments\n\n\u2022 A $71 million cost of credit\nreclassification to revenues,\nas once a divestiture is\nclassified as held-for-sale,\ncredit costs, including ACL\nbuilds/releases and net credit\nlosses, are reclassified to\nrevenues\n\n\u2022 A $535 million goodwill\nimpairment recorded in\nexpenses, due to the re-\nsegmentation and sequencing of\ndivestitures, as well as $24\nmillion of costs related to\nthe Korea voluntary early\nretirement program, also\nrecorded in expenses\n\n\u2022 $(89) million of related tax\nbenefits\n                               3                                \nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$(0.30) negative impact on EPS\nin the prior-year period.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was\n$2.32.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $21.4\nbillion in the first quarter\nof 2023 increased 12% from the\nprior-year period. As\ndiscussed above, reported\nrevenues included net\ndivestiture gains of\napproximately $1.0 billion\nthis quarter, primarily\nrelated to the gain on sale of\nthe India consumer banking\nbusiness, compared to a loss\nof $47 million primarily\nrelated to the Asia markets in\nthe prior-year period, both\nrecorded in Legacy Franchises\n. Excluding these impacts,\nrevenues increased 6%,\nreflecting strength across\nServices and Fixed income\nmarkets in Institutional\nClients Group (ICG) , as well\nas strong average loan growth\nin U.S. Personal Banking in\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement (PBWM). The higher\nrevenues were partially offset\nby a decline in Investment\nbanking and Equity markets in\nICG and lower investment\nproduct revenues in Global\nWealth Management (Global\nWealth) in PBWM , as well as\nimpacts from the closed exit\nmarkets and wind-downs in\nLegacy Franchises .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $652 billion, down\n1% versus the prior-year\nperiod, as growth in PBWM was\nmore than offset by a decline\nin ICG and Legacy Franchises .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, largely\nunchanged versus the prior-\nyear period, as a decrease in\nPBWM , largely reflecting\nGlobal Wealth clients\nreallocating deposits to\nhigher-yielding investments on\nthe business\u2019s platform, was\noffset by an increase in\ninstitutional certificates of\ndeposit in Corporate/Other.\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s deposits by\nbusiness, including drivers\nand deposit trends, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cLiquidity\nRisk\u2014Deposits\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $13.3 billion increased 1%\nfrom the prior-year period. As\ndiscussed above, reported\noperating expenses included\n$73 million of divestiture-\nrelated costs this quarter,\ncompared to $559 million in\nthe prior-year period, both\nrecorded in Legacy Franchises\n. Excluding these divestiture-\nrelated costs, expenses\nincreased 5%, largely driven\nby the following:\n\n\u2022 Approximately 1% by\ncontinued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, largely\nrelated to risk and controls,\ndata and finance programs.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 4% by\nstructural expenses, largely\nin compensation and benefits,\nwhich included the full-year\nimpact of hiring in the prior\nyear, as well as hiring in the\nfirst quarter of 2023; and the\nimpact of inflation and\nseverance costs.\n\nThe increase in expenses was\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings, lower\nbusiness-led investments and\nthe impact of foreign exchange\ntranslation, as well as\nexpense reduction from the\nclosed exit markets and wind-\ndowns in Legacy Franchises .\n\nAs previously announced, Citi\nexpects to incur higher\nexpenses in 2023, primarily\nreflecting continued\ninvestments\n\nin Citi\u2019s transformation,\nother risk and control\ninvestments, volume-related\nexpenses and inflation.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $2.0\nbillion, compared to $0.8\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. This increase\nreflected higher net credit\nlosses (see below) and a net\nbuild of $0.7 billion in the\nACL for loans and unfunded\ncommitments and other\nprovisions, primarily driven\nby macroeconomic deterioration\nand growth in card revolving\nbalances in PBWM . This\ncompared to a net ACL release\nand other provisions of $(0.1)\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $1.3\nbillion increased 49% from the\nprior year. Consumer net\ncredit losses of $1.3 billion\nincreased 52%, reflecting\nongoing normalization,\nparticularly in Branded cards\nand Retail services. Corporate\nnet credit losses decreased to\n$22 million from $31 million.\n\nCiti also expects to incur\nhigher net credit losses in\n2023, primarily driven by\ncontinued normalization toward\npre-pandemic levels,\nparticularly in the cards\nbusiness in PBWM .\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.4% as of March 31,\n2023, compared to 11.4% as of\nMarch 31, 2022, based on the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income, the impacts\nfrom the closing of the Asia\nconsumer banking business\nsales, and business actions,\nincluding a reduction in RWA,\npartially offset by the\npayment of common dividends.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of March 31,\n2023 was 6.0%, compared to\n5.6% as of March 31, 2022. The\nincrease was driven by higher\nTier 1 Capital, partially\noffset by a slight increase in\nTotal Leverage Exposure.

TTS\nrevenues of $3.4 billion\nincreased 31%, driven by 41%\ngrowth in net interest income\nand 13% growth in non-interest\nrevenue. Strong performance in\nTTS was driven by higher\ninterest rates and business\nactions, including growth in\ndeposits, managing repricing\nand growth in fees. Securities\nservices revenues of $1.1\nbillion increased 23%, as net\ninterest income increased 94%,\ndriven by higher interest\nrates across currencies, and\nwere partially offset by a 6%\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue due to the impact of\nlower settlement volumes and\nlower market valuations on\nassets under custody and\nadministration.\n\nMarkets revenues of $5.6\nbillion decreased 4%, as\ngrowth in Fixed income markets\nwas more than offset by a\ndecline in Equity markets.\nFixed income markets revenues\nof $4.5 billion increased 4%,\nprimarily driven by strength\nin rates and currencies,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in spread products\nand other fixed income. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.1\nbillion declined 25%,\nprimarily reflecting reduced\nclient activity in cash and\nequity derivatives relative to\na strong quarter in the prior-\nyear period.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.2\nbillion decreased 38%,\nincluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges in the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding the gain\n(loss) on loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $1.4 billion\ndecreased 21%, driven by lower\nrevenues in Investment banking\nand Corporate lending.\nInvestment banking revenues of\n$774 million decreased 25%,\nreflecting a decline in the\noverall market wallet, as\ncontinued geopolitical\nuncertainty, heightened\nmacroeconomic uncertainty and\nvolatility continued to impact\nclient activity. Corporate\nlending revenues decreased\n54%, including the impact of\nthe gain (loss) on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof the gain (loss) on loan\nhedges, Corporate lending\nrevenues decreased 14% versus\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby lower volumes and higher\nhedging costs.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nICG for the first quarter of\n2023, see \u201c Institutional\nClients Group \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Personal Banking and Wealth Management                        \n                                                                \nPBWM net income of $489\nmillion decreased 74%, driven\nby higher cost of credit and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by higher revenues.\nPBWM operating expenses of\n$4.3 billion increased 9%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol investments and\nseverance costs, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nPBWM revenues of $6.4 billion\nincreased 9%, primarily due to\nhigher net interest income,\ndriven by strong loan growth\nacross U.S. Personal Banking,\npartially offset by a decline\nin non-interest revenue,\nprimarily driven by lower\ninvestment product revenues in\nGlobal Wealth.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nof $4.7 billion increased 18%.\nBranded cards revenues of $2.5\nbillion increased 18%,\n\nprimarily driven by the higher\nnet interest income, as card\nspend volume increased 9% and\naverage loans increased 15%.\nRetail services revenues of\n$1.6 billion increased 24%,\nprimarily driven by the higher\nnet interest income.

On\nMay 1, 2023, the FDIC\nannounced that its Deposit\nInsurance Fund will incur\nadditional costs related to\nthe resolution of First\nRepublic Bank. The FDIC did\nnot indicate how it proposes\ncovering these costs, but\nFirst Republic Bank was not\nresolved under special\nemergency provisions.\nCitibank, N.A. could incur an\nincrease in its non-interest\nexpense from the imposition of\nadditional costs by the FDIC,\nalthough the amount of such\ncosts is not yet known or\nreasonably estimable.\n\nIn addition, Citi could incur\na significant loss on sale due\nto currency translation\nadjustment (CTA) losses (net\nof hedges) in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(loss) (AOCI) , allocated\ngoodwill and intangibles and\nother AOCI loss components\nrelated to the potential\nsigning of a sale agreement\nfor its remaining consumer\nbanking divestitures.

example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges include the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market\non the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed\npremium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate\nlending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection.\nCitigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the impact of gain\n(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n                               13                               \nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges\nof accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the\ntable above.\n                                                                \n  1Q23 vs. 1Q22                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $3.3 billion\nincreased 23%, primarily\ndriven by lower cost of credit\nand higher revenues, partially\noffset by higher expenses.\n\nRevenues increased 1%\n(including gain (loss) on loan\nhedges), driven by higher\nServices revenues, partially\noffset by lower Banking and\nMarkets revenues. Services\nrevenues were up 29%, driven\nby higher revenues in both TTS\nand Securities services.\nBanking revenues were down 38%\n(including the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges),\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending. Markets\nrevenues were down 4%, driven\nby Equity markets, partially\noffset by higher Fixed income\nmarkets revenues.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 31%,\ndriven by 41% growth in net\ninterest income and 13% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\nreflecting strong growth\nacross all client segments.\nThe increase in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates and\nbusiness actions, including\ngrowth in deposits and\nmanaging repricing. Average\ndeposits increased 5%, largely\ndriven by growth in EMEA and\nNorth America. Average loans\ndecreased 2%, largely\nreflecting loans sales,\nprimarily in North America.\nThe increase in non-interest\nrevenue was primarily due to\nstrong fee growth across both\nthe cash and trade businesses,\nreflecting solid client\nengagement and continued\ngrowth of underlying drivers,\nwith U.S. dollar clearing\nvolumes up 6%, cross-border\nflows up 10% and commercial\ncard spend up 40%.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 23%, as net interest\nincome grew 94%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies. The increase in\nrevenues was partially offset\nby lower non-interest revenues\n(decrease of 6%), driven by\nlower settlement volumes\n(decline of 3%), along with\nlower market valuations on\nassets under custody and\nadministration. The decline in\nnon-interest revenue was\npartially offset by higher\nexisting client activity and\nnew client onboarding and\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nservices.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 4%, driven\nby growth in rates and\ncurrencies, primarily in North\nAmerica, partially offset by a\ndecline in spread products and\nother fixed income, primarily\nin North America and EMEA.\n\nRates and currencies increased\n13%, driven by the rates\nbusiness, reflecting increased\ninterest rate volatility,\npartially offset by a decline\nin the currencies business due\nto a strong prior-year\ncomparison. Spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues decreased 24%, due to\ndecreased institutional and\ncorporate client activity in\nspread products and a decline\nin commodities, primarily\n\nin North America, driven by\ndecreased volatility against a\nstrong prior-year comparison.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 25%, driven by\nequity derivatives, primarily\nreflecting lower activity in\nboth corporate and\ninstitutional clients compared\nto a strong prior-year period.\nThe lower revenues also\nreflected a decline in equity\ncash, driven by lower\ninstitutional client activity.\nPrime finance balances\ncontinued to grow in the\nquarter.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndeclined 25%, reflecting a\ndecline in the overall market\nwallet, as continued\ngeopolitical uncertainty,\nheightened macroeconomic\nuncertainty and volatility\ncontinued to impact client\nactivity. Advisory revenues\ndecreased 17%, reflecting a\ndecline in North America and\nAsia, partially offset by\ngrowth in EMEA. The decrease\nin advisory revenues was\ndriven by the lower market\nwallet, partially offset by\nwallet share gains. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 41%, reflecting a\ndecline in North America, Asia\nand EMEA, driven by the\ndecline in the market wallet\nas well as wallet share loss.\nDebt underwriting revenues\ndecreased 24%, reflecting a\ndecline in North America and\nEMEA, driven by the decline in\nthe market wallet, partially\noffset by wallet share gains\nlargely in the investment-\ngrade portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 54%, including the\nimpact of the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 14%, primarily\ndriven by lower volumes and\nhigher hedging costs.\n\nExpenses increased 4%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol investments, volume-\nrelated expenses and other\nstructural expenses, including\nseverance costs, partially\noffset by productivity savings\nand the impact of foreign\nexchange translation.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $72 million, compared to\ncosts of $971 million in the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by an ACL release for\nloans and unfunded lending\ncommitments and other\nprovisions, compared to an ACL\nbuild in the prior-year\nperiod. Net credit losses were\n$22 million, compared to $30\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nThe ACL release was $94\nmillion, compared to a build\nof $941 million in the prior-\nyear period. The year-over-\nyear decrease in the ACL build\nwas due to the absence of\nRussia-related ACL builds in\nthe prior-year period. The $94\nmillion ACL release for the\nquarter was driven by a net\nACL release for loans and\nunfunded lending commitments\nof $245 million, primarily due\nto reductions in Russia loan\nexposures, partially offset by\n$151 million related to an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n                               14                               \nFor additional information on\nICG \u2019s corporate credit\nportfolio, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in ICG \u2019s deposits and\nloans, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u2014Loans\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Deposits\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to ICG \u2019s\nfuture results, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above, \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Russia\u201d and \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d below and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022\nForm 10-K.\n                               15                               \n                                                                \n  PERSONAL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT                        \n                                                                \nPersonal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) consists of U.S.\nPersonal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth).\nU.S. Personal Banking includes Branded cards and Retail\nservices, which have the following proprietary cards portfolios:\nCash, Rewards and Value portfolios and co-branded cards within\nBranded cards (including American Airlines and Costco), and co-\nbrand and private label relationships within Retail services\n(including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears and\nMacy\u2019s).

and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by higher revenues.\n\nRevenues increased 9%,\nprimarily due to higher net\ninterest income, driven by\nstrong loan growth across U.S.\nPersonal Banking. The increase\nwas partially offset by lower\nnon-interest revenue,\nprimarily reflecting lower\ninvestment product revenues in\nGlobal Wealth.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nincreased 18%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in both cards\nand Retail banking.\n\nCards revenues increased 20%.\nBranded cards revenues\nincreased 18%, primarily\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome on higher card spend\nvolumes and higher loan\nbalances. Branded cards new\naccount acquisitions increased\n17% and card spend volumes\nincreased 9%. Average loans\nincreased 15%, reflecting the\nhigher card spend volumes and\nlower payment rates.\n\nRetail services revenues\nincreased 24%, primarily\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome on higher loan\nbalances. Retail services card\nspend volumes decreased 3% and\naverage loans increased 10%,\nreflecting lower payment\nrates.\n\nRetail banking revenues\nincreased 3%, primarily driven\nby higher mortgage revenue and\nstrong growth in installment\nlending, partially offset by\nthe impact of the transfer of\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nGlobal Wealth. Average loans\nincreased 14%, primarily\ndriven by higher mortgage\noriginations. Average deposits\ndecreased 6%, reflecting the\ntransfer of relationships and\nthe associated deposit\nbalances to Global Wealth.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues\ndecreased 9%, largely\nreflecting investment product\nrevenue headwinds and lower\nnet interest income in the\nPrivate bank. Average deposits\ndecreased 2% and average loans\ndecreased 1%. The decline in\naverage deposits largely\nreflected Global Wealth\nclients reallocating deposits\nto higher-yielding investments\non the business\u2019s platform,\npartially offset by the\ntransfer of deposit\nrelationships from Retail\nbanking. Client assets\ndecreased 4%, driven by\ndeclines in equity market\nvaluations and lower deposits.\nGlobal Wealth continued to\ngrow client advisors, which\nincreased 3%. Private bank\nrevenues decreased 27%, driven\nby the investment product\nrevenue headwinds and higher\ninterest rates paid on\ndeposits. In addition, Wealth\nat Work revenues increased 5%\nand Citigold revenues\nincreased 4%.\n\nExpenses increased 9%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol investments and\nseverance costs, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $1.6 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $376\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by a\nnet ACL build for loans and\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses increased 58%,\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels,\nparticularly in Branded cards\n(net credit losses up 72% to\n$521 million) and Retail\nservices (net credit losses up\n95% to $491 million).\n\nThe net ACL build was $0.5\nbillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $1.1 billion in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by a deterioration in\nmacroeconomic assumptions and\ngrowth in U.S. cards revolving\nbalances.

Asia Consumer provides traditional retail\nbanking and branded card products to retail and small business\ncustomers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail\nbanking and branded card products to consumers and small\nbusiness customers and traditional middle-market banking\nproducts and services to commercial customers through\nCitibanamex.\n\nLegacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer\nbanking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its\nclosing on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on\nAugust 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on\nNovember 1, 2022; Bahrain, until its closing on December 1,\n2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1,\n2023.\n\nIn addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its\nconsumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has\ncontinued to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking\noperations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local\ncommercial banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2\nfor additional information on Legacy Franchises \u2019 consumer\nbanking business sales and wind-downs.\n\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s consumer and local commercial banking\nwind-down in Russia, Citi expects to incur approximately $210\nmillion in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from\nany portfolio sales), of which $150 million relates to Legacy\nFranchises , largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination\nfees and other related charges. Citi\u2019s previously disclosed\nreferral agreement with a Russian bank to settle a portfolio of\nruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer\nconsents, can be terminated under certain circumstances and is\nbeing reevaluated as Citi reviews other alternatives. The credit\ncard loans will remain held-for-investment as Citi continues to\nexplore pathways to accelerate the wind-down in a manner that is\ncompliant with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements.\nFor additional information about Citi\u2019s continued efforts to\nreduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see \u201c\nInstitutional Clients Group \u201d above and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d below, as well as \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nAt March 31, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had\n1,406 retail branches, $20 billion in retail banking loans and\n$53 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9\nbillion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had\n$8 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan\nand deposit amounts exclude approximately $10 billion of loans\n($9 billion of retail banking loans and $1 billion of credit\ncard loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits,\nall of which were reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (e.g., as\nOther assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet) as a result of Citi\u2019s entry into agreements to sell\ncertain remaining consumer banking businesses.

The\nincrease in net income was\nprimarily driven by higher\nrevenues, partially offset by\nlower discrete income tax\nbenefits, higher cost of\ncredit and higher expenses.\n\nRevenues were $914 million,\ncompared to $190 million in\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by higher net\nrevenue from the investment\nportfolio, largely due to\nhigher interest rates.\n\nExpenses increased 19%,\nprimarily driven by\ntransformation and other risk\nand control investments,\npartially offset by lower\nconsulting expenses.\n\nProvisions were $111 million,\nprimarily driven by a reserve\nbuild related to the uninsured\ndeposit with First Republic\nBank.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to\nCorporate/Other \u2019s future\nresults, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above, \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d below and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                               20                               \n                                                                \n  CAPITAL RESOURCES                                             \n                                                                \nFor additional information\nabout capital resources,\nincluding Citi\u2019s capital\nmanagement, regulatory capital\nbuffers, the stress testing\ncomponent of capital planning\nand current regulatory capital\nstandards and developments,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2023, Citi returned a total of\n$1.0 billion of capital to\ncommon shareholders in the\nform of dividends.

Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio under the\nAdvanced Approaches (using the\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) increased\nto 10.5%.

Facility risk ratings are assigned that\nreflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors\nthat affect the loss given default of the facility, such as\nsupport or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally\ncorrespond to BBB and above are considered investment grade,\nwhile those below are considered non-investment grade.\n                               35                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\nby facility risk rating as a\npercentage of the total\ncorporate credit portfolio:\n                                                                \n                    Total                                       \n                 exposure          December                     \n                March 31,               31,       March 31,     \n                     2023              2022            2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             50  %             50  %           49  %  \n  BBB                  33                34              33     \n  BB/B                 15                14              16     \n  CCC or                2                 2               2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %            100  %          100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the obligor and\nfacility risk ratings assigned\nto all exposures, Citi may\nclassify exposures in the\ncorporate credit portfolio.\nThese classifications are\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the U.S.\nbanking regulators\u2019 definition\nof criticized exposures, which\nmay categorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful or loss. Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of March 31,\n2023. Citi has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

The portfolio is\ngenerally delinquency managed,\nwhere Citi evaluates credit\nrisk based on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral.

As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nbanking for the first quarter\nof 2023 increased quarter-\nover-quarter, primarily due to\na decrease in recoveries and\nnormalization of losses in the\npersonal loan portfolio, and\ndecreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof industry-wide episodic\noverdraft losses in the prior-\nyear period. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nU.S. mortgages, which\nreflected the lasting effects\nof government stimulus,\nunemployment benefits and\nconsumer relief programs.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nAs discussed above, the Global\nWealth credit portfolio\nprimarily consists of consumer\nmortgages, cards and other\nlending products extended to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom the affluent to ultra-\nhigh-net-worth through the\nPrivate bank, Wealth at Work\nand Citigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, approximately\n$49 billion, or 33%, of the\nportfolio was classifiably\nmanaged and primarily\nconsisted of margin lending,\ncommercial real estate,\n\nsubscription credit finance\nand other lending programs.\nThese classifiably managed\nloans are primarily evaluated\nfor credit risk based on their\ninternal risk rating, of which\n93% is rated investment grade.\nWhile the delinquency rate in\nthe chart above is calculated\nonly for the delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio, the net\ncredit loss rate is calculated\nusing net credit losses for\nboth the delinquency and\nclassifiably managed\nportfolios. As shown in the\nchart above, the net credit\nloss rate in Global Wealth for\nthe first quarter of 2023\ndecreased slightly quarter-\nover-quarter, due to a\nclassifiably managed loan\ncharge-off in the prior\nquarter, while the net credit\nloss rate year-over-year was\nbroadly stable. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nreflecting the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nThe low levels of net credit\nlosses and the 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate continued\nto reflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nLegacy Franchises Legacy\nFranchises provides\ntraditional retail banking and\nbranded card products to\nretail and small business\ncustomers in Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer.\n                   \n  Asia(1)Consumer  \n                   \n(1) Asia Consumer includes\nLegacy Franchises activities\nin certain EMEA countries for\nall periods presented. As\nshown in the chart above, the\nnet credit loss rate in Asia\nConsumer (for the remaining\nconsumer banking portfolios\nheld-for-investment (China,\nKorea, Russia and Poland)) for\nthe first quarter of 2023\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year. The\nincreases were primarily\ndriven by lower average loans\ndue to the ongoing wind-downs\nof the remaining businesses,\nparticularly Korea, and the\nreclassification of a\nportfolio to HFS in the first\nquarter of 2023. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, mainly\ndriven by lower loans due to\nthe ongoing wind-downs of the\nremaining businesses and the\nreclassification of a\nportfolio to HFS in the first\nquarter of 2023.

As shown in\nthe chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Mexico\nConsumer for the first quarter\nof 2023 increased quarter-\nover-quarter and year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the\ngradual normalization of loss\nrates after peak losses\nexperienced during the\npandemic.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $80 million ($0.6 billion), $89 million ($0.6\nbillion) and $161 million ($0.9 billion) at March 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $57 million, $70 million and $62 million at March\n31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March\n31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, 93%, 96% and 92%\nof Global Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated\ninvestment grade. For additional information on the credit\nquality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably\nmanaged portfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain\nEMEA countries for all periods presented.\n                               44                               \n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22\n(Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and\nVietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was\nreclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for\nadditional information.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $81 million ($0.3 billion), $90 million ($0.3\nbillion) and $124 million ($0.4 billion) at March 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $30 million, $37 million and $35

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.

End-of-period deposits\nwere largely unchanged year-\nover-year, as a decrease in\nPBWM , largely reflecting\nGlobal Wealth clients\nreallocating deposits to\nhigher-yielding investments on\nthe business\u2019s platform, was\noffset by an increase in\ninstitutional certificates of\ndeposit in Corporate/Other.\nEnd-of-period deposits\ndecreased 3% sequentially,\nreflecting seasonal activity\nin TTS and the reallocation of\nGlobal Wealth clients\u2019\ndeposits to higher-yielding\ninvestments. On a sequential\nbasis, end-of-period deposits\nwere down $36 billion,\nprimarily driven by ICG ,\nlargely reflecting seasonal\nclient activity. The majority\nof Citi\u2019s $1.3 trillion of\nend-of-period deposits are\ninstitutional (approximately\n$819 billion), and span 90\ncountries. A large majority of\nthese institutional deposits\nare within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from\nclients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments\nand collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital\nsolutions. In addition, nearly\n80% of TTS deposits are from\nclients that have a greater\nthan 15-year relationship with\nCiti. Over the past year, TTS\ndeposits grew at a faster rate\nthan total Citi deposits on\nboth an average and end-of-\nperiod basis. Citi also has a\nstrong consumer and wealth\ndeposit base, with $437\nbillion of U.S. Retail banking\nand Global Wealth deposits as\nof end-of-period, which are\ndiversified across the Private\nbank, Citigold, Retail banking\nand Wealth at Work. As of\nyear-end 2022, approximately\n75% of U.S. Citigold clients\nhave been with Citi for more\nthan 10 years and\napproximately 50% of Private\nbank ultra-high-net-worth\nclients have been with Citi\nfor more than 10 years. U.S.\nPersonal Banking deposits are\nspread across six core urban\ncenters. Long-Term Debt The\nweighted-average maturity of\nunsecured long-term debt\nissued by Citigroup and its\naffiliates (including\nCitibank) with a remaining\nlife greater than one year was\napproximately 7.5 years as of\nMarch 31, 2023, compared to\n8.5 years as of the prior year\nand 7.6 years as of the prior\nquarter. The weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the contractual maturity of\neach security. For securities\nthat are redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable. Citi\u2019s\nlong-term debt outstanding at\nthe Citigroup parent company\nincludes benchmark senior and\nsubordinated debt and what\nCiti refers to as customer-\nrelated debt, consisting of\nstructured notes, such as\nequity- and credit-linked\nnotes, as well as non-\nstructured notes. Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities. Citi\u2019s long-term\ndebt at the bank includes bank\nnotes, FHLB advances and\nsecuritizations.\n\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding The\nfollowing table presents\nCiti\u2019s end-of-period total\nlong-term debt outstanding for\neach of the dates indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of                Mar. 31,         Dec. 31,         Mar. 31,  \n  dollars               2023             2022             2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-bank\u2026                                                     \n  Benchmark                                                     \n  debt:                                                         \n  Senior       $       117.1    $       117.5    $       122.2  \n  debt                                                          \n  Subordin\u2026             22.7             22.5             24.7  \n  debt                                                          \n  Trust                  1.6              1.6              1.6  \n  preferred                                                     \n  Customer\u2026            109.7            101.1             78.4  \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                8.7              7.8              7.8  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $       259.8    $       250.5    $       234.7  \n  non-bank                                                      \n  Bank                                                          \n  FHLB         $         7.3    $         7.3    $         1.0  \n  borrowin\u2026                                                     \n  Securiti\u2026              6.6              7.6              9.5  \n  Citibank                                                      \n  benchmark              2.6              2.6              3.5  \n  senior                                                        \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                3.4              3.6              5.3  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $        19.9    $        21.1    $        19.3  \n  bank                                                          \n  Total                                                         \n  long-term    $       279.7    $       271.6    $       254.0  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nNote: Amounts represent the\ncurrent value of long-term\ndebt on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that, for\ncertain debt instruments,\nincludes consideration of fair\nvalue, hedging impacts and\nunamortized discounts and\npremiums.

As of March 31,\n2023, non-bank included $92.9\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries that\nare consolidated into\nCitigroup. Certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities are also included\nin this line. (2) Local\ncountry and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s\naffiliates in support of their\nlocal operations. Within non-\nbank, certain secured\nfinancing is also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Branded cards\nreceivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\nincreased 10% year-over-year,\nlargely driven by the issuance\nof customer-related debt at\nthe non-bank entities and\nincreased FHLB borrowings at\nthe bank. The increase was\npartially offset by a decline\nin senior benchmark debt at\nboth the bank and non-bank\nentities, as well as lower\nsecuritizations at the bank.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding increased 3%,\nlargely driven by the issuance\nof customer-related debt at\nthe non-bank entities. As part\nof its liability management,\nCiti has considered, and may\ncontinue to consider,\nopportunities to redeem or\nrepurchase its long-term debt\npursuant to open market\npurchases, tender offers or\nother means. Such redemptions\nand repurchases help reduce\nCiti\u2019s overall funding costs.\nDuring the first quarter of\n2023, Citi redeemed or\nrepurchased an aggregate of\napproximately $4.8 billion of\nits

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $258\nbillion as of March 31, 2023\nincreased 26% year-over-year\nand 27% sequentially, largely\ndriven by additional financing\nto support increases in\ntrading-related assets within\nCiti\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. As of the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023,\non an average basis, secured\nfunding was $224 billion. The\nportion of secured funding in\nthe broker-dealer subsidiaries\nthat funds secured lending is\ncommonly referred to as\n\u201cmatched book\u201d activity and is\nprimarily secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other \u201cmatched\nbook\u201d activity is secured by\nless liquid securities,\nincluding equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-\nbacked securities, the tenor\nof which is generally equal to\nor longer than the tenor of\nthe corresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $40 billion as of the first\nquarter of 2023 increased 33%\nyear-over-year, reflecting an\nincrease in FHLB advances and\ncommercial paper issuance.\nShort-term borrowings\ndecreased 15% sequentially,\nreflecting a decline in\noutstanding FHLB advances (see\nNote 17 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               57                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below shows the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of March 31, 2023.\nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.3\nbillion, compared to $0.4\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured funding\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\nimpacted.\n\nIn total, as of March 31,\n2023, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.6 billion, compared to $0.9\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022 (see also Note 20). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of March 31,\n2023, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$10.9 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, compared to $11.0\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022 (see Note 19 for\nadditional information).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could\nreevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis reevaluation could result\nin clients adjusting their\ndiscretionary deposit levels\nor changing their depository\ninstitution, which could\npotentially reduce certain\ndeposit levels at Citibank.\nHowever, Citi could choose to\nadjust pricing, offer\nalternative deposit products\nto its existing customers or\nseek to attract deposits from\nnew customers, in addition to\nthe mitigating actions\nreferenced above.\n                               58                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nSince the third quarter of\n2022, Citi has employed\nenhanced IRE methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nICG \u2019s Markets businesses).\nThese changes resulted in a\nhigher impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income over a\n12-month period.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas), are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR).

For U.S.\ndollars, exposure to downward\nparallel rate shocks is larger\nin magnitude than to upward\nrate shocks. This is because\nof the lower benefit to net\ninterest income from Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base at higher rate\nlevels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. For other\ncurrencies, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because the combination of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nchanges related to Citi\u2019s\npension liabilities, results\nin a net position that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               61                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.6 billion,\nor 0.91%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro and Indian\nrupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies.\n\nThis, coupled with Citi\u2019s\nforeign currency hedging\nstrategies, such as foreign\ncurrency borrowings, foreign\ncurrency forwards and other\ncurrency hedging instruments,\nlessens the impact of foreign\ncurrency movements on Citi\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

The\nincrease in ICG Markets net\ninterest income largely\nreflected a change in the mix\nof trading positions in\nsupport of client activity.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest margin was\n2.41% on a taxable equivalent\nbasis in the first quarter of\n2023, an increase of 2 basis\npoints from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof higher interest rates and\ngrowth in U.S. Cards

The benefit reflects the\nfact that the risks within individual and across risk types are\nnot perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a\ngiven day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to\neach risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of\nchanges to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination\nof the impact of both model parameter and position changes.\n\n(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain\nfair value option trading positions in ICG , with the exception\nof hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all\nCVA exposures.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of March 31, 2023, there were two back-\ntesting exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. LIBOR Transition\nRisk On April 3, 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\nannounced its decision to require the LIBOR administrator, ICE\nBenchmark Administration Limited (IBA), to continue the\npublication of one\u2010, three\u2010 and six\u2010month USD LIBOR after June\n30, 2023 using an unrepresentative synthetic methodology. The\nsynthetic USD LIBOR rates are expected to cease on September 30,\n2024. The publication of synthetic USD LIBOR would provide\nadditional time for certain USD LIBOR contracts to be remediated\nor mature. During April 2023, certain central counterparties\n(CCPs) completed conversions of certain USD LIBOR-cleared\nderivatives to alternative reference rate positions, with the\nremaining cleared derivative conversions expected to be\ncompleted in May 2023. In addition, on February 27, 2023, Citi\nprovided notice that, after the June 30, 2023 cessation date,\nthe relevant USD LIBOR rate for certain debt securities,\ncertificates of deposit, preferred stock, asset-backed\nsecurities and trust preferred securities issued by Citigroup\nInc. and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries is planned to\nbe replaced with the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for\nthe one-, three- or six-month tenor corresponding to the\nrelevant USD LIBOR rate as administered by CME Group Benchmark\nAdministration, Ltd., plus a tenor spread adjustment.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers.

Citi is unable to\nremit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the\nRussian government.\n\n(6) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit\nliabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.\n\n(7) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its\nindirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above\ntable, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would\nbe recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings only upon either the\nsubstantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank.\nCiti has separately described these risks in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               73                               \nDuring the first quarter of\n2023, Citi continued to reduce\nits operations in Russia and\nRussia-related exposures,\nresulting in a net decrease in\ntotal Russia exposure of $1.4\nbillion, as shown in the table\nabove, as well as a change in\nthe composition of its\nexposure as mitigation efforts\nhave reduced Citi\u2019s third-\nparty credit risk (see\ndiscussion below). The\nsequential decline in exposure\nwas driven by (i) a $0.5\nbillion decrease due to\ndepreciation of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar, (ii)\ndecreases in local currency\nterms of a $1.3 billion\nreduction in deposits held\nwithin the Central Bank of\nRussia driven by client\ndeposit withdrawals, (iii) a\n$0.2 billion decrease due to\nloan repayments and sales,\n(iv) a $0.3 billion reduction\nin reverse repo balances and\n(v) a $0.1 billion reduction\nof third-party cross-border\nexposures. The decline in\nexposure was partially offset\nby an increase of $1.0 billion\nin exposure in local currency\nterms, driven by $1.3 billion\nof dividends received by Citi\nas custodian for investor\nclients in Russia that Citi\nwas unable to remit due to\nregulatory restrictions,\npartially offset by payments\nto clients and tax\nauthorities. The decline in\noverall exposure was also\ndriven by a modest reduction\nin exposures to Russian\ncounterparties not held by AO\nCitibank.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued risk\nmitigation efforts have\nincluded ICG borrower paydowns\nand limiting extensions of new\ncredit. ICG \u2019s credit exposure\nalso reflected a shift to a\nhigher proportion of stronger\ncredit names, including a\nhigher proportion of\nsubsidiaries of multinational\ncompanies that are\nheadquartered outside of\nRussia, primarily in the U.S.\nand Europe.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $1.2\nbillion as of March 31, 2023\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2022). Citi hedges its\nruble/USD spot FX exposure in\nAOCI through the purchase of\nFX derivatives. The ongoing\nmark-to-market of the hedging\nderivatives is also reported\nin AOCI . When the ruble\ndepreciates against the USD,\nthe USD equivalent value of\nCitigroup\u2019s investment in AO\nCitibank also declines. This\nchange in value is offset by\nthe change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments and\nCorporate/Other have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.2 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct and\nindirect Russian\ncounterparties (compared to\n$0.3 billion at December 31,\n2022).\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi expects to\nincur approximately $210\nmillion in total estimated\ncharges ($60 million in ICG\nand $150 million in Legacy\nFranchises , excluding the\nimpact from any portfolio\nsales), largely driven by\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi\u2019s\nreferral agreement with a\nRussian bank for a portfolio\nof ruble-denominated credit\ncard loans, subject to\ncustomer consents, can be\nterminated under certain\ncircumstances and is being\nreevaluated as Citi reviews\nother alternatives. As a\nresult, the credit card loans\nwill remain held-for-\ninvestment and are not\ntransferred to held-for-sale.\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s continued efforts\nto reduce its operations and\nexposure in Russia, see Note 2\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s remaining operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\nappreciation or devaluation;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits business; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K).\nExamples of triggers that may\nresult in deconsolidation of\nAO Citibank include voluntary\nor forced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, Citi continued\nto consolidate AO Citibank\nbecause none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank Russia, Citi\u2019s\nforeign entity in Russia, Citi\nwould be required to (i) write\noff the net investment of\napproximately $1.2 billion\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2022), (ii) recognize a CTA\nloss of approximately $1.4\nbillion (compared to $1.3\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022) through earnings and\n(iii) recognize a loss of $0.4\nbillion (compared to $0.5\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.4 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g.,\n                               74                               \nDepository Trust Company,\nEuroclear, Clearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its current presence\nin Russia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and\n\nwill likely continue to\nattract, negative attention,\ndespite the previously\ndisclosed plan to wind down\nnearly all its activities in\nthe country, cessation of new\nbusiness and client\noriginations, and reduction of\nother exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of March 31, 2023,\nCiti had $1.2 billion of\ndirect exposures related to\nUkraine, compared to $1.0\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022. The increase in\nexposures reflected a $0.3\nbillion increase in deposits,\npartially offset by a $0.1\nbillion decrease in loans.\n                               75                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof March 31, 2023, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.8 billion. Under U.S. GAAP,\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar as\nthe functional currency for\nits operations in countries\nsuch as Argentina that are\ndeemed highly inflationary.\nCiti uses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net Argentine\npeso-denominated assets into\nthe U.S. dollar. As of March\n31, 2023, the official\nArgentine peso exchange rate\nagainst the U.S. dollar was\n208.995.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat generally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations. As a result,\nCiti\u2019s net investment in its\nArgentine operations is likely\nto continue to increase as\nCiti generates net income in\nits Argentine franchise and\nits earnings cannot be\nremitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. However, if\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate converges with the\napproximate rate implied by\nthe indirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms, Citi could incur a\nsignificant loss on its\ncapital in Argentina. Current\nmacroeconomic conditions in\nthe country, along with\nsustained high inflation and\nlow international reserves\nheld by the Central Bank of\nArgentina, may result in an\naccelerated or steep\ndepreciation of the official\nexchange rate in the near\nterm. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti may economically hedge\nthe foreign currency risk in\nits net Argentine peso-\ndenominated assets to the\nextent possible and prudent\nusing non-deliverable forward\n(NDF) derivative instruments\nthat are primarily executed\noutside of Argentina. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, the\ninternational NDF market had\nvery limited liquidity,\nresulting in Citi\u2019s inability\nto economically hedge\nsubstantially all of its\nArgentine peso exposure.\nAccordingly, and to the extent\nthat Citi does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate ACL on\nits Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of March\n31, 2023. However, U.S.\nregulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country or transfer\nrisk associated with its\nArgentine exposures.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentine exposures, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                               76                               \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES\n\nThis section contains a\nsummary of Citi\u2019s most\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated\n\nBalance Sheet with the changes\nin fair value recognized in\neither the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 21 and 22 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses on\nloans (ACLL) and total ACL as\nof the first quarter of 2023.\nFor information on the drivers\nof Citi\u2019s ACL build in the\nfirst quarter of 2023, see\n\u201c1Q23 Changes in the ACL\u201d\nbelow.

See Notes 1 and 14.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate loans is eight\nquarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks\n\nand current economic\nconditions not fully captured\nin the quantitative component.\nBoth the quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables,\nincluding housing prices,\nunemployment and real GDP, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\n                               78                               \nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect certain\nportfolio characteristics not\nfully captured in the\nquantitative component, such\nas idiosyncratic events and\nother factors as required by\nbanking supervisory guidance\nfor the ACL. These may include\nbut are not limited to: \u2022\nEmerging macroeconomic risks\ndue to uncertainties,\nincluding those related to\npotential global recession,\ninflation, interest rates,\ncommodity prices, geopolitical\ntensions and potential impacts\non vulnerable industries and\nregions \u2022 Normalization of\nportfolio performance and\nconsumer behavior from record\nlow losses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity Citi\u2019s qualitative\ncomponent declined quarter-\nover-quarter, primarily driven\nby releases of\nCOVID-19\u2013related uncertainty\nreserves as the portfolio\ncontinues to normalize toward\npre-pandemic levels and as\nthese risks are captured in\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Macroeconomic\nVariables Citi considers a\nmultitude of global\nmacroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Citi evaluates\nscenario weights on a quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the\nbase scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario reflects a more severe recession,\nincluding an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference\nbetween base and downside of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real\nGDP contraction in 2023 of 1.3%, with a peak quarter-over-\nquarter difference between base and downside of 1.0% in the\nsecond quarter of 2023. Citi\u2019s ACL is sensitive to the various\nmacroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of\nexpected credit losses due to changes in the length and severity\nof forecasted economic variables or events in the respective\nscenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside scenario as of March 31, 2023, to reflect\nthe most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios. Citi\u2019s downside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted\nscenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the\nACL of approximately $4.5 billion related to lending exposures,\nexcept for loans individually evaluated for credit losses. This\nanalysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the\nqualitative component of the ACL. These factors could decrease\nthe outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical\nexperience and current conditions at the time of the assessment.\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three\nprobability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined\nwith the qualitative component remains appropriate as of March\n31, 2023. 1Q23 Changes in the ACL As further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for the first quarter of 2023 was\n$19.8 billion, compared to $19.4 billion as of December 31,\n2022. The change of $0.4 billion was driven by an ACL build of\n$0.6 billion, partially offset by the adoption of ASU 2022-02\nrelated to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. The build\nwas primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic\noutlook (see \u201cMacroeconomic Variables\u201d above) and growth in card\nrevolving balances in PBWM , partially offset by reductions in\nRussia loan exposures (see \u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Russia\u201d above). Based on its latest macroeconomic\nforecast, Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the\n                               79                               \nforward view of the economic\nenvironment as of March 31,\n2023. See Note 14 for\nadditional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. Cards\nin U.S. Personal Banking.\nCiti\u2019s total consumer ACLL\nbuild was $0.5 billion in the\nfirst quarter of 2023,\nprimarily driven by a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions and growth in U.S.\nCards revolving balances. In\naddition, the ACLL decreased\n$352 million from the adoption\nof ASU 2022-02 for the\nrecognition and measurement of\nTDRs resulting in a March 31,\n2023 ACLL balance of $14.4\nbillion, or 3.96% of total\nfunded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. Cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans increased to\n8.08% at March 31, 2023,\ncompared to 7.56% at December\n31, 2022. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.21% at\nMarch 31, 2023, compared to\n1.26% at December 31, 2022.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of $0.1 billion in the\nfirst quarter of 2023. The\nrelease was primarily driven\nby reductions in Russia\nexposures. The ACLL reserve\nbalance decreased by $0.1\nbillion to $2.8 billion, or\n0.98% of total funded\ncorporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.2 billion in the first\nquarter of 2023, which reduced\nthe ACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $2.0 billion. The release\nwas primarily driven by\nreductions in Russia\nexposures.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost of $0.4 billion\nin the first quarter of 2023,\nwhich increased the ACL\nreserve balance included in\nOther assets to $0.6 billion.\nThe build was primarily driven\nby a reserve build related to\nan increase in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. See Note 14\nfor additional information.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt March 31, 2023, the ratio\nof the ACLL to total funded\nloans was 2.65% (3.96% for\nconsumer loans and 0.98% for\ncorporate loans), compared to\n2.60% at December 31, 2022\n(3.84% for consumer loans and\n1.01% for corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $2.6 billion at March 31,\n2023, up $169 million from\nDecember 31, 2022. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans of $1.4\nbillion at March 31, 2023\nincreased $78 million from\nDecember 31, 2022. Corporate\nnon-accrual loans increased\n$91 million to $1.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023, compared to\n$1.1 billion at December 31,\n2022. In addition, the ratio\nof non-accrual loans to total\nloans was 0.42% and 0.38% for\ncorporate and consumer loans,\nrespectively, at March 31,\n2023 (for additional\ninformation on non-accrual\nloans, see \u201cAdditional\nConsumer and Corporate Credit\nDetails\u2014Non-Accrual Loans and\nAssets and Renegotiated Loans\u201d\nabove).\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti elected the modified CECL\ntransition provision for\nregulatory capital purposes\nprovided by the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 final rule.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from the adoption of\nCECL, as well as the ongoing\nadjustments for 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021, started to\nbe phased in on January 1,\n2022 and will be fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 14 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of\nOctober 1 (the annual test)\nand conducts interim\nassessments between the annual\ntest if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that\nwould more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nAt October 1, 2022, the fair\nvalue of two reporting units\n(Banking and Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM) ranged from\n102% to 106% of their carrying\nvalues. The carrying values of\nthe Banking and Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM reporting units\nincluded approximately $1.5\nbillion and $1 billion of\ngoodwill, respectively. For\neach of the remaining\nreporting units, fair value\nexceeded carrying value by at\nleast 10%.\n\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

The\ndecrease was primarily a\nresult of gains in Other\ncomprehensive income . Of\nCiti\u2019s $27.6 billion of net\nDTAs, $16.4 billion was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder the Basel III rules. The\nremaining $11.2 billion\n(compared to $11.0 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022) was\ndeducted in calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. The $11.2\nbillion of DTA deducted from\nregulatory capital was\ncomposed of $11.8 billion\nrelated to tax carry-forwards\nand $1.1 billion of temporary\ndifferences in excess of the\n10%/15% regulatory\nlimitations, and was reduced\nby $1.7 billion of deferred\ntax liabilities, primarily\nassociated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible\nassets that were separately\ndeducted from capital. The\nlargest component of the\nincrease in the DTA deducted\nfrom Citi\u2019s regulatory capital\nduring the quarter was related\nto temporary differences in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations ($1.1 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023 compared to\n$0.3 billion at December 31,\n2022), primarily attributable\nto higher temporary\ndifferences in DTAs subject to\nthe limitation. DTA\nRealizability Citi believes\nthat realization of the net\nDTAs of $27.6 billion at March\n31, 2023 is more-likely-than-\nnot, based on management\u2019s\nexpectations of future taxable\nincome generation in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ).\n                               81                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nMarch 31, 2023. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure is generally\nrequired even where the\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings were conducted in\ncompliance with applicable\nlaw. Citi did not identify any\nreportable activities pursuant\nto Section 219 for the first\nquarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2023, Citigroup identified one\ntransaction pursuant to\nSection 219 related to the\nfourth quarter of 2022.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of March 31,\n2023 and for the three-month\nperiods ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022 include the accounts\nof Citigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded within Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2022. Certain financial\ninformation that is normally\nincluded in annual financial\nstatements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required\nfor interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nCash equivalents are defined\nas those amounts included in\nCash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits\nwith banks . Cash flows from\nrisk management activities are\nclassified in the same\ncategory as the related assets\nand liabilities. Amounts\nincluded in Cash and due from\nbanks and Deposits with banks\napproximate fair value.\n\nUPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES The accounting\npolicies below have been\nupdated from those disclosed\nin Citi\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K (2022 Form 10-K)\nas a result of accounting\nstandards adopted during the\nfirst quarter of 2023. See\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for a summary\nof all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Allowances for\nCredit Losses (ACL) Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi adopted\nAccounting Standards Update\n(ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures under the\nmethodology described below.\nFor information about Citi\u2019s\naccounting for troubled debt\nrestructurings (TDRs) prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, see Note 1 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. ASU 2022-02 eliminates\nthe accounting and disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs,\nincluding the requirement to\nmeasure the ACLL for TDRs\nusing a discounted cash flow\n(DCF) approach. With the\nelimination of TDR accounting\nrequirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer\nconsidered when determining\nthe term over which to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses. The ACLL for modified\nloans that are collateral\ndependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Consumer Loans\nUpon adoption of the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\ndiscontinued the use of a DCF\napproach for consumer loans\nformerly considered TDRs.\nBeginning January 1, 2023,\nCiti measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under\napproaches that do not\nincorporate discounting,\nprimarily utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default, loss\ngiven default and exposure at\ndefault. In addition, upon\nadoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates\nsmaller-balance homogenous\nloans formerly considered TDRs\nfor expected credit losses,\nwhereas previously those loans\nhad been individually\nevaluated.\n                               95                               \nACCOUNTING CHANGES TDRs and Vintage Disclosures In March 2022,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023. Citi\nadopted the guidance on the recognition and measurement of TDRs\nunder the modified retrospective approach. See the \u201cACL\u201d section\nunder the \u201cUpdated Significant Accounting Policies\u201d heading in\nthis Note above for a description of the ASU\u2019s amendments to the\nTDR recognition and measurement guidance. Adopting those\namendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of $ 352million\nand an increase in other assets related to held-for-sale\nbusinesses of $ 44million, with a corresponding increase to\nretained earnings of $ 290million and a decrease in deferred tax\nassets of $ 106million on January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate\nloans was unaffected because the measurement approach used for\ncorporate loans is not in the scope of this ASU. The ASU also\nrequires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves\nprincipal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-\nthan-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a\ncombination of those types of modifications. In addition, the\nASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs\nby year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to\ndisclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning\nas of the date of adoption. See Note 13 for these new\ndisclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.\nFair Value Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method In March 2022, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic\n815): Fair Value Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method , intended to\nbetter align hedge accounting with an organization\u2019s risk\nmanagement strategies. Specifically, the guidance expands the\ncurrent single-layer method to allow multiple hedge layers of a\nsingle closed portfolio of qualifying assets, which include both\nprepayable and non-prepayable assets. Coincident with the\nadoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred HTM\nmortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair value\nof approximately $ 3.3billion and $ 3.4billion, respectively,\ninto AFS as permitted under the guidance, and hedged them under\nthe portfolio layer method. At the time of transfer, the\nsecurities were in an unrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion,\nwhich was recorded in AOCI upon transfer. Long-Duration\nInsurance Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2018-12, Financial Services\u2014Insurance: Targeted Improvements to\nthe Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures\nfor long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits\nand prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for\nlong-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves\nthe accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii)\nsimplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and\n(iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily\nin Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as\ntraditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity\ncontracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12.\nThe effective date of ASU 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance\nentities by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate (issued in October 2019) and by ASU 2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued\nin November 2020). Citi adopted the targeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $ 39million decrease\nin Other liabilities and a $ 27million increase in AOCI , after-\ntax. Voluntary Change in Goodwill Impairment Assessment Date\nDuring 2022, the Company voluntarily changed its annual goodwill\nimpairment assessment date from July 1 to October 1. See Notes 1\nand 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2022\nForm 10-K for additional information. Multiple Macroeconomic\nScenarios-Based ACL Approach During the second quarter of 2022,\nCiti refined its ACL methodology to utilize multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios to estimate its allowance for credit\nlosses. The ACL was previously estimated using a combination of\na single base-case forecast scenario as part of its quantitative\ncomponent and a component of its qualitative management\nadjustment that reflects economic uncertainty from downside\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As a result of this change, Citi now\nexplicitly incorporates multiple macroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside, and downside\u2014and associated probabilities in the\nquantitative component when estimating its ACL, while still\nretaining certain of its qualitative management adjustments.\nThis refinement represents a \u201cchange in accounting estimate\u201d\nunder ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ,\nwith prospective application beginning in the period of change.\nThis change in accounting estimate resulted in a decrease of\napproximately $ 0.3billion in the allowance for credit losses in\nthe second quarter of 2022, partially offsetting an increase of\n$ 0.8billion in the allowance for credit losses due to the\nincreased macroeconomic uncertainty and other factors in the\nsecond quarter of 2022. FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures In March 2023, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint\nVentures (Topic 3232): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU\nexpands the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply\nthe proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible\ninvestment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits\nand other income tax benefits that are received by the investor,\n                               96                               \nwith the amortization of the\ninvestment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in\nthe income statement as\ncomponents of income tax\nexpense (benefit). Prior to\nthe issuance of this ASU, use\nof the proportional\namortization method was\nlimited to tax equity\ninvestments in Low\u2010Income\nHousing Tax Credit (LIHTC)\nstructures, and all other tax\nequity investments were\ntypically accounted for using\nthe equity method of\naccounting, which resulted in\ninvestment income, gains and\nlosses, and tax credits being\npresented gross on the income\nstatement in their respective\nline items. The ASU will\npermit the Company to elect to\nuse the proportional\namortization method to account\nfor all eligible tax equity\ninvestments, regardless of the\ntax credit program from which\nthe income tax credits are\nreceived, if certain\nconditions are met. For public\nentities, the ASU is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023,\nalthough early adoption is\npermitted in any interim\nperiod. However, if an entity\nadopts the amendments in an\ninterim period, it shall adopt\nthem as of the beginning of\nthe fiscal year that includes\nthat interim period. Adoption\nof the ASU must be applied on\neither a retrospective or a\nmodified retrospective basis.\nCiti plans to adopt the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2024 and is\ncurrently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on tax\nequity investments. Citi does\nnot expect a material impact\nto its results of operations\nas a result of adopting the\nstandard.\n\nFair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-3, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions.\n\nThe ASU is to be adopted on a\nprospective basis and will be\neffective for Citi on January\n1, 2024, although early\nadoption is permitted.\nAdoption of the accounting\nstandard is not expected to\nhave an impact on Citi\u2019s\noperating results or financial\nposition, as the Company\nexcludes such restrictions\nwhen valuing equity\nsecurities.\n                               97                               \n2.

Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and\nInstitutional Banking Businesses On August 25, 2022, Citi\nannounced its decision to wind down its consumer banking and\nlocal commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the\nwind-down, Citi is also actively pursuing sales of certain\nRussian consumer banking portfolios. On October 14, 2022, Citi\ndisclosed that it will be ending nearly all of the institutional\nbanking services it offers in Russia by the end of the first\nquarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi\u2019s only operations in Russia\nwill be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. On December 12, 2022, Citi completed the\nsale of a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment\nloans, totaling approximately $ 240million in outstanding loan\nbalances, to Uralsib, a Russian commercial bank, resulting in a\npretax net loss of approximately $ 12million. The net loss on\nsale of the loan portfolio included a $ 32million adjustment to\nrecord the loans at lower of cost or fair value recognized in\nOther revenue. In addition, the sale of the loans resulted in a\nrelease in the allowance for credit losses on loans of\napproximately $ 20million recognized in the Provision for credit\nlosses on loans . Citi\u2019s referral agreement with a Russian bank\nfor a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject\nto customer consents, can be terminated under certain\ncircumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other\nalternatives. As a result, the credit card loans will remain\nheld-for-investment and are not transferred to held-for-sale.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, Citi recorded a pretax charge\nof approximately $ 7million and $ 5million (approximately $\n30million and $ 10million program-to-date) as Compensation and\nbenefits composed of severance costs, reported in Legacy\nFranchises and Institutional Clients Group , respectively. Citi\nalso recorded a pretax charge of approximately $ 6million\n(approximately $ 13million program-to-date) as Other operating\nexpenses composed of vendor termination and other costs,\nreported in Legacy Franchises . In connection with this wind-\ndown, Citi expects to incur approximately $ 210million in total\nestimated charges ($ 60million in ICG and $ 150million in Legacy\nFranchises , excluding the impact from any portfolio sales),\nlargely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and\nother related charges.\n                              100                               \n                                                                \n  3.

consumer credit card programs have certain partner\nsharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310.

nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(3) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                              107

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 14 for further\ninformation.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 21 and 22. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 22. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost.\n\nThe election to measure a non-\nmarketable equity security\nusing the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.

During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company reversed accrued interest of\napproximately $ 0.6billion, primarily related to credit card\nloans.\n                              133                               \nInterest Income Recognized for Non-Accrual Consumer Loans\n                                                                \n                            Three Months          Three Months  \n  In millions of                   Ended                 Ended  \n  dollars                 March 31, 2023        March 31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In North                                                      \n  America                                                       \n  offices(1)                                                    \n  Residential        $                 3    $                3  \n  first mortgages                                               \n  Home equity                          2                     1  \n  loans                                                         \n  Credit cards                         \u2014                     \u2014  \n  Personal, small                                               \n  business and                         \u2014                     \u2014  \n  other                                                         \n  Total              $                 5    $                4  \n  In offices                                                    \n  outside North                                                 \n  America(1)                                                    \n  Residential        $                 1    $                \u2014  \n  mortgages                                                     \n  Credit cards                         \u2014                     \u2014  \n  Personal, small                                               \n  business and                         \u2014                     \u2014  \n  other                                                         \n  Total              $                 1    $                \u2014  \n  Total Citigroup    $                 6    $                4  \n                                                                \n(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.\nMexico is included in offices outside North America.\n\nThe Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $\n1.8billion and $ 7million of consumer loans during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. Residential Mortgages Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. In the U.S., before\npermanently modifying a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial\nmodification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three-monthperiod during which the borrower makes\nmonthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms.\nUpon successful completion of the trial period, Citi and the\nborrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects most\nloans entering trial modifications to ultimately be granted\npermanent modifications. At March 31, 2023, $ 25million of\nmortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. At March 31,\n2023, mortgage loans of $ 1million had gone through Chapter 7\nbankruptcy during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n                              140                               \nTypes of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect\nThe following table provides details on permanent consumer loan\nmodifications granted during the three months ended March 31,\n2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of\nmodification granted and the financial effect of those\nmodifications:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as\nof the end of the reporting period.

loans formerly\nconsidered TDRs.\n\n1Q23 Changes in the ACL The total allowance for credit losses on\nloans, leases and unfunded lending commitments as of March 31,\n2023 was $ 19,128million, a slight increase from $ 19,125million\nat December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACLL was primarily\ndriven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth in card\nrevolving balances, partially offset by a decrease in the ACLL\nof $ 352million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the\nrecognition and measurement of TDRs (see Note 1) and a decrease\nin the ACLUC primarily driven by reductions in Russia exposures.\nConsumer ACLL Citi\u2019s total consumer allowance for credit losses\non loans (ACLL) as of March 31, 2023 was $ 14,389million, an\nincrease from $ 14,119million at December 31, 2022. The increase\nwas primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions and growth in U.S. Cards revolving balances,\npartially offset by a decrease to the ACLL of $ 352million from\nthe adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement\nof TDRs. Corporate ACLL Citi\u2019s total corporate ACLL as of March\n31, 2023 was $ 2,780million, a decrease from $ 2,855million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by\nreductions in Russia exposures. ACLUC As of March 31, 2023,\nCiti\u2019s total ACLUC, included in Other liabilities , was $\n1,959million, a decrease from $ 2,151million at December 31,\n2022.

and December 31, 2022\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 10billion and $\n69billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 252million and $\n498million in maximum exposure to loss as of March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n                              154                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these\ntransactions was $ 25.2billion and $ 33.6billion, respectively\n(for more information on these positions, see Note 13 and Note\n27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n21 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              155                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the\ntable below include those assets that can only be used to settle\nobligations of consolidated VIEs, presented on the following\npage, and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the\nassets in the table below include third-party assets of\nconsolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities in the table below\ninclude third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and\nexclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\nThe liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or\nbeneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit\nof Citigroup.\n                                                                \n  In millions of dollars

In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets . The Company receives\nfees during the course of\nservicing previously\nsecuritized mortgages.

Re-securitizations The\nCompany engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private\nlabel) securities to re-securitization entities during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. These securities are\nbacked by either residential or commercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of clients. As of March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, Citi held noretained interests in private\nlabel re-securitization transactions structured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed (agency) securities.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, Citi transferred\nagency securities with a fair value of approximately $\n5.3billion to re-securitization entities, compared to\napproximately $ 9.3billion for the three months ended March 31,\n2022. As of March 31, 2023, the fair value of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by\nCiti totaled approximately $ 1.4billion (including $ 268million\nrelated to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023),\ncompared to $ 1.4billion as of December 31, 2022 (including $\n801million related to re-securitization transactions executed in\n2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained interest as of March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 were approximately $ 86.6billion and $\n79.4billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Company did not consolidate any private label or\nagency re-securitization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Conduits At March 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 19.4billion and $ 19.6billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of approximately $ 14.2billion and $\n13.9billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of\nthe conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted average\nremaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits\nwere approximately 63and 64days, respectively. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement features provided by the third-party client\nseller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread\ncollateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees.\nThese credit enhancements are sized with the objective of\napproximating a credit rating of A or\n                              159                               \nabove, based on Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. In addition to the\ntransaction-specific credit enhancements, the conduits, other\nthan the government-guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained\nletters of credit from the Company, which equal at least 8% to\n10% of the conduit\u2019s assets with a minimum of $ 350million. The\nletters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 1.9billion and $ 1.9billion as of March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. The net result across\nmultiseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the\nevent that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCompany owned $ 8.5billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively, of\nthe commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and\nthe Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits. Municipal Securities\nTender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At March 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB\ntrusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the\nCompany. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, liquidity\nagreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled\n$ 0.9billion and $ 1.1billion, respectively, of which $\n0.6billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively, were offset by\nreimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to\nTOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was\nat least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e.,\nmarket risk), counterparty\nfailure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress\n(i.e., liquidity risk), as\nwell as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              161                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of March\n31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              162

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nChanges in the fair value of\nthe forward points (i.e., the\nspot-forward difference) of\nforward contracts are excluded\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and are\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in the fair value of\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the\ncarrying value of the hedged\ninventory is reflected in\nearnings, which offsets the\nchange in the fair value of\nthe futures contract that is\nalso reflected in earnings.\nAlthough the entire change in\nthe fair value of the hedging\ninstrument is recorded in\nearnings, under certain hedge\nprograms, Citigroup excludes\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe forward points (i.e.,\nspot-forward difference) of\nthe futures contract from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and they are\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Under other hedge\nprograms, Citi excludes\nchanges in the fair value of\nforward points from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records them\nin Other comprehensive income.\n

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of March 31, 2023 is\napproximately $( 1.4) billion. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 13years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below.

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nwas $ 14billion and $\n18billion, respectively. The\nCompany posted $ 12billion and\n$ 15billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of March\n31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of March 31, 2023, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n0.6billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 22million upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n0.6billion and $ 1.4billion as\nof March 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, respectively. At\nMarch 31, 2023, the fair value\nof these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n0.6billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nMarch 31, 2023 was $ 14million\nrecorded as gross derivative\nassets and $ 2million recorded\nas gross derivative\nliabilities. At December 31,\n2022, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 1.4billion, and the fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps was $ 27million recorded\nas gross derivative assets and\n$ 32million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              170                               \n21. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022\nLevel 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven selection\ncriteria to determine whether\nan instrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based upon the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the\ncredit valuation

The gains and losses\npresented below include changes in the fair value related to\nboth observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often\nhedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified\nin a different level.

In other instances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some\nunobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall\nvaluation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money).

See Notes 18 and 21.\n                              186                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 18\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $( 433) million and gain of $ 1,050million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in\nfair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit\nrisk were estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current\ncredit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest revenue and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                   March                       31,              \n                31, 2023                      2022              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     5,364    $  5,134    $    6,011    $  5,360  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             260         125           167          51  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014           2             \u2014           2  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           1             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              187                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 641million and $\n729million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Changes\nin the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a\ngain of $ 9million and a loss of $( 59) million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to\neconomically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured\nliabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a\ndebt host contract and a commodity forward derivative\ninstrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt\nhost contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading\naccount assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\ntotal carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated\nprecious metals accounts was approximately $ 0.3billion and $\n0.3billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on\ntrading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of March\n31, 2023, there were approximately $ 25.1billion and $\n17.2billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nChanges in the fair values of these investments are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement\nof Income. Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate\nVentures Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate\nventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for\ncapital appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value\noption for certain of these ventures, because such investments\nare considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of             March 31,                          \n  dollars                         2023       December 31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the         $        901    $                793  \n  Consolidated Balance                                          \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggregate fair value                                          \n  in excess of (less                 6                     -10  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans or                                          \n  loans                              1                       1  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance in                                          \n  excess of fair value                                          \n  for non-accrual                    \u2014                       \u2014  \n  loans or loans more                                           \n  than 90 days past                                             \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              188                               \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. There was no net change in fair value\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes\nin the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in\naddition to instrument-specific credit spread.

For\ncertain contracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n122billion and $ 130billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n                              190                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 10million and $ 10million at March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of\nits credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nactual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of\nCiti\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\nIndemnification Citi has an indemnification contingency to\nBrighthouse Financial in connection with Citi\u2019s sale of an\ninsurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification\nagreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial\nwould become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when\nboth the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust\nassets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However,\nshould events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and\ntrust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse\nFinancial\u2019s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to\neither estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range\nof loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to\naccrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and\nestimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential\nexposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-the-\nCounter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on\ncentral clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 20 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\n                              191                               \nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 19.2billion and $ 18.0billion as of March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Variation margin due\nfrom clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.3billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 52.6billion and $\n51.8billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 71.9billion and $ 63.7billion at March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 3.2billion and $\n3.7billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to\ncover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications;\nhowever, the value of such property has not been determined.\n                              192                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

For purposes\nof this Note, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. With\nrespect to previously incurred\nloss contingencies for which\nrecovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and\nuncertainties affecting\nrecognition are resolved. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At March 31,\n2023, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.2billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 29 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. FDIC Special Assessment\nOn April 18, 2023, the FDIC\nannounced that in May 2023, it\nwill propose a special\nassessment to recover the\nuninsured deposit losses from\nthe failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. On\nMay 1, 2023, the FDIC\nannounced that its Deposit\nInsurance Fund will incur\nadditional costs related to\nthe resolution of First\nRepublic Bank. Citibank, N.A.\ncould incur an increase in its\nnon-interest expense from the\nimposition of additional\nassessments by the FDIC.\nHowever, neither the amount\nnor the timing of any\nadditional costs can be\nreasonably estimated.

The notes typically\ncontain embedded (but not\nseparable or detachable)\nderivatives. Contractual cash\nflows for principal, interest\nor both can vary in amount and\ntiming throughout the life of\nthe note based on non-\ntraditional indexes or non-\ntraditional uses of\ntraditional interest rates or\nindexes.\n\nTangible book value per share\n(TBVPS)*: Represents tangible\ncommon equity divided by EOP\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nTangible common equity (TCE):\nRepresents common\nstockholders\u2019 equity less\ngoodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets, other than\nMSRs.\n\nTaxable equivalent basis:\nRepresents the total revenue,\nnet of interest expense for\nthe business, adjusted for\nrevenue from investments that\nreceive tax credits and the\nimpact of tax-exempt\nsecurities. This metric\npresents results on a level\ncomparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities.\nGAAP measures on taxable\nequivalent basis, including\nthe metrics derived from these\nmeasures, are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\n\nTDR: Troubled debt\nrestructuring. Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, a TDR was\ndeemed to occur when the\nCompany modified the original\nterms of a loan agreement by\ngranting a concession to a\nborrower that was experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. Loans\nwith short-term and other\ninsignificant modifications\nthat are not considered\nconcessions were not TDRs. The\naccounting guidance for TDRs\nwas eliminated with the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02. See\nNote 1 for more information.\n\nTLAC: Total loss-absorbing\ncapacity\n\nTotal ACL: Allowance for\ncredit losses, which comprises\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL),\nallowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC), allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM securities and\nallowance for credit losses on\nother assets.\n\nTotal payout ratio*:\nRepresents total common\ndividends declared plus common\nshare repurchases as a\npercentage of net income\navailable to common\nshareholders.\n\nTransformation: Citi has\nembarked on a multiyear\ntransformation, with the\ntarget outcome to change\nCiti\u2019s business and operating\nmodels such that they\nsimultaneously strengthen risk\nand controls and improve\nCiti\u2019s value to customers,\nclients and shareholders.\n\nUnaudited: Financial\nstatements and information\nthat have not been subjected\nto auditing procedures\nsufficient to permit an\nindependent certified public\naccountant to express an\nopinion.\n\nU.S. government agencies: U.S.\ngovernment agencies include,\nbut are not limited to,\nagencies such as Ginnie Mae\nand FHA, and do not include\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nwhich are U.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises (U.S.\nGSEs).
