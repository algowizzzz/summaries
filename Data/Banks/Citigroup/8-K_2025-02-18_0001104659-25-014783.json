Current Report on Form 8-K Item 8.01. Other\nEvents. On February 13, 2025 (the Grant Date), the Compensation,\nPerformance Management and Culture Committee of the Citigroup\nInc. (Citi) Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee)\napproved incentive compensation awards for 2024 performance to\nCiti\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Jane Fraser. The\nCompensation Committee\u2019s 2024 incentive compensation\ndetermination reflects its belief that Ms. Fraser\u2019s strategic\nand other priorities are sound and that she is executing on them\npromptly and thoughtfully, with an eye towards enhanced safety\nand soundness, improved returns and laying the foundation for\nlong-term sustainable growth. These priorities include executing\non Citi\u2019s risk and control transformation; aligning Citi\u2019s\norganizational structure to its business strategy and increasing\naccountability, transparency and focus of execution for Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses; and exiting or winding down Citi\u2019s remaining\ninternational consumer markets to simplify the business. Citi\u2019s\ncompensation process starts with goal setting at the beginning\nof the year in which the Compensation Committee approves\nscorecards for Ms. Fraser and Citi\u2019s other executive officers.\nThe scorecards include both individual and corporate metrics and\ndrive performance assessments across Financial, Risk and\nControl, Client and Franchise, and Leadership performance\npillars. Year-end performance assessments occur in conjunction\nwith market benchmarking versus peers, which lead to the\nCompensation Committee determinations on total incentive values.\nThe following factors were elements of the Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s 2024 compensation determination for Ms. Fraser:\n                                     \n  \u25cf  As Citi\u2019s CEO, Ms. Fraser has:  \n
