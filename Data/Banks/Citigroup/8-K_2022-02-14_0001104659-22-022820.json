Current Report on Form 8-K Item 8.01. Other\nEvents. On February 10, 2022 (the Grant Date), the Personnel and\nCompensation Committee of the Citigroup Inc. (Citi) Board of\nDirectors (the Compensation Committee) approved incentive\ncompensation awards for 2021 performance to Citi\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO) Jane Fraser. In setting Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nincentive compensation for 2021, the Compensation Committee\nconsidered the following:\n                                                                \n     Ms. Fraser\u2019s tenure as CEO commenced on February 26,       \n     2021.  She has quickly worked to establish a clear set of  \n     priorities for Citi that are intended to increase          \n     shareholder value over time.  These priorities are         \n     centered around Citi\u2019s Transformation, Strategic Refresh,  \n     and Culture and Talent.  Execution of this strategy is     \n     expected to generate excess capital, which Citi can then   \n  \u25cf  return to shareholders.                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     In April, Citi announced that it would exit 13 consumer    \n     markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East and focus on   \n  \u25cf  wealth management and its institutional business in those  \n     regions.  Similarly, Citi recently announced its           \n     intention to focus its franchise in Mexico on its          \n     Institutional and Private Bank clients                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Consistent with those strategic actions, Citi is creating  \n     a new Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)        \n  \u25cf  operating segment.  This is intended to align Citi\u2019s       \n     organization and financial reporting with its refreshed    \n     strategy and to enable investors and others to better      \n     understand the performance of Citi\u2019s businesses.           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     In parallel with the strategic actions noted above, Citi   \n     has been focused on meeting the expectations of its        \n     regulators to address the Consent Orders entered into      \n  \u25cf  with the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the       \n     Comptroller of the Currency in October 2020.  Citi\u2019s       \n     plans to address the Consent Orders were submitted to      \n     both regulators in the third quarter of 2021, and Citi     \n     has been refining and executing on those plans.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Ms. Fraser has also put a renewed emphasis on Citi\u2019s       \n     Environmental, Social and Governance practices.  Most      \n  \u25cf  notably, she fulfilled a pledge she made on her first day  \n     as CEO of presenting an initial plan to achieve net zero   \n     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.                    \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s 2021 financial performance highlights included:\n                                                              \n  \u25cf  Full year revenues of $71.9 billion, down 5% from 2020.  \n                                                              \n                                                                \n     Net income for the full year of $22.0 billion, primarily   \n  \u25cf  reflecting an allowance for credit loss (ACL) release      \n     driven by continued improvement in both the macroeconomic  \n     environment and portfolio credit quality.                  \n                                                                \n                                              \n  \u25cf  Full year earnings per share of $10.14.  \n                                              \n                                                                \n     The return of nearly $12 billion in capital to Citi\u2019s      \n     common shareholders, and growth of its book value per      \n  \u25cf  share by 7% to $92.21.  Citi ended the year with a Common  \n     Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) ratio of 12.3%, based on the  \n     Basel III Standardized Approach framework.                 \n                                                                \nUnderpinning the foregoing specific priorities, Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nindividual performance in respect of four performance pillars \u2013\nFinancial, Leadership, Client and Franchise, and Risk and\nControls \u2013 her focus on establishing a culture of enhanced\naccountability and excellence across Citi, and competitive\nmarket levels of pay were considered by the Compensation\nCommittee. The Compensation Committee also increased the portion\nof Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive compensation that will be paid in\nPerformance Share Units in 2021 from 35% to 50%.\n\n2\n\nThe Compensation Committee determined that Ms. Fraser\u2019s\ncompensation for 2021 is $22.5 million, consisting of a base\nsalary of $1.333 million and a total incentive award of $21.167\nmillion. The base salary reflects amounts received at the\nannualized rate of $1.5 million for the 10 months of the year\nduring which she was CEO.
