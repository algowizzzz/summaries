In connection\ntherewith, during the second\nquarter of 2024, Citi\ntransferred the retail banking\nbusiness in the United Kingdom\n(U.K.), which is being wound\ndown, from Wealth to Legacy\nFranchises (managed basis)\nwithin All Other (managed\nbasis).\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of material risks\nand uncertainties that could\nimpact Citigroup\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Citi prepares its financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or\notherwise include components that differ from the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCiti believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures\nprovides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals\nof period-to-period operating results for investors, industry\nanalysts and others, including increased transparency and\nclarity into Citi\u2019s results, and improved visibility into\nmanagement decisions and their impacts on operational\nperformance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and\nallows Citi to provide a long-term strategic view of its\nbusinesses and results going forward. These non-GAAP measures\nare not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and\nmay not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP\nmeasures with similar names used by other companies.

Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$33 million, revenues\nincreased 3%, driven by growth\nacross all reportable\noperating segments, including\nan approximate $400 million\nepisodic gain related to the\nVisa B exchange completed in\nthe current quarter. A\nsignificant portion of this\ngain was reflected in Markets\n, with the remainder in All\nOther (managed basis). The\nrevenue growth across the\nreportable operating segments\nwas partially offset by a\ndecline in All Other (managed\nbasis).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses decreased 2%\nversus the prior-year period.\nExcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts in both the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod, expenses also\ndecreased 2%. The decrease was\ndriven by savings associated\nwith Citi\u2019s organizational\nsimplification, stranded cost\nreductions and lower\nrepositioning costs, partially\noffset by continued investment\nin Citi\u2019s transformation and\nthe accrual for the civil\nmoney penalties imposed by the\nBoard of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (FRB)\nand the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) (Civil Money Penalties).\n(See \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\napproximately $2.5 billion\nversus $1.8 billion in the\nprior-year period. The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby higher cards net credit\nlosses in Branded Cards and\nRetail Services in U.S.\nPersonal Banking ( USPB ),\npartially offset by allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL)\nreleases in all businesses\nexcept USPB and All Other .\nThe higher cards net credit\nlosses primarily reflected the\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years, including those\nwith delayed losses due to\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nincrease was due to\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the continued\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios, with lower FICO\nband customers primarily\ndriving the increase.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $1.0 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends.\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio\nunder the Basel III\nStandardized Approach\nincreased to 13.6% as of June\n30, 2024, compared to 13.4% as\nof June 30, 2023 (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below). This\ncompares to Citigroup\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio of 12.3% under\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach. On October 1, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nis expected to decrease to\n12.1% from 12.3%\n\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, reflecting the\ndecrease in the indicative\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB)\nrequirement to 4.1% from 4.3%\n(see \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nCapital Buffer\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 As previously disclosed, on\nJuly 10, 2024, the FRB entered\ninto a Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Order with Citigroup\nin the amount of approximately\n$61 million, and the OCC\nentered into a Civil Money\nPenalty Consent Order with\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank), a\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup, in the amount of\n$75 million (collectively, the\n2024 Consent Orders). The OCC\nand Citibank also entered into\nan Amendment (the Amendment)\nto the October 7, 2020 OCC\nConsent Order. The Amendment\nrequires Citibank to submit a\nResource Review Plan to the\nOCC within 30 days and\nestablishes certain provisions\ngoverning payment of\nintercompany dividends from\nCitibank ultimately to\nCitigroup. Copies of the 2024\nConsent Orders and the\nAmendment were included as\nexhibits to Citi\u2019s Current\nReport on Form 8-K filed with\nthe SEC on July 10, 2024 (the\nJuly 10, 2024 Form 8-K). For\nadditional information\nregarding the 2024 Consent\nOrders and the Amendment, see\nthe July 10, 2024 Form 8-K and\n\u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d below.\n\n\u2022 In July 2024, Citi completed\nthe sale and migration of its\nChina consumer portfolios,\nfinalizing Citi\u2019s previously\nannounced exit of its consumer\nbanking business in China.\nCiti also continued to make\nprogress with the wind-downs\nof the Korea consumer banking\nbusiness and the Russia\nconsumer, local commercial and\ninstitutional businesses, as\nwell as the separation of\nCiti\u2019s consumer banking and\nsmall business and middle-\nmarket banking operations in\nMexico in preparation for a\nplanned initial public\noffering.\n                                                                \n  Second Quarter of 2024 Results Summary                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $3.2 billion, or $1.52 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. Net income increased\n10% versus the prior-year\nperiod, as the higher revenues\nand the lower expenses more\nthan offset the higher cost of\ncredit. Citigroup\u2019s effective\ntax rate in the current\nquarter was approximately 24%,\ncompared to 27% in the prior-\nyear period, reflecting the\nimpact of the geographic mix\nof earnings and the effects of\nstate tax law changes in the\ncurrent quarter. Average\ndiluted shares outstanding\ndecreased 1%.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $20.1\nbillion increased 4% versus\nthe prior-year period, on a\nreported basis. Excluding the\ndivestiture-related impacts in\nboth periods, revenues of\n$20.1 billion increased 3%,\ndriven by growth across all\nreportable operating segments,\nincluding the approximate $400\nmillion episodic gain related\nto the Visa B exchange\ncompleted in the current\nquarter. The revenue growth\nacross the reportable\noperating segments was\npartially offset by a decline\nin All\n                               4                                \nOther (managed basis).

(As used\nthroughout this Form 10-Q,\nCiti\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nServices revenues were driven\nby higher revenues in\nSecurities Services as well as\nthe impact of continued\nunderlying momentum in\nTreasury and Trade Solutions\n(TTS), partially offset by\nlower revenue from the net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nMarkets revenues were driven\nby strength in Equity Markets,\nwhich included the episodic\ngain related to the Visa B\nexchange completed in the\ncurrent quarter, while Banking\nrevenues largely reflected\ngrowth in Investment Banking.\nUSPB revenues benefited from\nloan growth in cards, as well\nas lower partner payments, and\nWealth revenues were primarily\ndriven by higher investment\nfee revenue.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $688 billion, up 4%\nversus the prior-year period,\nlargely reflecting loan growth\nin cards in USPB and higher\nloans in Markets and Services\n.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, down 3% versus\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndue to a decline in TTS in\nServices , primarily\nreflecting quantitative\ntightening.

The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher net\ncredit losses in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services in USPB ,\npartially offset by ACL\nreleases in all businesses\nexcept USPB and All Other .\nThe higher cards net credit\nlosses primarily reflected\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years, including those\nwith delayed losses due to\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nincrease was due to\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the continued\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios, with lower FICO\nband customers primarily\ndriving the increase.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $2.3\nbillion increased 52% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $2.2\nbillion increased 52%, largely\nreflecting the rise in cards\nnet credit loss rates.\nCorporate net credit losses\nincreased to $108 million from\n$75 million.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.6% as of June 30, 2024,\ncompared to 13.4% as of June\n30, 2023, based on the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets (RWA). The increase was\nprimarily driven by the net\nincome, a decrease in RWA,\ninterest rate impacts on\nCitigroup\u2019s investment\nportfolio and impacts from the\nsales of certain Asia consumer\nbanking (Asia Consumer)\nbusinesses, partially offset\nby the payment of common and\npreferred dividends, and share\nrepurchases, as well as higher\ndisallowed deferred tax\nassets.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024,\nCiti paid $1.0 billion of\ncommon dividends (see\n\u201cUnregistered Sales of Equity\nSecurities, Repurchases of\nEquity Securities and\nDividends\u201d below). As\npreviously announced, Citi\ncurrently expects to\nrepurchase approximately $1.0\nbillion of common shares\nduring the third quarter of\n2024. In future periods, Citi\nwill continue to assess common\nshare repurchases on a\nquarter-by-quarter basis given\nuncertainty regarding\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.

Cost of credit was\na benefit of $27 million,\ncompared to a cost of $223\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The current-quarter\nACL release was primarily due\nto an improved macroeconomic\noutlook.\n\nServices revenues of $4.7\nbillion increased 3%,\nprimarily reflecting higher\nrevenues in Securities\nServices, as well as the\nimpact of continued underlying\nmomentum in TTS. The increase\nin revenues was partially\noffset by lower net interest\nincome from the net investment\nin Argentina. Net interest\nincome decreased 1%, largely\ndriven by lower revenue from\n                               5                                \nthe net investment in\nArgentina, partially offset by\nthe benefit of higher U.S. and\nnon-U.S. interest rates. Non-\ninterest revenue increased\n11%, on continued strength\nacross underlying fee drivers,\nas well as a smaller impact\nfrom currency devaluation in\nArgentina.\n\nTTS revenues of $3.4 billion\nwere largely unchanged versus\nthe prior-year period. TTS\nnon-interest revenue increased\n14%, primarily driven by\ncontinued growth in underlying\ndrivers, including increases\nin cross-border transaction\nvalue, U.S. dollar clearing\nvolumes and commercial card\nspend volume. The increase in\nnon-interest revenue was\noffset by a 3% decline in net\ninterest income, driven by\nlower revenue from the net\ninvestment in Argentina,\npartially offset by the\nbenefit of higher U.S. and\nnon-U.S. interest rates\nrelative to the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $1.2 billion increased 10%,\nlargely driven by a 14%\nincrease in net interest\nincome, primarily driven by\nhigher deposit spreads, and a\n7% increase in non-interest\nrevenue. The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was primarily\ndriven by fee growth due to\nhigher assets under custody\nand administration (AUC/AUA)\nbalances, which benefited from\nnew client onboarding,\ndeepening relationships with\nexisting clients and higher\nmarket valuations.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s exposure in\nArgentina, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other Risk\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Argentina\u201d below.

Markets expenses of\n$3.3 billion decreased 1%,\ndriven by productivity\nsavings, partially offset by\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses. Cost of credit was a\nbenefit of $11 million versus\na benefit of $17 million in\nthe prior-year period. The\ncurrent-quarter ACL release\nwas primarily driven by\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition combined with an\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook, which was partially\noffset by higher net credit\nlosses.\n\nMarkets revenues of $5.1\nbillion increased 6%, driven\nby growth in Equity Markets,\nup 37%, partially offset by a\n3% decline in Fixed Income\nMarkets. The decline in Fixed\nIncome Markets was largely\ndriven by rates and\ncurrencies, down 11%, on lower\nvolatility and tighter\nspreads, partially offset by\nstrength in spread products\nand other fixed income,\nprimarily driven by continued\nloan growth and higher\nsecuritization and\nunderwriting fees. Equity\nMarkets benefited from growth\nacross equity derivatives,\nwhich included the episodic\ngain related to the Visa B\nexchange completed in the\ncurrent quarter. Momentum\ncontinued in prime balances.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nMarkets in the second quarter\nof 2024, see \u201c Markets \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Banking                                                       \n                                                                \nBanking net income was $406\nmillion, compared to net\nincome of $50 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nhigher revenues and lower\nexpenses, partially offset by\na lower benefit from cost of\ncredit. Banking expenses of\n$1.1 billion decreased 10%,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nfrom repositioning actions and\nother actions to lower the\nexpense base. Cost of credit\nwas a benefit of $32 million,\nversus a benefit of $148\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL release in\nthe current quarter was\nprimarily driven by an\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.6\nbillion increased 38%, driven\nby growth in Investment\nBanking and Corporate Lending,\nas well as a gain on loan\nhedges ($9 million gain versus\n$66 million loss in the prior-\nyear period). Investment\nBanking revenues increased\n60%, driven by the Debt\nCapital Markets (DCM) and\nEquity Capital Markets (ECM)\nbusinesses as well as\nAdvisory, each reflecting an\nincreased wallet and wallet\nshare gains. Corporate Lending\nrevenues increased 20%,\nincluding the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges.\nExcluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, Corporate Lending\nrevenues increased 7%, largely\ndriven by higher revenue\nshare.

Cost of credit\nincreased to $2.3 billion,\ncompared to $1.5 billion in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby higher net credit losses\nand a higher net ACL build for\nloans. Net credit losses\nincreased 59%, primarily\nreflecting the maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years,\nincluding those with delayed\nlosses due to unprecedented\nlevels of government stimulus\nduring the pandemic. In\naddition, the increase was due\nto macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the continued\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios, with lower FICO\nband customers primarily\ndriving the increase. The ACL\nbuild of $382 million\nreflected cards loan growth.\n\nUSPB revenues of $4.9 billion\nincreased 6%, driven by a 5%\nincrease in net interest\nincome due to loan growth in\ncards, and higher non-interest\nrevenue due to lower partner\npayments. Branded Cards\nrevenues of $2.5 billion\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby interest-earning balance\ngrowth of 9%, as payment rates\ncontinued to moderate, and\ncard spend volume growth.\nRetail Services revenues of\n$1.7 billion increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by the lower\npartner payments due to higher\nnet credit losses, as well as\nhigher net interest income on\nhigher interest-earning loan\nbalances. Retail Banking\nrevenues of $636 million\nincreased 3%, driven by higher\ndeposit spreads, as well as\nmortgage and installment\n                               6                                \nloan growth, partially offset\nby the impact of the transfers\nof certain relationships and\nthe associated deposits to\nWealth .\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nUSPB in the second quarter of\n2024, see \u201c U.S. Personal\nBanking \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Wealth                                                        \n                                                                \nWealth net income was $210\nmillion, versus $84 million in\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting higher revenues,\nlower expenses and lower cost\nof credit. Wealth expenses\ndecreased 4% to $1.5 billion,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nfrom prior repositioning and\nrestructuring actions. Cost of\ncredit was a benefit of $9\nmillion, compared to a cost of\n$53 million in the prior-year\nperiod, as an ACL release\nreflecting an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook was\npartially offset by higher net\ncredit losses.\n\nWealth revenues of $1.8\nbillion increased 2%, driven\nby a 13% increase in non-\ninterest revenue, primarily\ndue to higher investment fee\nrevenues, partially offset by\na 4% decrease in net interest\nincome, largely due to higher\nmortgage funding costs.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nWealth in the second quarter\nof 2024, see \u201c Wealth \u201d below.\n\nAll Other (Managed Basis)\n\nAll Other (managed basis) net\nloss was $402 million,\ncompared to net income of $78\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by lower\nrevenues, higher cost of\ncredit and higher income tax\nexpense, partially offset by\nlower expenses. All Other\n(managed basis) expenses of\n$2.1 billion decreased 7%,\nprimarily driven by lower\nexpenses from the closed exits\nand wind-downs, partially\noffset by the Civil Money\nPenalties imposed by the FRB\nand the OCC. Cost of credit of\n$243 million increased 22%,\nlargely driven by an ACL build\nfor other assets and higher\nnet credit losses in the\ncurrent quarter, compared to a\nrelease for other assets in\nthe prior-year period. The\nincrease in cost of credit was\npartially offset by the\nabsence of an ACL build for\nloans in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nAll Other (managed basis)\nrevenues decreased 22% from\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by the closed\nexits and wind-downs and\nhigher funding costs,\npartially offset by growth in\nMexico as well as the benefit\nfrom the Visa B exchange.\n\nLegacy Franchises (managed\nbasis) revenues were $1.7\nbillion, a decline of 10% from\nthe prior-year period, due to\nlower revenues in Asia\nConsumer (managed basis),\nreflecting the closed exits\nand wind-downs, and Legacy\nHoldings Assets, driven by\nhigher funding costs. The\ndecrease was partially offset\nby higher revenues across\ncards, SBMM and retail banking\nin Mexico Consumer/SBMM\n(managed basis).\n\nCorporate/Other revenues\ndecreased to $253 million,\ncompared to $609 million in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby higher funding costs,\npartially offset by the\nbenefit from the Visa B\nexchange.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nAll Other (managed basis) in\nthe second quarter of 2024,\nsee \u201c All Other \u2014Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling\nItems)\u201d and \u201c All Other\n(Managed Basis)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and regulatory\nchallenges and uncertainties\ncontinue to impact economic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally, including, among\nothers, central bank interest\nrates policies, continued\nelevated inflation, and\neconomic and geopolitical\nchallenges related to the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war, conflicts\nin the Middle East, and China.\nThese and other factors have\nnegatively impacted global\neconomic growth rates and\nconsumer sentiment and could\nresult in a recession in\nvarious regions and countries\nglobally.

As discussed in the\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above, on\nJuly 10, 2024, the FRB entered\ninto a Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Order with Citigroup,\nand the OCC entered into a\nCivil Money Penalty Consent\nOrder with Citibank\n(collectively, the 2024\nConsent Orders). In addition,\nthe OCC and Citibank entered\ninto an Amendment (the\nAmendment) to the October 7,\n2020 Consent Order. For\nadditional information about\nthe 2024 Consent Orders and\nthe Amendment, see Citi\u2019s July\n10, 2024 Form 8-K and\n\u201cTransformation Focus Areas\nand Status\u201d and \u201cFRB and OCC\nConsent Orders Compliance\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCiti\u2019s transformation\ninitiatives will take several\nyears to complete, and, as\npreviously disclosed, Citi may\ncontinue to experience\nsignificant challenges in\nsatisfying the regulators\u2019\nexpectations in both\nsufficiency and timing. The\nregulators may also identify\nadditional risk and control\nissues that could result in\nfurther regulatory actions.\nFor additional information\nabout these regulatory risks,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance\nRisks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nNotwithstanding the 2024\nConsent Orders and the\nAmendment, the\ntransformation\u2019s target\noutcomes remain focused on\nchanging Citi\u2019s business and\noperating models such that\nthey simultaneously (i)\nstrengthen controls, enhance\ndata quality, reduce risk and\nimprove Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncompliance and its culture,\nand (ii) enhance Citi\u2019s value\nto customers, clients and\nshareholders.\n                                                                \n  Transformation Focus Areas and Status                         \n                                                                \nOver the last several years,\nCiti has made key investments\nto modernize the Company\u2019s\ninfrastructure, simplify and\nautomate manual processes,\nenhance data quality and\ngovernance, strengthen\ncontrols and reduce risk. In\n2023, Citi incurred\ntransformation-related\nexpenses of $2.9 billion\n(compared to $2.8 billion in\n2022), including significant\ninvestments in technology,\nadditional hiring in data and\nrisk and controls and\ncontracting third-party\nconsultants. Citi\u2019s\ntransformation initiatives\nwill continue to entail\nsignificant investments during\nthe remainder of 2024 and\nbeyond.\n\nCiti completed significant\nplanning and foundational work\nfor the transformation in 2021\nand 2022. In 2023, Citi\nprogressed its transformation\nefforts into implementation\nmode. Citi\u2019s transformation\ninitiatives in the near term\n(the remainder of 2024 through\n2025) will continue to focus\non (i) accelerating progress\non automating regulatory\nprocesses and\n\nin remediating data,\nparticularly related to\nregulatory reporting, and (ii)\nfurther strengthening stress\ntesting and resolution and\nrecovery capabilities.\n                                                                \n  Progress                                                      \n                                                                \nExamples of Citi\u2019s\ntransformation progress to\ndate include the following:\n\nImproved Risk Management\n\n\u2022 Built greater efficiency and\nscale in the risk management\nof Citi\u2019s Global Spread\nProducts business, with 99% of\nrisk computations now\noccurring on cloud-based\ninfrastructure\n\n\u2022 Implemented automated\ncontrols representing more\nthan 80% of transaction\nvolumes across the Markets\nbusiness to avoid manual trade\nerrors\n\nSimplification\n\n\u2022 Retired almost 300 legacy\napplications year-to-date, and\nmore than 1,000 since 2022,\nthereby simplifying its\ntechnology infrastructure and\nenabling greater focus on more\nstrategic platforms\n\n\u2022 Consolidating 20 cash\nequities platforms to one\nmodern platform\n\n\u2022 As of the second quarter of\n2024, reduced time to book new\nor amended loans in North\nAmerica by over 50%\n\nResiliency\n\n\u2022 As of the second quarter of\n2024, improved resiliency and\nreduced downtime by\nsimplifying system restoration\nto a single click for\napproximately 30% of critical\napplications\n\n\u2022 Optimizing virtual workloads\nto reduce data center\nfootprint and lower\noperational costs\n\nNotwithstanding Citi\u2019s\ninvestments and remediation\nefforts, as set forth in the\nFRB\u2019s 2024 Consent Order, the\nFRB found that, based on\nexaminations conducted by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, Citigroup had ongoing\ndeficiencies related to its\ndata quality management\nprogram and inadequate\nmeasures for managing and\ncontrolling its data quality\nrisks. In addition, as set\nforth in the OCC\u2019s 2024\nConsent Order and the\nAmendment, the OCC deemed that\nCitibank had failed to make\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress toward achieving\ncompliance with the OCC\u2019s 2020\nConsent Order.\n                                                                \n  Organizational Simplification                                 \n                                                                \nDuring the first quarter of\n2024, Citi completed its\norganizational simplification\nannounced in September 2023.\nThe result is a simpler\nmanagement structure that\naligns to and facilitates\nCiti\u2019s strategy, while\nimproving accountability and\ndecision making. As of the\nfourth quarter of 2023, Citi\u2019s\nnew operating model included\nthe elimination of the\nInstitutional Clients Group ,\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement and Legacy\nFranchises operating segments\nand resulted in the five\ncurrent reportable operating\nsegments\u2014 Services , Markets ,\nBanking , U.S. Personal\nBanking and Wealth \u2014and a new\nfinancial reporting structure.\nActivities not assigned to the\nreportable operating segments\nare included in All Other ,\nincluding Legacy Franchises\nand Corporate/Other.

The\nOCC and Citibank also entered\ninto an Amendment to the\nOctober 7, 2020 OCC Consent\nOrder. The Amendment requires\nCitibank to formalize a\nprocess to determine whether\nsufficient resources are being\nappropriately allocated toward\nachieving timely and\nsustainable compliance with\nthe OCC\u2019s 2020 Consent Order,\nincluding any requirements on\nwhich Citibank is not making\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress (such process, the\nResource Review Plan).\nCitibank must submit a\nResource Review Plan to the\nOCC within 30 days. While the\nResource Review Plan is being\nfinalized, Citibank will need\nto ensure that the OCC has no\nobjection to payment of\nintercompany dividends from\nCitibank ultimately to\nCitigroup above the amounts\nnecessary for Citigroup debt\nservice, preferred dividends\nand other non-discretionary\nobligations. Copies of the\n2024 Consent Orders and the\nAmendment were included as\nexhibits to Citi\u2019s July 10,\n2024 Form 8-K. For additional\ninformation regarding the 2024\nConsent Orders and the\nAmendment, see the July 10,\n2024 Form 8-K.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation efforts include\neffective implementation of\nthe October 7, 2020 FRB and\nOCC Consent Orders issued to\nCitigroup and Citibank,\nrespectively. The 2020 Consent\nOrders require Citigroup and\nCitibank to implement\nextensive targeted action\nplans and submit quarterly\nprogress reports on a timely\nand sufficient basis,\ndetailing the results and\nstatus of improvements\nrelating principally to\nvarious aspects of (i)\nenterprise-wide risk\nmanagement, (ii) compliance\nrisk management, (iii) data\nquality management and\ngovernance, and (iv) internal\ncontrols. Citi continues to\nwork constructively with the\nFRB and OCC and provide\nadditional information\nregarding its plans and\nprogress to both regulators on\nan ongoing basis. Citi will\ncontinue to reflect their\nfeedback in its project plans\nand execution efforts. For\nadditional information about\nthe requirements under the\n2020 Consent Orders, see\nCiti\u2019s Current Report on Form\n8-K filed with the SEC on\nOctober 9, 2020.\n                                                                \n  Governance                                                    \n                                                                \nCiti has built an organization\nand infrastructure to manage,\nguide and support its\ntransformation, which spans\nall businesses and functions\nto ensure consistency.\nAdditionally, the Citigroup\nand Citibank Boards of\nDirectors each formed a\nTransformation Oversight\nCommittee, an ad hoc committee\nof each Board, to provide\noversight of Citi\u2019s efforts to\nimprove its risk and control\nenvironment and management\u2019s\nremediation efforts under the\nconsent orders.\n\nWhile every member of Citi\u2019s\nexecutive management team, or\nEMT, is involved in the\ntransformation and plays a\n\nkey, direct role in its\nimplementation, Citi\u2019s CEO has\ntaken a leading role in\nmanaging the effort. As part\nof this effort, Citi\u2019s CEO has\nassembled a team consisting of\nlong-tenured colleagues and\nnew hires from across various\ndisciplines and areas of\nexpertise and experience,\nalong with representatives\nfrom each of Citi\u2019s businesses\nand functions, to lead the\nvarious transformation\nprograms. Citi is focusing the\nCompany\u2019s most senior talent\non this effort and has a\ndetailed, integrated approach\nto execute on the\ntransformation. Citi\u2019s\nTransformation Steering\nCommittee, chaired by Citi\u2019s\nCEO, sets the overall\ndirection for the\ntransformation and\ncommunicates progress to the\nCitigroup Board of Directors,\nas well as seeks input and\nfeedback from the Board.\n\nIn 2023, Citi appointed a new\nChief Operating Officer, who\nreports to the CEO and is\nresponsible for running Citi\u2019s\noverall transformation\nefforts, as well as leading\nCiti\u2019s efforts to improve\noperating efficiency and\nreturns along with Citi\u2019s\nenterprise-wide effort to\nstrengthen its risk and\ncontrols and data quality, and\nmodernize infrastructure,\nwhile simplifying the Company.\n                                                                \n  Transformation Bonus Program                                  \n                                                                \nIn 2021, the Compensation,\nPerformance Management and\nCulture Committee (the\nCompensation Committee) of\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\napproved a long-term\nperformance-based bonus\nprogram to incentivize\neffective execution in\nconnection with the\ntransformation and remediation\nof the consent orders and to\ndrive change in Citi\u2019s risk\nand control environment and\nculture (the Transformation\nBonus Program, or the\nProgram). There are currently\n200 senior employees who were\ndeemed critical to the\nexecution of the\ntransformation and are\ntherefore eligible for the\nProgram.\n\nPerformance is measured, and\nthe bonus, if any, payable\npursuant to the Transformation\nBonus Program is paid in three\ntranches, each representing a\nseparate performance period.\nWell-defined goals and related\nmetrics are established for\neach of the three tranches,\nwhich may reflect qualitative\nconsiderations, including\nregulatory actions. At the end\nof each year, the Compensation\nCommittee determines the\nappropriate level of payout\ngiven the accomplishments for\nthe performance period\nrelative to the specific goals\nand related metrics. The\nmaximum portion of the bonus\npayable for each tranche is\n25% for the first tranche, 25%\nfor the second tranche and 50%\nfor the third tranche.\n\nFollowing the completion of\nthe first performance\nmeasurement period under the\nTransformation Bonus Program,\nthe Compensation Committee\ndetermined that the\nPerformance Achievement\nPercentage for the period\nending December 31, 2022 was\n94%, reflecting the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s\nassessment of performance\nrelative to the predetermined\ntargets set for that tranche\nunder the Program. The targets\nestablished for the first\nperformance period included\nCiti\u2019s submission to the FRB\nand OCC of plans to remediate\nthe issues addressed by the\n2020 Consent Orders, and\nobjectively measurable targets\nto assess performance on\ntransformation milestones. The\nCompensation Committee\nrecognized that management\nperformed above 90%\nachievement relative to\ntargets on each metric\ncategory during\n                               9                                \nthe first performance period,\nwith the exception of one (the\npercentage of milestones that\nwere at risk for not being\ncompleted on time) for which\nCiti fell three percentage\npoints short of target.\n\nFollowing the completion of\nthe second performance\nmeasurement period under the\nProgram, the Compensation\nCommittee determined that the\nPerformance Achievement\nPercentage for the period\nending December 31, 2023 was\n80%. The criteria for the\nsecond performance measurement\nperiod were composed of two\nquantitative metrics: timely\nexecution of the commitments\nscheduled to be completed, and\nexecution quality, which is\nthe percentage of those\ncommitments deemed complete by\nCiti\u2019s Internal Audit\nfunction. The third criterion\nfor the second performance\nmeasurement period was a\nqualitative consideration of\nCiti\u2019s cultural change,\nmeasured by its broad-based\n2023 Voice of the Employee\nsurvey designed to measure\ncultural alignment with Citi\u2019s\nLeadership Principles.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has\ndetermined that the metric\ncategories for the third\ntranche of the Program,\ncovering the calendar year\n2024 performance period, will\nbe the same as the metric\ncategories for the second\ntranche. The Compensation\nCommittee has set specific\nobjective targets with respect\nto performance metrics within\nthose categories.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe Transformation Bonus\nProgram, see

partially offset by\nhigher expenses.\n\nRevenues increased 3%,\nprimarily reflecting higher\nrevenues in Securities\nServices, as well as the\nimpact of continued underlying\nmomentum in TTS. The increase\nin revenues was partially\noffset by lower net interest\nincome from the net investment\nin Argentina.\n\nTTS revenues were largely\nunchanged, as a 14% increase\nin non-interest revenue was\noffset by a 3% decrease in net\ninterest income. The increase\nin non-interest revenue was\nprimarily driven by continued\nstrength in underlying fee\ndrivers, including an increase\nin cross-border transaction\nvalue of 6%, an increase in\nU.S. dollar clearing volume of\n7% and an increase in\ncommercial card spend volume\nof 4%. The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was also\ndriven by a smaller impact\nfrom currency devaluation in\nArgentina. The decrease in net\ninterest income was driven by\nlower revenues from the net\ninvestment in Argentina,\npartially offset by the\nbenefit of higher U.S. and\nnon-U.S. interest rates\nrelative to the prior-year\nperiod.

The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was primarily\ndriven by fee growth due to 9%\ngrowth in AUC/AUA balances,\nbenefiting from new client\nonboarding, deepening\nrelationships with existing\nclients and higher market\nvaluations.\n\nExpenses were up 9%, largely\ndriven by an Argentina-related\ntransaction tax expense, a\nlegal settlement expense and\ncontinued investments in\nproduct innovation and\ntechnology.\n\nProvisions were a benefit of\n$27 million, compared to $223\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The current-quarter\nACL release was largely due to\nan improved macroeconomic\noutlook.

The increase in\nnon-interest revenue reflected\ncontinued growth in underlying\nfee drivers, including higher\ncross-border transaction value\n(up 7%), U.S. dollar clearing\nvolume (up 5%) and commercial\ncard spend volume (up 5%).\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nincreased 14%, as net interest\nincome grew 15% and non-\ninterest revenue grew 14%. The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was driven by spread\nimprovement from higher\ninterest rates across\ncurrencies and deposit mix.\nThe increase in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by the same\nfactors described above, as\nwell as continued elevated\nlevels of corporate activity\nin Issuer Services.\n\nExpenses were up 10%,\nprimarily driven by an\nArgentina-related transaction\ntax expense, a legal\nsettlement expense, continued\ninvestment in technology and\nother risk and controls and\nbusiness-led investments.\n\nProvisions were $37 million,\ncompared to $209 million in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby the ACL release in the\nsecond quarter of 2024,\nprimarily due to the improved\nmacroeconomic outlook.\n                               18                               \n                                                                \n  MARKETS                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets provides corporate, institutional and public sector\nclients around the world with a full range of sales and trading\nservices across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread\nproducts and commodities. The range of services includes market-\nmaking across asset classes, risk management solutions,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and\nsettlement.\n\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including\nholding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the\ndifferential between the price at which it buys and sells the\nproducts. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and\nlosses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions .\nOther primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity\nsecurities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring\ngains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less\ninterest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding\ntransactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest\nincome.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market variables such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor\nconfidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues\ninclude revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue\nsharing arrangement with Banking \u2014Corporate Lending for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in\nclient activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. Management of the\nMarkets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of\nthe above factors.\n\nMarkets \u2019 international presence is supported by trading floors\nin approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95\ncountries and jurisdictions.\n                                                                \n  \u2026

higher cost of credit,\npartially offset by higher\nrevenues and lower expenses.\n\nRevenues increased 6%, due to\nhigher net interest income (up\n5%), largely driven by loan\ngrowth in cards, as well as\nhigher non-interest revenue\n(up 30%). The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was largely\ndriven by lower partner\npayments in Retail Services,\ndue to higher net credit\nlosses.\n\nCards revenues increased 7%.\nBranded Cards revenues\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby interest-earning balance\ngrowth (up 9%), as payment\nrates continued to moderate,\nand card spend volumes growth.\nBranded Cards average loans\nincreased 10%, reflecting the\nhigher card spend volumes and\nthe lower card payment rates.\nBranded Cards card spend\nvolume increased 3%, driven by\nmore affluent customers.\n\nRetail Services revenues\nincreased 6%, primarily driven\nby higher non-interest revenue\ndue to the lower partner\npayments, driven by the higher\nnet credit losses (see\n\u201cProvisions\u201d below and Note\n5), as well as higher net\ninterest income on higher\ninterest-earning balances (up\n8%). Retail Services average\nloans increased 4%, largely\nreflecting lower card payment\nrates, and card spend volumes\ndecreased 4%, primarily due to\ncontinued lower in-store foot\ntraffic.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\nincreased 3%, primarily driven\nby higher deposit spreads, as\nwell as mortgage and\ninstallment loan growth,\npartially offset by the impact\nof the transfers of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth . Average mortgage\nloans increased 14%, primarily\ndriven by lower refinancings\ndue to high interest rates and\nmortgage originations\nexceeding prepayments. Average\ndeposits decreased 18%,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfers of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\n($27 billion over the last 12\nmonths).\n\nExpenses decreased 2%, driven\nby lower technology and\ncompensation costs, partially\noffset by higher volume-\nrelated expenses.\n\nProvisions were $2.3 billion,\ncompared to $1.5 billion in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby higher net credit losses\nand a higher net ACL build for\nloans. Net credit losses\nincreased 59%, primarily\nreflecting the maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years,\nincluding those with delayed\nlosses due to unprecedented\nlevels of government stimulus\nduring the pandemic. In\naddition, the increase was due\nto macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the continued\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios, with lower FICO\nband customers driving the\nincrease. Branded Cards net\ncredit losses were up 69% to\n$1 billion and Retail Services\nnet credit losses of $0.8\nbillion were up 50%.\n\nThe net ACL build was $0.4\nbillion, compared to $0.3\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL build in\nthe current quarter primarily\nreflected cards loan growth.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nUSPB \u2019s Branded Cards, Retail\nServices and Retail Banking\nloan portfolios, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to USPB \u2019s\nfuture results, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  2Q24 YTD vs. 2Q23 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nYear-to-date, USPB experienced\nsimilar trends to those\ndescribed above.

The ratio\nincreased from the fourth\nquarter of 2023, primarily\ndriven by an increase in Tier\n1 Capital due to year-to-date\nnet income of $6.9 billion and\na decrease in Total Leverage\nExposure, partially offset by\nthe payment of common and\npreferred dividends.\n                               42                               \nImpact of Changes on Citigroup\nand Citibank Capital Ratios\n\nThe following tables present\nthe estimated sensitivity of\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncapital ratios to changes of\n$100 million in CET1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital and Total\nCapital (numerator), and\nchanges of $1 billion in\nAdvanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach risk-\nweighted assets and quarterly\nadjusted average total assets,\nas well as Total Leverage\nExposure (denominator), as of\nJune 30, 2024.

Citi continues\nto monitor the joint\nregulators\u2019 review of and\ndiscussions related to the new\nregulations following the\nindustry comment period,\nincluding recent comments by\nthe Chair of the FRB.\n\nThe capital proposal would\nmaintain the current capital\nrule\u2019s dual-requirement\nstructure for risk-weighted\nassets, but would eliminate\nthe use of internal models to\ncalculate credit risk and\noperational risk components of\nRWA. The capital proposal\nwould also replace the current\nmarket risk framework with a\nnew standardized methodology\nand a new models-based\nmethodology for calculating\nRWA for market risk. Large\nbanking organizations, such as\nCiti, would be required to\ncalculate their risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized\nApproach and use the lower of\nthe two for each risk-based\ncapital ratio for determining\nthe binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational RWA amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nRWA amounts would also affect\nseveral other requirements\nincluding TLAC, external long-\nterm debt and the short-term\nwholesale funding score\nincluded in the GSIB surcharge\nunder method 2 (see \u201cGSIB\nSurcharge\u201d below). The\nproposal has a three-year\ntransition period that would\nbegin on July 1, 2025.

Proposed changes\ninclude measuring certain\nsystemic indicators on a daily\nversus quarterly average\nbasis, changing certain of the\nrisk indicators and shortening\nthe time to come into\ncompliance with each year\u2019s\nsurcharge. In addition, the\nproposal would narrow\nsurcharge bands under method 2\nfrom 50 bps to 10 bps to\nreduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the FRB\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking to amend the TLAC\nrule to change the haircuts\n(i.e., the percentage\nreductions) that are applied\nto eligible long-term debt.\nUnder the proposed rule, only\n50% of eligible long-term debt\nwith a maturity of one year or\nmore but less than two years\nwould count toward the TLAC\nrequirement, instead of the\ncurrent 100%. These proposed\nrevisions are estimated to\ndecrease the TLAC percentage\nof Advanced Approaches RWA as\nwell as the TLAC percentage of\nTotal Leverage Exposure. The\nproposed rule in its current\nform has no proposed\ntransition period for its\nimplementation and is not\nexpected to be material to\nCiti.\n                               45                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)).

Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

In advance of the\nexpiration of partial-term\neconomic hedges, Citi will\ndetermine, among other\nfactors, the economic\nfeasibility of hedging the\nremaining life of the\ninstrument. The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At June 30, 2024,\nMarch 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, Banking had economic\nhedges on the corporate credit\nportfolio of $39.7 billion,\n$38.4 billion and $35.9\nbillion, respectively. Citi\u2019s\nexpected credit loss model\nused in the calculation of its\nACL does not include the\nfavorable impact of credit\nderivatives and other\nmitigants that are marked-to-\nmarket. In addition, the\nreported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 14. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe second quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nBanking was broadly stable\nquarter-over-quarter, and\nincreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the growth\nand seasoning of personal\nloans. The 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter,\nand decreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by lower\ndelinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nAs indicated above, Wealth\nprovides consumer mortgages,\nmargin lending, credit cards\nand other lending products to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom affluent to ultra-high\nnet worth through the Private\nBank, Wealth at Work and\nCitigold businesses. These\ncustomer segments represent a\ntarget market that is\ncharacterized by historically\nlow default rates and\ndelinquencies and includes\nloans that are delinquency\nmanaged or classifiably\nmanaged. The delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio consists\nprimarily of mortgages, margin\nlending and credit cards. As\nof June 30, 2024,\napproximately $44 billion, or\n29%, of the portfolios were\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 75% were\nrated investment grade. While\nthe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates shown in the\nchart above were calculated\nonly for the delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio, the net\ncredit loss rates shown were\ncalculated using net credit\nlosses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe second quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nWealth were broadly stable\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year. The low net credit\nloss and 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\n                               56                               \n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As presented\nin the chart above, the second\nquarter of 2024 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\ndecreased quarter-over-\nquarter, primarily driven by\nseasonality, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of loss rates\nfrom post-pandemic lows.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $63 million ($0.5 billion), $64 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $73 million ($0.5 billion) at June 30, 2024, March\n31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The amounts excluded\nfor loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans\nhave the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans)\nwere $75 million, $66 million and $68 million at June 30, 2024,\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The EOP loans in\nthe table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail\nServices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status and therefore,\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30,\n2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, 75%, 81% and 97% of\nWealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade.\nFor additional information on the credit quality of the Wealth\nportfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see\n\u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and\nRussia for all periods presented.\n\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nConsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and, hence, the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nmost recent reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and\nIndonesia in the first quarter of 2022; Taiwan closed in the\nthird quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the fourth quarter\nof 2023. In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the\nfirst quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second\nquarter of 2023. See Note 2.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies.

Corporate non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 68%, 61%, 50%, 62% and 51% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal\npayments at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023,\nSeptember 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n(3) The June 30, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.33% of total corporate loans.\n\n(4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to\ntwo commercial real estate loans. The decrease at June 30, 2024\nwas primarily related to commercial real estate loans.\n\n(5) Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all\nperiods presented.\n

Liquidity\nRisk Management Policy\n(Policy), which sets forth the\nminimum requirements for\nidentifying, measuring,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting liquidity risk,\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite in conjunction with\nlocal treasurers and with\noversight provided by\nIndependent Risk Management\nand the Citigroup Asset and\nLiability Committee (ALCO).\nThe Policy establishes the\nframework for sound management\nof Citi\u2019s liquidity risk, to\nfacilitate transparency and\ncomparability of liquidity\nrisk-taking activities, and\nsupports Citi\u2019s maintenance of\nadequate liquidity, including\na cushion of unencumbered,\nhigh-quality liquid assets, to\nwithstand a range of stress\nevents including those\ninvolving the loss or\nimpairment of both unsecured\nand secured funding sources.\n\nCiti\u2019s enterprise-wide\nliquidity management framework\nestablishes a risk appetite\nthat is expressed as a set of\nquantitative minimum levels\nfor Citigroup and Citibank,\nconsolidated to maintain\nliquidity levels above limits\nfor the U.S. Liquidity\nCoverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net\nStable Funding ratio (NSFR)\nand Internal Liquidity Stress\nTests (ILST). Liquidity\nconcentration risk, which is\ndefined as liquidity risk due\nto funding concentration to a\nspecific counterparty,\nindustry, product type or\nmaturity, among other\ncategories, is an integral\npart of Citi\u2019s liquidity\nmanagement framework and is\nmanaged in accordance with\nestablished risk appetite\nlimits. For example, product\nconcentration limits consider\nspecific attributes of a\nproduct (e.g., wholesale\ndeposits, secured versus\nunsecured, etc.).\n\nSimilar requirements\napplicable to country legal\nentities, material legal\nentities (as defined in the\npublic section of Citi\u2019s 2023\nresolution plan) or other\nlegal entities are specified\nin the Liquidity Risk\nManagement Procedures\n(Procedures). The Procedures\nprovide for liquidity risk\nmanagement, risk\nidentification, risk appetite,\nrisk limits and triggers, and\nmonitoring including\nescalation, stress testing,\nrisk reporting, training and\nreview, oversight and approval\nof key liquidity risk\nproposals, and analytical\ntools applicable to the\nentities within the\nProcedures\u2019 scope. In\naddition, the Procedures\nprovide for data governance,\nroles and responsibilities,\nand reference to frameworks\nwithin Citi\u2019s liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nLiquidity risk in foreign\njurisdictions and legal\nentities is managed as part of\nCiti\u2019s legal entity liquidity\nmanagement framework (similar\nto Citigroup and Citibank), in\nwhich legal entities,\nincluding those in foreign\njurisdictions, are subject to\nregulatory and internal\nliquidity stress tests on a\nstandalone basis, managed\nagainst legal entity limits\nset in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite and governed by\nlocal governance forums.

For securities,\nthe amounts represent the\nliquidity value that\npotentially could be realized\nand, therefore, exclude any\nsecurities that are encumbered\nand incorporate any haircuts\napplicable under the U.S. LCR\nrule. The table above\nincorporates various\nrestrictions that could limit\nthe transferability of\nliquidity between legal\nentities, including Section\n23A of the Federal Reserve\nAct. Changes in HQLA line\ncategories from prior periods\nwere primarily driven by the\nre-allocation of\nnontransferable HQLA, which\ndid not change total average\nHQLA, and thus did not impact\nCiti\u2019s LCR ratio.\n\n(1) Foreign government debt\nincludes securities issued or\nguaranteed by foreign\nsovereigns, agencies and\nmultilateral development\nbanks. Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Korea, Mexico, India\nand Hong Kong.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR\nrules. These amounts include\nthe HQLA needed to meet the\nminimum requirements at these\nentities as well as any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the second quarter of\n2024, primarily driven by a\nreduction in short-term\nborrowings. As of June 30,\n2024, Citigroup had\napproximately $899 billion of\navailable liquidity resources\nto support client and business\nneeds, including end-of-period\nHQLA ($528 billion);\nadditional unencumbered HQLA,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup\n($239 billion); and unused\nborrowing capacity from\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support additional\nadvances from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow ($132 billion).\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR.

End-of-period\ndeposits decreased 3% year-\nover-year, largely due to a\ndecline in TTS in Services ,\nprimarily reflecting\nquantitative tightening. End-\nof-period deposits decreased\n2% sequentially, primarily\ndriven by seasonal outflows\nand transfer to investments in\nWealth as well as non-\noperating outflows in TTS. On\nan average basis, deposits\ndeclined 2% year-over-year and\ndecreased 1% sequentially. In\nthe second quarter of 2024,\naverage deposits for: \u2022\nServices decreased 1% year-\nover-year, as TTS decreased\n2%, partially offset by an\nincrease in Securities\nServices of 2%. This net\ndecline reflected the impact\nof quantitative tightening and\nnon-operating deposit\noutflows. \u2022 USPB decreased 18%\nyear-over-year, as the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\nmore than offset the\nunderlying growth. \u2022 Wealth\nincreased 2% year-over-year,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits from USPB\n, partially offset by the\nshift in deposits to higher-\nyielding investments on Citi\u2019s\nplatform. \u2022 All Other\ndecreased 7% year-over-year,\nprimarily as a result of the\ncontinued wind-downs of Asia\nConsumer and the U.K. retail\nbanking business. The majority\nof Citi\u2019s $1.3 trillion of\nend-of-period deposits are\ninstitutional (approximately\n$807 billion) and span 90\ncountries. A large majority of\nthese institutional deposits\nare within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from\nclients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments\nand collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital\nsolutions.

As of June 30, 2024, non-bank\nincluded $83.4 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into\nCitigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are\nalso included in this line. (2) Local country and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s affiliates in support of their local\noperations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also\nincluded. (3) Predominantly credit card securitizations,\nprimarily backed by Branded Cards receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding increased 2% year-over-year, largely\ndriven by increased senior benchmark debt, FHLB borrowings by\nthe bank and subordinated debt at the non-bank entities. The\nincrease was partially offset by a decline in customer-related\ndebt and senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt outstanding decreased 2%, largely\nrelated to customer-related debt redemptions. As part of its\nliability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to\nconsider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term\ndebt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other\nmeans. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi\u2019s\noverall funding costs. During the second quarter of 2024, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an aggregate of $16.3 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               70

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nissuances and borrowings from\nthe FHLB and other market\nparticipants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $305\nbillion as of June 30, 2024\nincreased 17% year-over-year\nand 2% sequentially, largely\ndriven by additional financing\nto support increases in\ntrading-related assets within\nCiti\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. As of the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024,\non an average basis, secured\nfunding was $336 billion. The\nportion of secured funding in\nthe broker-dealer subsidiaries\nthat funds secured lending is\ncommonly referred to as\n\u201cmatched book\u201d activity and is\nprimarily secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other \u201cmatched\nbook\u201d activity is secured by\nless liquid securities,\nincluding equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-\nbacked securities, the tenor\nof which is generally equal to\nor longer than the tenor of\nthe corresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $39 billion as of June 30,\n2024 decreased 4% year-over-\nyear, as issuances of long-\nterm debt replaced the need\nfor short-term borrowings.\nSequentially, short-term\nborrowings increased 21%,\ncompared to March 31, 2024,\ndriven by additional funding\nto support client activities\n(see Note 18 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               72                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of June 30, 2024.\nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.1\nbillion (compared to $0.3\nbillion as of March 31, 2024).\nOther funding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of June 30, 2024,\nCiti estimates that a one-\nnotch downgrade of Citigroup\nInc. and Citibank across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould result in increased\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $0.2 billion,\ncompared to $0.6 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2024. As detailed\nunder \u201cHigh-Quality Liquid\nAssets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of June 30,\n2024, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$10.8 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits (compared to $11.1\nbillion at March 31, 2024)\n(see Note 21).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               73                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nCiti utilizes the most recent\nquarter-end balance sheet,\nassuming no changes to its\ncomposition and size over the\nforecasted horizon (holding\nthe balance sheet static). The\nforecasts incorporate\nexpectations and assumptions\nof deposit pricing, loan\nspreads and mortgage\nprepayment behavior implied by\nthe interest rate curves in\neach scenario. The base case\nscenario reflects the market-\nimplied forward interest\nrates, and sensitivity\nscenarios assume instantaneous\nshocks to the base case. The\nforecasts do not assume Citi\ntakes any risk-mitigating\nactions in response to changes\nin the interest rate\nenvironment. Certain interest\nrates are subject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas) are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa. Citi manages EVS\nwithin risk limits approved by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\nthat are aligned with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite.\n                               74                               \nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\non AOCI\n\nCiti measures the potential\nimpacts of changes in interest\nrates on the value of its AOCI\n, which can in turn impact\nCiti\u2019s common equity and\ntangible common equity. This\nwill impact Citi\u2019s CET1 and\nother regulatory capital\nratios. Citi seeks to manage\nits exposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential\n\nchanges in AOCI (and the\ncorresponding impact on the\nCET1 Capital ratio) relative\nto Citi\u2019s capital generation\ncapacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates, as\npotential monetary policy\ndecisions and changes in\neconomic conditions may be\nreflected in current market-\nimplied forward rates.

The\nremaining balance is spread\nacross more than 30 additional\ncurrencies.\n\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet is asset\nsensitive (assets reprice\nfaster than liabilities),\nresulting in higher net\ninterest income in increasing\ninterest rate scenarios. The\nestimated impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income in a 100 bps\nupward rate shock scenario as\nof June 30, 2024 decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily\nreflecting the net impact of\nlower expected gains due to\nU.S. dollar interest rate\nmoves that have already been\nrealized and changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet. At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity. Currency-specific\ninterest rate changes and\nbalance sheet factors may\ndrive quarter-to-quarter\nvolatility in Citi\u2019s estimated\nIRE.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $1.1 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately six\nmonths.\n                               75                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income and AOCI\nunder six different scenarios\nof changes in interest rates\nfor the U.S. dollar and all\nother currencies in which Citi\nhas invested capital as of\nJune 30, 2024. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios\npotentially may be impacted by\nthe low level of interest\nrates in several countries and\nthe assumption that market\ninterest rates, as well as\nrates paid to depositors and\ncharged to borrowers, do not\nfall below zero (i.e., the\n\u201cflooring assumption\u201d). The\ninterest rate scenarios are\nalso impacted by convexity\nrelated to mortgage products\nand deposit pricing.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  as                                                            \n  o\u2026                                                            \n  n\u2026                                                            \n  O\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  1\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026       Sc\u2026       Sc\u2026       S\u2026       Sc\u2026       S\u2026       Sc\u2026  \n  I\u2026         1         2        3         4        5         6  \n  r\u2026       100       100        \u2014         \u2014       (\u2026       (1\u2026  \n  e\u2026       100         \u2014       1\u2026       (1\u2026        \u2014       (1\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U\u2026    $  -4\u2026    $  -5\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  -1\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  -2\u2026  \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  o\u2026       1,\u2026       1,\u2026       2\u2026       -2\u2026       -\u2026       -1\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026    $  976    $  649    $  3\u2026    $  -3\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  -1\u2026  \n  E\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026    $  -1\u2026    $  -1\u2026    $  91    $  -3\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  858  \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  t\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously.

The\ninterest rate exposure in the\ntable above assumes no change\nin deposit size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast included\nin the different interest\nscenarios presented. As a\nresult, in higher interest\nrate scenarios, customer\nactivity resulting in a shift\nfrom non-interest-bearing and\nlow interest rate deposit\nproducts to higher-yielding\ndeposits would reduce the\nexpected benefit to net\ninterest income. Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) The Scenario 1 impact of\n$1,382 million consists of the\nfollowing top five non-U.S.\ndollar currencies as of June\n30, 2024 by absolute size:\napproximately $(0.2) billion\nfrom the euro, $0.2 billion\neach from the British pound\nsterling and Japanese yen, and\napproximately $0.1 billion\neach from the Indian rupee and\nChinese yuan. The remaining\nbalance is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger under Scenario 2 than\nScenario 3, as Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook has relatively higher\ninterest rate exposure to the\nshort end of the yield curve.\nFor U.S. dollars, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude than to\nupward rate shocks. This is\nbecause of the lower benefit\nto net interest income from\nCiti\u2019s deposit base at higher\nrate levels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and pension\nliabilities are more sensitive\nto rates at shorter- and\nintermediate-term maturities.\n                               76                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, euro, Singapore\ndollar and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value\n\nof Citi\u2019s RWA denominated in\nthose currencies. This,\ncoupled with Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency hedging strategies,\nsuch as foreign currency\nborrowings, foreign currency\nforwards and other currency\nhedging instruments, lessens\nthe impact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are presented\nin the table below.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of June 30, 2024, there were two back-\ntesting exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of June 30, 2024.\n(Including the U.S., Citi\u2019s\ntop 25 exposures by country\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries as of June 30,\n2024.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 40% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (46% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n90% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 85% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of June\n30, 2024.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

The increase in\nexposures was primarily driven\nby inflows from dividends\nreceived from Russian\ncorporations on behalf of\nCiti\u2019s clients. Approximately\n77% of Citi\u2019s $8.2 billion of\ntotal Russia exposures are\ncorporate dividends that Citi\ncannot remit to its clients\ndue to restrictions imposed by\nthe Russian government, of\nwhich $5.3 billion is held\nwith the Deposit Insurance\nAgency as of June 30, 2024.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $0.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2024\n(down from $0.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2024).\n\nCiti hedges its Russian\nruble/U.S. dollar spot FX\nexposure in AOCI through the\npurchase of FX derivatives.\nThe ongoing mark-to-market of\nthe hedging derivatives is\nalso reported in AOCI . When\nthe Russian ruble depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, the\nU.S. dollar equivalent value\nof Citigroup\u2019s investment in\nAO Citibank also declines.\nThis change in value is offset\nby the change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nServices , Markets , Banking\nand All Other \u2014Legacy\nFranchises results have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including the\nwar in Ukraine and its direct\nand indirect impacts on the\nEuropean and global economies.\nFor a broader discussion of\nthese factors and volatilities\non Citi\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\napplicable business\u2019s results\nof operations above.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.1 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct\nRussian counterparties\n(largely unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2023). This\nbalance does not include the\nadditional reserves for\ntransfer risk for exposures in\nRussia.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $67 million to-\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $54 million in\nestimated charges\n(approximately $1 million in\nBanking and $53 million in All\nOther , excluding the impact\nfrom any portfolio sales).

As of\nJune 30, 2024, Citi continued\nto consolidate AO Citibank\nbecause none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi\u2019s foreign\nentity in Russia, Citi would\nbe required to (i) write off\nthe net investment of\napproximately $0.1 billion\n(down from $0.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2024), (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\n(unchanged from March 31,\n2024) through earnings and\n(iii) recognize a loss of $0.7\nbillion (up from $0.6 billion\nas of March 31, 2024) on net\nintercompany liabilities owed\nby AO Citibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or\n                               88                               \nblock the funds until\napplicable sanctions are\nlifted or the payments are\notherwise authorized under\napplicable law.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its remaining\npresence in Russia and\nassociation with Russian\nindividuals or entities,\nwhether subject to sanctions\nor not, including Citi\u2019s\ninability to support its\nglobal clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

The reports to the\nBoard and its Committees from\nsenior management who\nrepresent the impacted\nbusinesses and the\ninternational cluster,\nIndependent Risk Management,\nFinance, Independent\nCompliance Risk Management,\nincluding those individuals\nresponsible for sanctions\ncompliance, and Human\nResources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 220\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. As of\nJune 30, 2024, Citi had $1.5\nbillion of direct exposures\nrelated to Ukraine (compared\nto $1.4 billion at March 31,\n2024).\n                               89                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses. As of\nJune 30, 2024, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.4 billion (compared to $1.6\nbillion at March 31, 2024).\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar\n(USD) as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries such as Argentina\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary in accordance\nwith GAAP. Citi therefore\nrecords the impact of exchange\nrate fluctuations on its net\nArgentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings. Citi\nuses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net ARS-\ndenominated assets into USD.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the\nofficial ARS exchange rate was\n911.50, which devalued by 6%\nagainst the USD during the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\n\nThe decrease in Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina during\nthe quarter was primarily\ndriven by capital\nrepatriations from the onshore\nnet investment, which were\nauthorized by the Central Bank\nof Argentina (BCRA) on a one-\ntime basis in April 2024\nthrough the purchase of\ncertain USD-denominated bonds\n(BOPREALs) issued by the BCRA\nin a primary auction, and\nsubsequent sales of the bonds\nin the secondary market and\nremittances of the bond\nproceeds to the parent entity\noutside Argentina. During the\nsecond quarter, Citi remitted\na total of approximately $190\nmillion in dividends from its\nnet investment in Argentina,\nthereby reducing future FX\ndevaluation risk. Citi expects\nto remit additional dividends\nduring the third quarter\nfollowing further sales of the\nBCRA bonds, though the final\namount to be remitted is\nsubject to the sales proceeds\non the bonds.\n\nIn addition to the capital\nrepatriation, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina was\nalso impacted by earnings from\nCiti\u2019s normal onshore\noperations and interest income\nearned on the net investment,\nwhich were partially offset by\na transaction tax expense and\nmark-to-market impacts on the\nBCRA bonds purchased for the\ndividend remittance, as well\nas FX translation losses on\nthe net investment.\n\nOther than the authorized\ndividend remittance described\nabove, the BCRA continues to\nmaintain certain capital and\ncurrency controls that\ngenerally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access USD in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nThe capital and currency\ncontrols have resulted in\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms that some Argentine\nentities may use to obtain\nUSD, generally at rates that\nare significantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\ngenerally precluded from\naccessing these alternative\nmechanisms, and under U.S.\nGAAP, these exchange\nmechanisms cannot be used to\nre-measure Citi\u2019s net monetary\nassets into USD. If\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate further converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations.\n\nOf the $1.4 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nJune 30, 2024, Citi\u2019s net ARS\nexposure was approximately\n$0.8 billion. The net ARS\nexposure was reduced as of the\nend of the quarter as a result\nof Citi holding approximately\n$200 million of USD-\ndenominated loans as well as\napproximately $400 million of\ncertain local government bonds\nthat are either USD\ndenominated or are indexed to\nthe higher of the USD exchange\nrate or the local inflation\nindex. If Citi had not\ninvested in such instruments\nto reduce its ARS exposure,\nCiti would have recognized\nadditional translation losses\nduring the second quarter of\n2024. Given current economic\nconditions and the local\ncapital, currency and\nregulatory limitations, Citi\ncannot guarantee the\navailability or effectiveness\nof such mechanisms to reduce\nits ARS exposure in the\nfuture.\n\nIn addition to reducing the\nARS exposure, Citi also seeks\nto economically hedge the\nexposure to the extent\npossible and prudent using\nnon-deliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of June 30,\n2024, Citi was unable to hedge\na substantial portion of the\nremaining ARS exposure, given\nthat the\n\noffshore NDF market remained\nilliquid. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute additional NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net ARS-denominated assets\nin earnings, without any\nbenefit from a change in the\nfair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure. Citi\ncannot predict the\navailability of hedging\ninstruments in the future nor\ncan it predict changes in\nforeign exchange rates and the\nresulting impact on earnings.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of June 30,\n2024.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\ncredit losses are capped at\nthe difference between the\nfair value and amortized cost\nof the security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.\n                               91                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the second\nquarter of 2024.

See \u201c All\nOther \u2014Divestiture-Related\nImpacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d\nabove.\n\n(2) Includes Legacy Franchises\ncorporate loans activity\nrelated to Mexico SBMM and the\nAssets Finance Group (AFG)\n(AFG was previously reported\nin Markets : all periods have\nbeen reclassified to reflect\nthis move into Legacy\nFranchises), as well as other\nLegacy Holdings Assets (LHA)\ncorporate loans.\n\n(3) As of June 30, 2024, in\nUSPB , Branded Cards ACLL/EOP\nloans was 6.4% and Retail\nServices ACLL/EOP loans was\n11.9%.\n\n(4) Includes ACL on Other\nassets and Held-to-maturity\ndebt securities . The ACL on\nOther assets includes ACL\nrelated to transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. for safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables are reflected in\nOther assets . These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\n\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover a R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for all loans\nis eight quarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                               92                               \nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the credit\nenvironment and other factors\nas required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are the following: \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S. for\ncertain safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law \u2022 Potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainties, including\nthose related to potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices and geopolitical\ntensions \u2022 Risk associated\nwith consumer payment behavior\ngiven the higher inflationary\nand interest rate environment\nAs of the second quarter of\n2024, Citi\u2019s qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL decreased\nquarter-over-quarter. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby the full release of\nCOVID-19\u2013related uncertainty\nreserves, as the portfolio\ndelinquencies and losses have\nincreased and these risks are\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent of the ACL,\npartially offset by a build\nfor risks associated with\nconsumer payment behavior\ngiven the higher inflationary\nand interest rate environment.\nMacroeconomic Variables As\nfurther discussed below, Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nglobal macroeconomic variables\nfor the base, upside and\ndownside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.\n\nThe tables below present\nCiti\u2019s forecasted quarterly\naverage U.S. unemployment rate\nand year-over-year U.S. real\nGDP growth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL for each quarterly\nreporting period from the\nsecond quarter of 2023 to the\nsecond quarter of 2024:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            3Q24       1Q25       3Q25       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.5  %     4.4  %     4.4  %         4.3  %  \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.3        4.3            4.2     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.3        4.2            4.2     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.0        4.1        4.1            4.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.0        4.1        4.1            4.1     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2024       2025       2026     \n  Citi forecast                   0.7  %     2.0  %     2.1  %  \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.0        2.0        2.4     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.4        1.7        2.1     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.3        1.8        2.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.4        1.8        2.0     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof the second quarter of 2024,\nU.S. real GDP growth is\nexpected to slow during 2025,\nwhile the unemployment rate is\nexpected to increase slightly\nover the eight-quarter\nforecast horizon. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.4% in the fourth quarter\nof 2025. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2025 of 1.9%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.3%. Citi\u2019s ACL\nis sensitive to the various\nmacroeconomic scenarios that\ndrive the quantitative\ncomponent of expected credit\nlosses, due to changes in the\nlength and severity of\nforecasted economic variables\nor events in the respective\nscenarios. To demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of June 30, 2024\nto reflect the most severe\neconomic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\n                               93                               \nmacroeconomic scenarios. Since\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions, applying a 100%\ndownside scenario weight would\nresult in a hypothetical\nincrease in the ACL of\napproximately $5.0 billion\nrelated to lending exposures,\nexcept for loans individually\nevaluated for credit losses\nand other financial assets\ncarried at amortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of June 30,\n2024.\n\n2Q24 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe second quarter of 2024 was\n$21.8 billion, a slight\nincrease from March 31, 2024.\nThe net build of $0.2 billion\nin the quarter was primarily\ndriven by higher loan balances\nin U.S. cards in the quarter.\nThese builds were partially\noffset by releases in Services\n, Markets , Banking and Wealth\n, all driven primarily by an\nimproved macroeconomic outlook\nin addition to changes in\nportfolio composition driving\nthe release in Markets . Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof June 30, 2024. See Note 15\nfor additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL build was\n$0.4 billion in the second\nquarter of 2024, as a result\nof higher cards loan balances,\npartially offset by a release\nin Wealth driven by\nimprovements in macroeconomic\noutlook. This resulted in a\nJune 30, 2024 ACLL balance of\n$15.7 billion, or 4.08% of\ntotal funded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans decreased\nslightly to 8.14% at June 30,\n2024, compared to 8.16% at\nMarch 31, 2024, primarily\nrelated to an increase in loan\nbalances, as well as impacts\nfrom an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.09% at June\n30, 2024, compared to 1.16% at\nMarch 31, 2024.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of $0.3 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2024,\nlargely driven by an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook in\nServices , Markets and Banking\nin addition to the release in\nMarkets due to changes in the\ncomposition of the portfolio.\nThis resulted in a June 30,\n2024 ACLL balance of $2.5\nbillion, or 0.85% of total\nfunded corporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\nless than $0.1 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2024,\nprimarily in Banking . The\nACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, was $1.6 billion at June 30,\n2024.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build of $0.1\nbillion on other financial\nassets carried at amortized\ncost for the second quarter of\n2024. Including FX/Other, the\nACL reserve balance increased\n$0.2 billion to $2.0 billion\nas of June 30, 2024, compared\nto $1.8 billion as of March\n31, 2024. See Note 15 for\nadditional information.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti elected the modified CECL\ntransition provision for\nregulatory capital purposes\nprovided by the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 final rule.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from the adoption of\nCECL, as well as the ongoing\nadjustments for 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021, started to\nbe phased in on January 1,\n2022 and will be fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 15 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests for goodwill\nimpairment annually as of\nOctober 1 (the annual test)\nand conducts interim\nassessments between annual\ntests if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that\nwould more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nThe impairment tests performed\nin the fourth quarter of 2023\nresulted in the fair values of\nCiti\u2019s reporting units\nexceeding their carrying\nvalues for all reporting\nunits. Additionally, the tests\nresults showed that the fair\nvalue of the Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM reporting unit\nas a percentage of its\ncarrying value was 106%, with\nthe carrying value including\napproximately $1.1 billion of\ngoodwill. For each of the\nremaining reporting units,\nfair value exceeded carrying\nvalue by at least 10%.\n\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nexecutes on its transformation\nand strategy.

The quarter-over-quarter increase was a result of\ntemporary differences and the year-over-year increase was\nprimarily a result of Citi\u2019s geographic mix of earnings. Of\nCiti\u2019s $30.2 billion of net DTAs, $13.6 billion (compared to\n$14.1 billion at March 31, 2024) was deducted in calculating\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital, and the remaining $16.6 billion was\nappropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules. The $13.6\nbillion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of\n$11.7 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $3.7 billion\nof temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory\nlimitations, reduced by $1.8 billion of deferred tax\nliabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain\nother intangible assets that were separately deducted from\ncapital. DTA Realizability Citi believes that realization of the\nnet DTAs of $30.2 billion at June 30, 2024 is more-likely-than-\nnot, based on management\u2019s expectations of future taxable income\ngeneration in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well\nas consideration of available tax planning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).\n                               95                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nJune 30, 2024. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure may be required\neven where the activities,\ntransactions or dealings were\nconducted in compliance with\napplicable law.

During the second\nquarter of 2024, Citi\nidentified 27 transactions\npursuant to Section 219. The\ntransactions were identified\nas the result of a process\nenhancement to a specific\npayment method.\n\nBetween October 2019 and\nAugust 2023, Citibank Europe\nplc processed 27 payments on\nbehalf of an airline to an\nairport management company\nowned by the Iranian\ngovernment for charges related\nto flights over Iranian\nairspace.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer.\n\n(4) Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities represent non-cash investing and financing\nactivities, respectively, and are not included in the non-cash\ninvesting activities presented here. See Note 26 for more\ninformation and balances as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an\nintegral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              109                               \n                                                                \n   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)       \n                                                                \n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND\nACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements as of June 30, 2024 and for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the opinion\nof management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes included within\nCitigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K) and Citigroup\u2019s Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First\nQuarter of 2024 Form 10-Q). Certain financial information that\nis normally included in annual financial statements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has\nbeen condensed or omitted. Management must make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements\nand the related footnote disclosures. While management uses its\nbest judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited. Throughout these Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d\n\u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to Citigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. Certain reclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior periods\u2019 financial statements and\nnotes to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. Cash\nequivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and\ndue from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks .\nCash flows from risk management activities are classified in the\nsame category as the related assets and liabilities. Amounts\nincluded in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks\napproximate fair value.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities\nSubject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual\nSale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in\npractice whereby certain entities included the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it\nclarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an\nequity security should not be considered part of the unit of\naccount of the equity security and, therefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature\nand remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances\nthat could cause a lapse in the restrictions. Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial\nstatements of the Company. Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic\n323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expanded the\nscope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the\nproportional amortization method of accounting. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible\ninvestment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits\nand other income tax benefits that are received by the investor,\nwith the amortization of the investment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in the income statement as\ncomponents of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the\nCompany to elect to use the proportional amortization method to\naccount for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized\ninvestments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU\non January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the\nfinancial statements of the Company. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of 2023 accounting changes.\n                              110                               \nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for and Disclosure of\nCrypto Assets In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08,\nIntangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60):\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to\nimprove the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an\nentity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting\nperiod, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The\namendments also improve the information provided to investors\nabout an entity\u2019s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure\nabout significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and\nchanges during the reporting period. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.\nCiti does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the\nguidance. Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness\nof income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public\nbusiness entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate\nreconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by\nnature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a\n5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax\nrate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include\nstate and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect;\nforeign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws or tax credits;\neffect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances;\nnontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in\nunrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include\nqualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions\nthat contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect\nof the state and local income tax category and explanation of\nthe nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling\nitems. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose\nincome taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by\nfederal, state and foreign taxes and by jurisdiction identified\nbased on the same 5% quantitative threshold. The standard is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\nThe transition method is prospective with the retrospective\nmethod permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the annual\nreporting period beginning on January 1, 2025, and is currently\nevaluating the impact on disclosures. Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures In November\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended\nto improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily\nthrough enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.\nThe ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure\nof segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM,\nan explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of\nsegment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources, and all segments\u2019 profit or\nloss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic\n280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an\ninterim basis. The amendments also clarified that public\nentities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of\na segment\u2019s profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.\nThe ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective basis and\nwill be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December\n31, 2024 and interim periods for the interim period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2025. Citi is currently evaluating the impact of the\nstandard on its disclosure of reportable segments and related\ndisclosures.\n                              111                               \n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,\nSIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND\nOTHER BUSINESS EXITS\n\nSummary of Discontinued\nOperations\n\nCiti\u2019s results from\nDiscontinued operations\nconsisted of residual\nactivities related to the\nsales of the Egg Banking plc\ncredit card business in 2011\nand the German retail banking\nbusiness in 2008. All\nDiscontinued operations\nresults are recorded within\nAll Other .\n\nCiti\u2019s Income (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations, net\nof taxes was $ 0million and $(\n1) million for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023, and $( 1) million and $(\n2) million for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n\nSignificant Disposals\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Citi had\nclosed the sales of\nnineconsumer banking\nbusinesses within All Other\n\u2014Legacy Franchises.

These reallocations and\nreclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other\nresults and prior periods were conformed to reflect these\nchanges. Citi\u2019s consolidated results remain unchanged for all\nperiods presented. Revenues and expenses directly associated\nwith each respective business segment or component are included\nin determining respective operating results. Other revenues and\nexpenses that are attributable to a particular business segment\nor component are generally allocated from All Other based on\nrespective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant\nmeasures. Revenues and expenses from transactions with other\noperating segments or components are treated as transactions\nwith external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, while\nfunding charges paid by operating segments and funding credits\nreceived by Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in\nnet interest income. The Company includes intersegment\neliminations within All Other to reconcile the operating segment\nresults to Citi\u2019s consolidated results.

required\nfunding is expected for 2024.\n(2) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(3) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                              120

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 15.\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer . See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n(3) Amortized cost includes unallocated portfolio layer\ncumulative basis adjustments of $( 0.2) billion as of June 30,\n2024. Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized (losses) on\nmortgage-backed securities excluding the effect of unallocated\nportfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments were $ 75million\nand $( 1.0)

The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.

Corporate loans are\nconsidered past due when principal or interest is contractually\ndue but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which\nare not included in the various delinquency columns and,\ntherefore, the

The following tables\ndetail corporate loan modifications granted during the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty by type of modification\ngranted and the financial effect of those modifications.

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a third-\nparty subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage\nloans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a three-monthperiod during\nwhich the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with their original contractual terms.\nUpon successful completion of the trial period, and the\nborrower\u2019s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the\nborrower enter into a permanent modification.

Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current presentation. See Note 3 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nCiti tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the\nannual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual\ntest if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-\nlikely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were\nidentified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of\nJune 30, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nWhile the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key\nassumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic\nand business environments continue to evolve as management\nexecutes on its transformation and strategy. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to\ndiffer from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill impairment charges in

securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 6billion and $ 6billion\nin unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 245million and $ 282million\nin maximum exposure to loss as of June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\n                              172                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these\ntransactions was $ 6.6billion and $ 8.5billion, respectively\n(see Note 14 and Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured\nby third parties in which the Company holds securities in\ninventory, as these investments are made on arm\u2019s-length terms;\n\u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities\nheld by the Company, which are classified as Trading account\nassets or Investments , in which the Company has no other\ninvolvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be\nsignificant (see Notes 13 and 22 for more information on these\npositions); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the\noriginal mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022\nVIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              173                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citi did not transfer\nnon-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization\nentities during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThese securities are backed by either residential or commercial\nmortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients. As of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi held noretained\ninterests in private label re-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes U.S.\ngovernment-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency)\nsecurities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\nCiti transferred agency securities with a fair value of\napproximately $ 6.3billion and $ 10.7billion to re-\nsecuritization entities, compared to approximately $ 3.3billion\nand $ 8.6billion for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the fair value of Citi-\nretained interests in agency re-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled approximately $ 1.8billion (including\n$ 942million related to re-securitization transactions executed\nin 2024), compared to $ 1.7billion as of December 31, 2023\n(including $ 930million related to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2023), which is recorded in Trading\naccount assets . The original fair values of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in which Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were\napproximately $ 73.1billion and $ 84.1billion, respectively. As\nof June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not\nconsolidate any private label or agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the commercial\npaper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $\n20.1billion and $ 21.1billion of purchased assets outstanding,\nand unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $\n16.3billion and $ 16.7billion, respectively. Substantially all\nof the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term\ncommercial paper. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nweighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were approximately 80and 68days,\nrespectively. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured\nwith transaction-specific credit enhancement, including over-\ncollateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts,\ndirect recourse or third-party guarantees. Credit enhancement is\nsized with the objective of approximating an investment-grade\ncredit rating, based on Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-specific credit enhancement, the\nconduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that\nequal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s assets with a minimum\nof $ 200million to $ 350million. The letters of credit provided\nby the Company to the conduits total approximately $ 2.0billion\nand $ 2.1billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The net result across multi-seller conduits\nadministered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted\nassets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement\ndescribed above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first\nto the Company and then to the commercial paper investors. At\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned $\n9.3billion and $ 10.1billion, respectively, of the commercial\npaper issued by its administered conduits. The Company\u2019s\ninvestments were not driven by market illiquidity and the\nCompany is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits. Municipal Securities\nTender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB\ntrusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the\nCompany. The Company provides other liquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable interest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers that totaled $ 0.7billion and $\n1.2billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit\nare offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out\nprovisions.\n                              178                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below.

All derivatives are\nrecorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note\n24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table\nbelow. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market\nvaluation adjustments that may be required on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n                                                                \n               Hedgi\u2026                                           \n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              180                               \nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s derivative transactions and the related offsetting\namounts as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross\npositive fair values are offset against gross negative fair\nvalues by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in\nrespect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given\ncounterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in\nthe offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the\nCompany\u2019s balance sheet presentation, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians,\nbut which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an\nevent of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              181                               \nDerivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables\n

For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented\nbelow:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n              $  \u2026            $  \u2026           $             $    \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) .

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives Certain\nderivative instruments contain provisions that require the\nCompany to either post additional collateral or immediately\nsettle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of\na specified event related to the credit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are defined by the existing derivative\ncontracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the\nCompany and its affiliates. The fair value (excluding CVA) of\nall derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net liability position at June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 was $ 15billion and $ 15billion,\nrespectively. The Company posted $ 13billion and $ 12billion as\ncollateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as\nof June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of June 30, 2024, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.2billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 14million\nupon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral requirements of approximately $\n0.2billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers\nFor transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the Company has retained substantially\nall of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the\nasset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received\nas of the date of derecognition were $ 6.1billion and $\n4.3billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. At June 30, 2024, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets was $ 5.7billion. The fair value\nof the total return swaps as of June 30, 2024 was $ 89million\nrecorded as gross derivative assets and $ 46million recorded as\ngross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the fair\nvalue of these previously derecognized assets was $ 4.3billion,\nand the fair value of the total return swaps was $ 121million\nrecorded as gross derivative assets and $ 29million recorded as\ngross derivative liabilities. The balances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis, before the application of\ncounterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included\nprimarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in\nthis Note.\n                              189                               \n                                                                \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                                                                \n                              190                               \n23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n26 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nvalue drivers are observable\nin the market. \u2022 Level 3:\nValuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which\none or more significant inputs\nor value drivers are\nunobservable . As required\nunder the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven criteria to\ndetermine whether an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based on the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA) and funding

The\nLevel 3 to Level 2 transfers\nwere primarily the result of\nenhanced significance testing\nof unobservable input for\ncertain structured debt\ninstruments. The Level 2 to\nLevel 3 transfers were\nprimarily the result of\ncertain unobservable inputs\nbecoming more significant to\nthe overall valuation of these\ninstruments.\n\nThe following were the\nsignificant Level 3 transfers\nfor the period December 31,\n2022 to June 30, 2023:\n\n\u2022 During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023,\ntransfers of Long-term debt\nwere $ 2.1billion and $\n3.2billion from Level 2 to\nLevel 3, respectively. Of the\n$ 3.2billion transfer,\napproximately $ 2.9billion\nrelated to interest rate\noption volatility inputs\nbecoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant relative to their\noverall valuation, and $\n0.3billion related to equity\nand credit derivative inputs\n(in addition to other\nvolatility inputs, e.g.,\ninterest rate volatility\ninputs) becoming unobservable\nand/or significant to their\noverall valuation. In other\ninstances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs\nbecoming more observable, and\nsome unobservable inputs\nbecoming less significant to\nthe overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an\noption becomes deep-in or\ndeep-out of the money). This\nhas primarily resulted in $\n1.3billion and $ 6.1billion of\ncertain structured long-term\ndebt products being\ntransferred from Level 3 to\nLevel 2 during the three and\nsix months ended June 30,\n2023, respectively.\n                              204                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The following tables present the valuation\ntechniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the\nmost significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain\nof $ 343million and loss of $( 837) million for the three months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and a loss of $( 407) million and\n$( 1,270) million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes\nin instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by\nincorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable in\nthe bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to\nvalue each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option\nfor Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected\nPortfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell,\nSecurities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest income and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications.

Related interest income is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nincome on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk were zeroand a\nloss of $( 25) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due\nto instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on\nchanges in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery\nassumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals\nCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g.,\ngold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity\ntrading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated\ninto a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument.\nCitigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host\ncontract, and reports the contract within Trading account assets\non the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. As part of its\ncommodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious\nmetals investments and executes forward purchase and forward\nsale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi\nsells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s\nreceivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.

as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n128billion and $ 138billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n(3) Includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\nunder the sponsored member repo program.\n                              215                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse In addition to the amounts presented in\nthe tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $\n12million and $ 11million at June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Futures and Over-\nthe-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services\non central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and\nremitted in this manner was approximately $ 16.1billion and $\n17.8billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts\nof the liabilities related to the guarantees and\nindemnifications included in the tables above amounted to\napproximately $ 1.0billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively. The\ncarrying value of financial and performance guarantees is\nincluded in Other liabilities . For loans sold with recourse,\nthe carrying value of the liability is included in Other\nliabilities . Collateral Cash collateral available to Citi to\nreimburse losses realized under these guarantees and\nindemnifications amounted to $ 50.4billion and $ 52.5billion at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities\nand other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $\n71.2billion and $ 67.7billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 3.0billion and $\n3.1billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOther property may also be available to Citi to cover losses\nunder certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the\nvalue of such property has not been determined.\n\nPerformance Risk\nPresented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts\nof future payments that are classified based on internal and\nexternal credit ratings. The determination of the maximum\npotential future payments is based on the notional amount of the\nguarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged.

Such fees (net of certain\ndirect costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the commitment period.\nThe table below summarizes Citigroup\u2019s credit commitments:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0                                                           \n  milli\u2026                     Outsi\u2026          June       Decem\u2026  \n  of\u00a0                            of           30,          31,  \n  dolla\u2026          U.S.       U.S.(\u2026          2024         2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  simil\u2026    $      674    $   3,741    $    4,415    $   5,345  \n  lette\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  credit                                                        \n  One-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026           607          580         1,187        1,245  \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026                                                        \n  Revol\u2026                                                        \n  open-\u2026                                                        \n  loans                                                         \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  by             5,332           19         5,351        5,495  \n  one-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026                                                        \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  prope\u2026                                                        \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  real                                                          \n  estat\u2026                                                        \n  const\u2026        11,673        1,638        13,311       15,266  \n  and                                                           \n  land                                                          \n  devel\u2026                                                        \n  Credit                                                        \n  card         617,155       61,474       678,629       677,0\u2026  \n  lines                                                         \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  other        215,894       106,8\u2026       322,746       312,3\u2026  \n  consu\u2026                                                        \n  loan                                                          \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n  Other                                                         \n  commi\u2026         4,942          135         5,077        5,146  \n  and                                                           \n  conti\u2026                                                        \n  Total     $  856,277    $  174,4\u2026    $  1,030,\u2026    $  1,021\u2026  \n                                                                \n(1) Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries\nunder sales agreements are reflected in their original\ncategories until the respective sales are completed.\n(2) Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nOther Commitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank.

LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment. These leases may\ncontain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination\nfeatures; however, these\noptions do not impact the\nlease term unless the Company\nis reasonably certain that it\nwill exercise options. These\nleases have a weighted-average\nremaining lease term of\napproximately six yearsas of\nJune 30, 2024.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s leases, see\nNotes 1 and 29 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.\nThe following table presents\ninformation on the right-of-\nuse (ROU) asset and lease\nliabilities included in\nPremises and equipment and\nOther liabilities ,\nrespectively:\n                                                            \n                               June 30,       December 31,  \n  In millions of dollars           2024               2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  ROU asset                 $     2,785    $         2,801  \n  Lease liability                 2,959              2,974  \n                                                            \nThe Company recognizes fixed\nlease costs on a straight-line\nbasis throughout the lease\nterm in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nThe following information supplements and amends, as applicable,\nthe disclosure in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of Citigroup\u2019s First Quarter of 2024 Form 10-Q and in\nNote 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates\nand subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup\nand Related Parties. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup\nestablishes accruals for contingencies, including any\nlitigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when\nCitigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once\nestablished, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as\nappropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be\nsubstantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those\nmatters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies\nfor which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition\nare resolved. If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because\nthe matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth\nabove), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each\ncase assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not\nprobable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such\nmatters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be\nmade. At June 30, 2024, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably\npossible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.2billion in the aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to\nestimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change.\nIn addition, while many estimates presented in financial\nstatements and other financial disclosures involve significant\njudgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from\nlitigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an\nestimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete\ninformation about the facts underlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future rulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives\nof adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to\nbe wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often\nnot amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate. Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of\nCitigroup\u2019s management, based on current knowledge and after\ntaking into account its current accruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all\n\nmatters described in this Note would not be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition\nof Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or\nindeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the\ninherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters could, from time to time, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s consolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup\u2019s\naccounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including\nfor any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.

On June 20, 2024, the German BaFin announced a\nresolution with Citigroup Global Markets Europe (CGME) for \u20ac\n12.97million. Several European regulatory agencies are\ncontinuing to conduct investigations or make inquiries. CGML and\nCGME are cooperating with these investigations and inquiries.\nForeign Exchange Matters On May 16, 2024, in NYPL v.
