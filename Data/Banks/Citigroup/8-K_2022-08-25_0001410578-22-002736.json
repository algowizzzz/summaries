Current Report on Form 8-K Item 8.01. Other\nEvents. As part of the previously announced intent of Citigroup\nInc. (Citi) to exit its consumer franchises in 14 markets in\nAsia, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Mexico, as well as its\ncontinued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in\nRussia, Citi has decided to wind down its consumer banking and\nlocal commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the\nwind-down, Citi will also continue to actively pursue sales of\ncertain Russian consumer banking portfolios. Actions to\nfacilitate the wind-down are expected to commence this quarter.\nThe wind-down is expected to affect approximately 2,300\nemployees and 15 branches. Consumer products and channels\naffected by the wind-down include deposits, investments, loans\nand cards. In connection with the wind-down plan, Citi expects\nto incur approximately $170 million in costs, primarily over the\nnext 18 months, largely driven by restructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other related charges. Certain statements\nin this report are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations\nand are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future results or\noccurrences. Actual results and capital and other financial\ncondition may differ materially from those included in these\nstatements due to a variety of factors, including, among others,\nCiti\u2019s ability to successfully wind down its consumer banking\nand local commercial banking operations in Russia, including\nwithin the expected timeframe, whether resulting from or related\nto Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine or otherwise, including imposition of\nadditional sanctions and export controls, as well as the broader\nimpacts to financial markets and the macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical environments; governmental or regulatory\nrequirements, approvals and actions; Citi\u2019s incurrence of\nunexpected losses, charges or other costs in connection with the\nwind down; and the precautionary statements included in this\nreport. These factors also consist of those contained in Citi\u2019s\nfilings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding without limitation the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of\nCiti\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2021 and Citi\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 10,\n2022 (as amended by a Current Report on Form 8-K/A dated May 10,\n2022). Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of\nCiti speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not\nundertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the\nimpact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the\nforward-looking statements were made.
