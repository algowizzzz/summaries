This year\u2019s Annual Meeting will be held in a\nvirtual format through a live webcast to facilitate\nstockholder attendance regardless\nof location and reduce the carbon footprint of\nCiti\u2019s activities. Details relating to the Annual\nMeeting logistics are provided\nin this 2025 Proxy Statement and at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CITI2025.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on a\nnumber of important matters. Please take the time to\ncarefully read each of the proposals\ndescribed in the Proxy Statement.\n\nThank you for your support of Citi.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn C. Dugan\n\nChair of the Board\n\nTable of Contents\n     \n  4  \n     \n2025 Board Letter to Stockholders\n\nCiti made substantial progress in 2024 toward achieving\nkey strategic goals.\n\nOne such goal is organizational simplification. Citi\ndelivered on its announced plan to refocus the firm around five\ninterconnected businesses \u2013 Services, Markets, Banking,\nWealth,and U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) \u2013 the heads of which now\nreport directly to the CEO. This powerfully simple\norganizational\nstructure has significantly improved transparency and\naccountability for each of these businesses, not just to our\nCEO, but also to the\nBoard and to you, our stockholders. In addition, the\nreorganization eliminated regional structures and unnecessary\nlayers of management,\nresulting in a new, flatter management model. This is helping to\nmake Citi a simpler, better controlled firm that can operate\nfaster,\nimprove client service, and unlock shareholder value.\n\nAnother strategic goal is business simplification. Here\nthe firm continued to execute its plan to exit consumer banking\nbusinesses in 14 markets outside the United States. Citi has now\nclosed\nsales in nine of those markets, and the wind-downs of its\nconsumer businesses in China and South Korea, and of its overall\npresence in\nRussia, are nearly complete. In addition, the firm is currently\nin the midst of the sales process for its consumer business in\nPoland.\nMost notably, at the end of 2024, Citi successfully separated\nits consumer, small, and middle-market banking businesses in\nMexico (Banamex)\nfrom the firm\u2019s institutional business \u2013 a significant\nundertaking and critical accomplishment toward executing an\ninitial\npublic offering of Banamex stock.\n\nThe firm also embarked on a number of important initiatives\nin 2024 to significantly grow its businesses. For example, Citi\nand American Airlines announced the extension and expansion of\ntheir long-standing\npartnership, with Citi becoming the exclusive issuer of the\nAAdvantage co-branded card portfolio, beginning in 2026; this\nwill facilitate\nsignificant growth of Citi\u2019s Branded Cards business in the years\nahead. Another example is the exclusive agreement that Citi and\nApollo Global Management Inc. entered into to form a landmark\n$25 billion private credit, direct lending program. This program\nwill significantly\nenhance access for Citi\u2019s corporate financial sponsor clients to\nthe large private lending capital pool.\n\nOn the key strategic goal of transformation of Citi\u2019s\nrisk management and controls, the firm also made progress, but\nnot as much as intended. As a result, in July 2024, the Federal\nReserve\nBoard and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency took further\nregulatory actions in connection with the 2020 Consent Orders.\nCiti\u2019s\nmanagement has acknowledged that, despite making important\nprogress in advancing some areas of the transformation, there\nwere other areas\nwhere Citi did not make enough progress, such as in its data\nquality management and related governance and regulatory\nreporting. This\nis reflected in the lower payout of the final tranche of the\nTransformation Bonus Program, as detailed later in the proxy,\nconsistent\nwith the Board\u2019s responsibility to hold management accountable\nfor its performance. Citi\u2019s Board, acting through its\nTransformation\nOversight Committee, is intently focused on overseeing\nmanagement\u2019s achievement of significantly improved progress on\nthe transformation\nin 2025 and beyond.\n\nOverall, Citi\u2019s progress on its strategic goals\ncontributed to the firm\u2019s much improved financial performance in\n2024. Each of the firm\u2019s five businesses reported year-over-year\nincreases in revenues. The firm, as well as each of the five\nbusinesses, achieved positive operating leverage for the full\nyear. Citi\u2019s\n2024 net income was up approximately 40 percent; revenues\n(excluding divestitures) were up 5 percent; tangible book\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n     \n  5  \n     \nvalue per share was\nup 4 percent; and Citi returned $6.7 billion to stockholders\nthrough dividends and stock repurchases. In addition, the key\nmetric for\nstockholders of Total Shareholder Return increased by 42 percent\nin 2024.\n\nWhile Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) also\nimproved in 2024 \u2013 by approximately 210 basis points to 7\npercent \u2013 management announced that, due to a necessary\nincrease in firm investments, its target RoTCE for 2026 is now\nbetween 10 and 11 percent, somewhat lower than Citi\u2019s previous\ntarget. The Board believes that this is a realistic reduction,\nand also strongly agrees with management\u2019s assertion that the\n2026 RoTCE target is a waypoint, not a destination. Management\u2019s\nfocus is on improving returns well above that level, and to\nhold themselves accountable for doing so. Your Board will hold\nmanagement accountable for this as well.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of Citi. Dialogue with\nstockholders is a fundamental feature of a well-governed\norganization, and we will continue to make it a priority. Please\nwrite with any concerns or suggestions to: Citigroup Inc.

The following supplements that discussion\nby summarizing the principal executive compensation decisions we\nmade for 2024. As used throughout this Proxy Statement, Tangible\nBook Value per Share (TBVPS), Return on Tangible Common Equity\n(RoTCE) and Revenues Excluding Divestitures are each non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. See Annex A for a reconciliation of those\nnon-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP\nfinancial measures. As used throughout this Proxy Statement, the\nterms Operating Leverage, Book Value per Share, Diluted EPS,\nReturn on Assets, Total Payout Ratio, Income from Continuing\nOperations Before Taxes, Return on Common Equity, Average\nTangible Common Equity, RoTCE, Revenues Excluding Divestitures\nand TBVPS have the meanings assigned to them in Annex A. CEO\nCompensation The Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee (Compensation Committee) set Ms. Fraser\u2019s\ntotal compensation for 2024 at $34.5 million, consisting of a\nbase salary of $1.5 million and an incentive award of $33\nmillion. In setting the amount of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive award,\nthe Compensation Committee considered the strength of Ms.\nFraser\u2019s strategic vision, Citi\u2019s 2024 operational efforts and\nresults, Ms. Fraser\u2019s exemplary leadership, absolute and\nrelative total stockholder returns (TSR), and an analysis of\ncompetitive market levels of pay for CEOs of peer companies. As\nCiti\u2019s CEO since early 2021, Ms. Fraser has taken bold steps to\nimprove Citi \u2014 fixing a complicated risk-taking organization\nwith a truly global presence and running the organization\ndifferently than it has been run in the past. Her leadership is\nstrong, stable and transparent as the firm addresses many\nchallenges and adjusts to significant changes in an intensely\ncompetitive environment. The full Board of Directors recognizes\nthe high degree of difficulty of the task and the specific and\ntangible positive change in multiple aspects of the organization\nthat have resulted from Ms. Fraser\u2019s efforts, and the\nCompensation Committee reflected this view in its pay decision.\nFinancial Performance Citi delivered strong financial\nperformance in 2024, demonstrating that our strategy is\ndelivering overall improved financial performance. Each of\nCiti\u2019s five businesses \u2014 Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth and\nU.S. Personal Banking (USPB)\u2014 reported year-over-year increases\nin revenues in 2024. The firm, as well as each of the five\nbusinesses, also achieved positive Operating Leverage for the\nfull year. The firm\u2019s 2024 net income was up 37%, revenues were\nup 3% (5% excluding divestitures), tangible book value per share\nwas up 4% and RoTCE was up 210 basis points, in each case from\n2023. Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital Ratio was up to 13.6%. Citi also\nreturned $6.7 billion to common stockholders in 2024 through\ndividends and stock repurchases. Risk and Control Citi made\nsteady and meaningful progress in remediating the issues\naddressed in the Consent Orders (as defined on page 30) with the\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC), most notably in risk management,\nmodernization and resiliency. However, as we have stated before,\nthis is a multiyear endeavor. It requires that we address\ndecades of underinvestment in Citi\u2019s infrastructure, which has a\ndirect impact on data quality. Of course, transformation efforts\nof this scale involve significant complexities and uncertainties\nand results are not linear.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  14  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources and    \n      Management Highlights                                     \n                                                                \nIn 2024, the firm did not make as much progress as intended, and\nthe FRB and OCC entered into Civil Money Penalty Consent Orders\nwith Citi and Citibank, N.A. (CBNA) in the amounts of\napproximately $61 million and $75 million, respectively, related\nto the Consent Orders (collectively the Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Orders). In addition, the OCC and CBNA entered into an\namendment to the OCC Consent Order (as defined on page 30) that\nincludes a requirement that Citi formalize a process to\ndetermine whether sufficient resources are being appropriately\nallocated toward achieving timely and sustainable compliance\nwith the OCC\u2019s Consent Order. In response, Citi has made changes\nto the governance and structure of its data program and has\nincreased the level of investment in the program. On balance,\nand taking into account the Civil Money Penalty Consent Orders,\nthe Compensation Committee recognized that overall the\norganization has made substantial progress in our transformation\nunder Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership. Most notably, Ms. Fraser has\nestablished a new leadership structure to increase\naccountability and enable the completion of regulatory and other\naspects of our transformation work. Ms. Fraser has focused\nappropriately on retaining strategic decision makers and\nproviding them with the resources needed to execute our plans,\nas well as dedicating appropriate direct personal attention to\nthe effort and involvement in solving our most pressing\nchallenges. Leadership and Talent Our ability to recruit\nindustry leaders to the firm and to retain our own talent\ndepends on our ability to convincingly communicate a vision for\nour organization and the opportunity for success in the near\nterm. Our recent successes in recruitment and retention are\nattributable in significant part to Ms. Fraser\u2019s having\ncommunicated such a vision. We summarize the evolution of our\nleadership team during Ms. Fraser\u2019s tenure on page 70.\nOrganizational Simplification \u2013 Our Business Citi has\nsignificantly advanced our strategic goal of organizational\nsimplification as presented at our 2022 Investor Day. One part\nof that initiative involved refocusing our firm around five\ninterconnected businesses \u2014 Services, Markets, Banking,\nWealthand USPB\u2014 each with a clear path to accelerating growth,\ngaining share and increasing returns. Additionally, since\nannouncing our intention to exit consumer banking across 14\nmarkets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico as part of\nour strategic refresh, we closed sales in nine of those markets,\nand the wind-downs of Citi\u2019s consumer businesses in China and\nKorea and overall presence in Russia are nearly complete. Most\nnotably, at the end of 2024 we successfully separated our\nconsumer, small and middle-market banking businesses in Mexico\n(Banamex) from our institutional business, a significant\nundertaking and critical accomplishment in our path to executing\nan initial public offering of Banamex stock. We are currently in\nthe midst of the sales process for our consumer business in\nPoland. Organizational Simplification \u2013 Our Operating Model A\nsecond part of our organizational simplification initiative\ninvolved rethinking our operating model to better align with our\ntarget business mix. During 2024 we finalized a new, flatter\nmanagement model, eliminating layers and regional structures,\nand enhancing leadership accountability in each of our\ninterconnected businesses to help make Citi a simpler, better-\ncontrolled firm that can operate faster, improve client service\nand unlock value for stockholders. Conclusion Under Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nleadership Citi has formulated a strong strategic direction,\ndemonstrated its significant financial and operational\nachievements, including progress concerning the Consent Orders\ndespite the Civil Money Penalty Consent Orders, simplified and\nrestructured the overall business platform, and registered\nimportant accomplishments in attracting and retaining the talent\nneeded to continue these successes. As in 2023, Ms. Fraser\u2019s\nincentive compensation for 2024 was delivered in three parts.\nFirst, 35% was delivered in the form of deferred Citi common\nstock awards. Second, 15% was paid in cash at the beginning of\n2025. Third, the remaining 50% of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive\ncompensation was delivered in the form of Performance Share\nUnits (PSUs). Overall, 85% of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive\ncompensation was equity-based, and 59% of the equity-based\ncompensation was delivered in the form of PSUs to align Ms.\nFraser\u2019s compensation with the creation of long-term stockholder\nvalue.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                          \n  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources  15  \n  and Management Highlights                               \n                                                          \nOther Executive Compensation Transformation Bonus Program To\nincentivize effective execution in connection with the Consent\nOrder programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s risk and control\nenvironment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation\nCommittee approved a transformation bonus program\n(Transformation Bonus Program). A description of the\nTransformation Bonus Program was included in our 2022 Proxy\nStatement. Additional information related to the Transformation\nBonus Program can be found in the supplemental solicitation\nmaterials Citi filed with the SEC in 2022 (which can be accessed\nat www.citigroup.com). Ms. Fraser has not been eligible to\nparticipate in the Transformation Bonus Program. As discussed on\npage 14, in July 2024 the FRB and OCC took further regulatory\nactions in connection with the Consent Orders. Citi has\nacknowledged that, despite making good progress in simplifying\nour firm and remediating the Consent Orders, there were areas\nwhere we have not made progress quickly enough, such as in our\ndata quality management related to governance and regulatory\nreporting. These areas impacted the award metrics and thus had\nan impact on the payout of tranche 3 of the Transformation Bonus\nProgram. Following the completion of the third and final\nperformance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus\nProgram, the Compensation Committee determined that the payout\nfor the period ending on December 31, 2024 would be down,\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s fourth quarter 2024 earnings call and\n2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and set the Performance\nAchievement Percentage at 53%. The terms and conditions of the\nTransformation Bonus Program were not changed for 2024. In\napproving the Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation\nCommittee did not intend that it would be a replacement,\nsubstitution or make-up for any other compensation amount, nor\ndoes the Compensation Committee expect to make other special\nawards related to our transformation efforts in the future. For\nfurther information concerning the Transformation Bonus Program\nsee pages 89 to 91. Performance Share Units As described on page\n88, the Compensation Committee determined that 66.4% of the\ntarget number of shares subject to PSUs granted as part of our\n2021 incentive compensation awards were earned for the three-\nyear performance period from 2022 through 2024. Cumulative TSR\nfor the performance period was 12.5%. The resulting payout value\nwas equal to 78.9% of initial value, reflecting the impact of\nboth financial performance and TSR, as compared to a 93% payout\nfor the prior three-year performance period, from 2021 through\n2023, related to 2020 incentive compensation awards. Citi\ndelivers a portion of incentive compensation for our Executive\nManagement Team (EMT) in the form of PSUs. For 2024, we expanded\nthe use of PSUs in our compensation program by extending the use\nof PSUs to Citi Operating Team members. Formed during 2023, that\nteam includes the EMT and, as of December 31, 2024, an\nadditional 11 executives. Human Capital Resources and Management\nCiti strives to deliver to its full potential by focusing on its\nstrategic priority of attracting and retaining highly qualified\nand motivated employees. Citi\u2019s vision remains \u2014 to be the\npreeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border\nneeds, a global leader in wealth management and a valued\npersonal bank in the U.S. Citi is structured around five core\ninterconnected businesses\u2014 Services, Markets, Banking, Wealthand\nUSPB, a centralized client organization to strengthen how Citi\ndelivers for clients across the Company and an international\nunit to oversee the local delivery of the Company\u2019s services and\nproducts to clients in each of the markets where Citi has an on-\nthe-ground presence to serve and support large and mid-sized\ncompanies.

Driving a Culture of Excellence and Accountability\nCiti\u2019s talent and culture initiatives focus on fostering a\nculture of excellence and accountability that is supported by\nstrong risk and controls management. Citi\u2019s Leadership\nPrinciples of \u201ctaking ownership, delivering with pride and\nsucceeding together\u201d (Leadership Principles) have been\nreinforced through a behavioral science-led campaign, Citi\u2019s New\nWay, which reinforces the key working habits that support Citi\u2019s\nleadership culture. Citi\u2019s performance management approach\nemphasizes the Leadership Principles through a four-pillar\nsystem, evaluating what employees deliver against financial,\nrisk and controls, and client and franchise goals, as well as\nhow employees deliver from a leadership perspective. The\nperformance management and incentive compensation processes,\npolicies and frameworks promote accountability and consistency,\nin particular for risk and controls. Citi\u2019s culture initiatives\nare also supported by changes in the way Citi identifies,\nassesses, develops and promotes talent, particularly at the most\nsenior levels of the organization.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                          \n  Executive Compensation and Human Capital Resources  17  \n  and Management Highlights                               \n                                                          \nWorkforce Development Citi\u2019s numerous programmatic offerings aim\nto reinforce its culture and values, foster understanding of\ncompliance requirements and develop competencies required to\ndeliver excellence to its clients.

In 2023,                               \n  \u00b7  Citi launched a \u201cDevelopment 365\u201d campaign that drove      \n     significant increases in the number of employees across    \n     Citi who had                                               \n     developmental plans and conversations with their           \n     managers.                                                  \n                                                                \nPay Transparency and Pay Equity Citi has continued its effort to\nsupport its global workforce, including taking actions with\nrespect to pay equity. Citi values pay transparency and has\ntaken significant action to provide managers and other employees\nwith greater clarity about Citi\u2019s compensation philosophy. Citi\nhas introduced market-based salary structures and bonus\nopportunity guidelines in various countries worldwide, and posts\nsalary ranges on all external U.S. job postings, which align\nwith strategic objectives of pay equity and transparency. In\naddition, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay\nequity within the organization. In 2018, Citi was the first\nmajor U.S. financial institution to publicly release the results\nof a pay equity review comparing its compensation of women to\nthat of men, as well as U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities.\nSince 2018, Citi has continued to be transparent about pay\nequity, including disclosing its unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for\nboth women and U.S. minorities. The raw pay gap measures the\ndifference in median compensation, which is affected by\nrepresentation of women and U.S. minorities in senior and\nhigher-paying roles. The adjusted pay gap is a true measure of\npay equity, or \u201clike for like,\u201d that compares the compensation\nof women to men and U.S. minorities to non-minorities when\nadjusting for factors such as job function, title/level and\ngeography. Citi\u2019s annual pay equity analysis for 2024 determined\nthat on an adjusted basis global gender and U.S. racial pay gaps\nare in each case less than 1%. The raw pay gap analysis\ndetermined that the median pay for women globally is 79% of the\nmedian for men globally and the median pay for U.S. minorities\nis 100% of the median for U.S. non-minorities. Benefits and\nWell-being Citi is proud to provide a wide range of benefits\nthat support its employees\u2019 mental, social, physical and\nfinancial well-being through various life stages and events.\nSuch benefits contribute to Citi\u2019s ability to attract, engage\nand retain employees.

The\nGuidelines are reviewed at least annually, and revised as\nnecessary, to continue\nto reflect best practices. The full text of the Guidelines, as\napproved by the Board, is set forth on Citi\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com.\nClick on \u201cInvestors,\u201d then \u201cCorporate Governance,\u201d and then\n\u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines.\u201d The\nGuidelines outline the responsibilities, operations,\nqualifications, and composition of the Board. The following\nsummarizes certain provisions\nof the Guidelines.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nOur goal is that at least two-thirds of the members of the Board\nbe independent. Descriptions of our independence criteria and\nthe results\nof the Board\u2019s independence determinations are set forth below.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nThe Guidelines require that all\nmembers of the following committees of the Board be independent:\nAudit; Compensation, Performance Management and Culture; and\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs.

Members of the Audit Committee may not serve on more than\nthree public company audit committees, including Citi\u2019s Audit\nCommittee.\nThe number of other for-profit public and non-public company\nboards and not-for-profit boards on which a Director may serve,\nincluding\nleadership positions on such for-profit and not-for-profit\nboards, is subject to review and approval by the Nomination,\nGovernance and\nPublic Affairs Committee, in order to ensure that each Director\nis able to devote sufficient time to performing his or her\nduties as a\nDirector.

In addition to the annual review,\nif a director\nis considering joining a for-profit board, the Director must\nadvise the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee,\nwhich will\nconsider whether, after joining such board and any of its\ncommittees, as well as assuming any leadership positions, the\nDirector can continue\nto devote sufficient time to performing his or her duties as a\nDirector of Citi. In addition, under the Corporate Governance\nGuidelines,\nBoard members are required to disclose significant changes in\nprofessional responsibilities, including assuming a significant\nrole in\na not-for-profit entity, to the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee for consideration.\n\nNo Board nominee serves on more than four for-profit public\ncompany boards, and no Audit Committee member serves on more\nthan three public\ncompany audit committees.

New Directors are provided with an\norientation program\nto familiarize them with Citi\u2019s businesses and functions, as\nwell as its legal, compliance, regulatory, and risk profile.\nCiti provides\neducational sessions on a variety of topics throughout the year\nfor all members of the Board. These sessions are designed to\nallow Directors\nto develop a deeper understanding of, for example, each of\nCiti\u2019s five lines of business.\n\nSuccession Planning\n\nThe Board reviews the Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee\u2019s report on the performance of senior\nexecutives\nto evaluate whether they are providing the highest quality\nleadership for Citi. The Board also works with the Nomination,\nGovernance and\nPublic Affairs Committee to evaluate potential successors to the\nCEO. With respect to regular succession of the CEO and senior\nmanagement,\nCiti\u2019s Board evaluates internal, and, when appropriate, external\ncandidates. To find external candidates, Citi seeks input from\nthe members of the Board, senior management, and recruiting\nfirms. To develop internal candidates, Citi engages in a number\nof practices,\nformal and informal, designed to familiarize the Board with\nCiti\u2019s talent pool. The formal process involves an annual talent\nreview\nconducted by senior management at which the Board studies the\nmost promising members of senior management. The Board learns\nabout each\nperson\u2019s experience, skills, areas of expertise,\naccomplishments, and goals. This review is conducted at a\nregularly scheduled Board\nmeeting on an annual basis. In addition, members of senior\nmanagement are periodically asked to make presentations to the\nBoard at Board\nmeetings and Board strategy sessions. These presentations are\nmade by senior managers of the various business units as well as\nthose who\nserve in corporate functions. The purpose of the formal review\nand other interaction is to familiarize Board members with the\ntalent pool\ninside and outside Citi from which the Board would be able to\nchoose successors to the CEO and evaluate succession for other\nsenior managers\nas necessary from time to time.\n\nCharitable Contributions\n\nIf a Director, or an immediate family member who shares the\nDirector\u2019s household, serves as a director, trustee, or\nexecutive officer\nof a foundation, university, or other not-for-profit\norganization, and such entity receives contributions from Citi\nand/or the Citi Foundation,\nsuch contributions must be reported to the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee at least annually.\n\nInsider Investments and Transactions\n\nMembers of Citi\u2019s Board of Directors and Citi\u2019s executive\nofficers (i.e., Section 16 Insiders) are not permitted to hedge\ntheir Citi securities or to pledge their Citi securities as\ncollateral for a loan. The Guidelines restrict certain financial\ntransactions between Citi and its subsidiaries on the one hand\nand Directors, senior management, and their immediate family\nmembers on the other. Personal loans from Citi or its\nsubsidiaries to Citi\u2019s Directors and its most senior executives,\nor immediate family members who share any such person\u2019s\nhousehold, are prohibited, except for margin loans to employees\nof a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi, mortgage loans, home\nequity loans, consumer loans, credit cards, and overdraft\nchecking privileges, all made on market terms in the ordinary\ncourse of business. See Certain Transactions and Relationships,\nCompensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider Participationon\npages 37-39.\n\nThe Guidelines prohibit investments or transactions by Citi or\nits executive officers and those immediate family members who\nshare an\nexecutive officer\u2019s household in a partnership or other\nprivately held entity in which an outside Director is a\nprincipal, or in\na publicly traded company in which an outside Director owns or\ncontrols more than a 10% interest. Directors and those immediate\nfamily\nmembers who share the Director\u2019s household are not permitted to\nreceive initial public offering allocations. Directors and their\nimmediate family members may participate in Citi-sponsored\ninvestment activities, provided they are offered on the same\nterms as those\noffered to similarly situated non-affiliated persons. Under\ncertain circumstances, or with the approval of the appropriate\ncommittee, members of senior management may participate\nin certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities. Finally,\nthere is a prohibition on certain investments by Directors and\nexecutive\nofficers in third-party entities when the opportunity comes\nsolely as a result of their position with Citi.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  24  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nDirector Independence\n\nThe Board has adopted categorical standards to assist the Board\nin evaluating the independence of each of its Directors. The\ncategorical\nstandards, which are set forth below, describe various types of\nrelationships that could potentially exist between a Director or\nan immediate\nfamily member of a Director and Citi, and set thresholds at\nwhich such relationships would be deemed to be material.\nProvided that no\nrelationship or transaction exists that would disqualify a\nDirector under the categorical standards and no other\nrelationships or transactions\nexist of a type not specifically mentioned in the categorical\nstandards that, in the Board\u2019s opinion, taking into account all\nfacts\nand circumstances, would impair a Director\u2019s ability to exercise\nhis or her independent judgment, the Board, based on the\nrecommendation\nof the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, will\ndeem such person to be independent.\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee reviewed certain information obtained\nfrom Directors\u2019 responses to a questionnaire asking about their\nrelationships with Citi, and those of their immediate family\nmembers and primary business or charitable affiliations and\nother\npotential conflicts of interest, as well as certain data\ncollected by Citi\u2019s businesses related to transactions,\nrelationships, or arrangements between Citi on the one hand and\na Director, immediate family member of a Director, or a primary\nbusiness or charitable affiliation of a Director, on the other.\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also\nreviewed certain relationships or transactions between the\nDirectors or immediate family members of the Directors or their\nprimary\nbusiness or charitable affiliations and Citi and determined that\nthe relationships or transactions complied with the Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines and the related categorical standards. The\nBoard, based on the recommendation of the Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs Committee, determined that, applying the\nGuidelines and standards, which are intended to comply with the\nNYSE\ncorporate governance rules, and all other applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations, each of the below\nDirector nominees standing for re-election is independent. The\nBoard also determined that Barbara J. Desoer and S. Leslie\nIreland are independent.\n                                                    \n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ellen   \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peter                           \n  M.

Citi\u2019s standing\nBoard Committees met as follows: the Audit Committee met 18\ntimes,\nthe Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee\nmet 15 times, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee met\n7 times, the Risk Management Committee met 16 times, and the\nTechnology Committee met 11 times. The Executive Committee did\nnot meet in\n2024.\n\nDuring 2024, independent members of the Board served on and/or\nchaired one or more ad hoc committees, including the\nTransformation Oversight\nCommittee, or served on an international subsidiary board. In\naddition, Mses. Costello, Dailey, Fraser, Ireland, and Taylor\nand Messrs.\nHennes and Turley served on the Board of Directors of Citibank,\nN.A., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Citi.\n\nEach incumbent Director attended at least 75% of the meetings of\nthe Board and of the standing committees of which he or she was\na member\nduring 2024.\n\nMeetings of Non-Management Directors\n\nCiti\u2019s non-management Directors meet in executive session\nwithout any management Directors in attendance whenever the full\nBoard\nconvenes for a regularly scheduled meeting. During 2024, Mr.\nDugan presided at each executive session of the non-management\nDirectors.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nCiti currently has an independent Chair separate from the CEO, a\nstructure that has been in place since 2009. The Board believes\nit is important to maintain flexibility in its Board leadership\nstructure and has had in place different leadership structures\nin the past, depending on the Company\u2019s needs at the time, but\nfirmly supports having an independent Director in a Board\nleadership position at all times. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s Board, on\nDecember 15, 2009, adopted a By-Law amendment that provides that\nif Citi does not have an Independent Chair, the Board will elect\na lead independent Director having similar duties to an\nindependent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of\nthe non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Chair\nprovides independent leadership of the Board.Having an\nindependent Chair or Lead Director enables non-management\nDirectors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration\nwithout immediately involving management. The Chair or Lead\nDirector also serves as a liaison between the Board and senior\nmanagement and regularly meets with Citi\u2019s stockholders,\nstakeholders, and regulators on behalf of the Company. Citi\u2019s\nBoard has determined that the current structure, an independent\nChair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure\nat this time, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be\nan independent Director in a Board leadership position. The\nBoard believes its approach to risk oversight, which includes:\n(i) a report at every regular Board meeting from the Chief Risk\nOfficer on significant risk matters for discussion with the\nBoard, (ii) a standing Risk Management Committee of the Board,\nand (iii) a direct reporting line of the Chief Risk Officer to\nthe Risk Management Committee, that enables the Board to choose\nmany leadership structures without experiencing a material\nimpact on its oversight of risk.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  28  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nBoard Composition\n\nIncluded in the qualifications for Directors listed in the\nCompany\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines is \u201cwhether the\ncandidate\nhas special skills, expertise and background that would\ncomplement the attributes of the existing Directors, taking into\nconsideration\nthe diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\u201d\nCiti\u2019s Board is committed to building a Board that is composed\nof individuals whose backgrounds represent our employees,\ncustomers, and stakeholders. In addition, Citi\u2019s Board provides\na\nvariety of perspectives, personal and professional experiences,\nand backgrounds, as well as other characteristics, such as\nglobal and\ninternational business experience.\n\nDirector Education Program\n\nCiti has a robust Director Education\nProgram that begins with an orientation for newly appointed\nDirectors, providing two days of in-depth training covering all\naspects of\nour business, including, among other things, coverage of Citi\u2019s\norganizational model, including the following five business\nlines:\n(1) Services, (2) Markets, (3) Banking, (4) Wealth, and (5)\nUSPB.

(Citibank). There is\nalso a continuing education program, which includes\npresentations focusing\non industry, regulatory and governance topics and presentations\nfrom the various lines of our business on emerging issues or\nstrategic\ninitiatives to provide our Directors with the opportunity to\nexpand their insight into Citi\u2019s business operations and\nactivities.\nDirectors also have access to external programming and seminars\nto supplement their Citi-provided education. In 2024, the\nDirectors received\ntraining on various topics, including Environmental and\nSustainability matters, U.S. Consumer Credit, Political\nContributions, Net Zero,\nGenerative Artificial Intelliegence, Cybersecurity, Electronic\nCommunications, Regulation O, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair\nLending\nand Treating Customers Fairly, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money\nLaundering, Cluster Updates from the U.K., Europe, and Latin\nAmerica, and\nbusiness updates from Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth, and\nUSPB among other topics.

The ERM Framework also provides clarity on risk\nmanagement roles and responsibilities of the Citigroup Board of\nDirectors,\nCiti\u2019s EMT and employees across the lines of defense. Citi\u2019s\nculture and values drive a strong risk and control environment,\nand are at the heart of the ERM Framework, underpinning the way\nCiti conducts business. The activities that Citi engages in, and\nthe risks\nthose activities generate, must be consistent with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition and the key principles that guide\nit, as\nwell as Citi\u2019s risk appetite.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  30  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nThe Citi Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of risk\nmanagement and holds the EMT accountable for implementing the\nERM Framework\nand managing risk within the defined risk appetite as it meets\nits strategic objectives. The Board\u2019s Transformation Oversight\nCommittee\noversees management\u2019s progress as it relates to the broader\ntransformation of Citi and management\u2019s remediation of issues\nidentified under the Consent Order, dated October 7, 2020,\nentered into by Citi with the FRB (FRB Consent Order), including\nissues related\nto our risk and control environment. A similar Committee was\nformed by the CBNA Board to provide oversight of management\u2019s\nremediation\nof issues identified under the Consent Order, dated October 7,\n2020, entered into by CBNA with the OCC (OCC Consent Order and\ntogether\nwith the FRB Consent Order, the Consent Orders). (Please see\npage 31 to review additional disclosure on the Transformation\nOversight Committee.)\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has delegated oversight of\nspecific risks, as set forth below, to certain other Board\ncommittees,\nbased on their mandates.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense model as a key component\nof its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense\nmodel brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk\nassurance under\none umbrella and provides an avenue for risk accountability of\nthe first line of defense, a construct for effective challenge\nby the second\nline of defense (Independent Risk Management and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management), and empowers independent risk\nassurance by the\nthird line of defense (Internal Audit). Citi has enterprise\nsupport functions that support safety and soundness across Citi.\nEach of the\nlines of defense and enterprise support functions, along with\nthe Board, are empowered to perform relevant risk management\nprocesses and\nresponsibilities in order to manage Citi\u2019s risks within the\ndefined risk appetite in a consistent and effective manner.\n\nFor more information about

Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  Corporate Governance  31  \n                            \nAt each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board\nreceives a risk report from the Chief Risk Officer with respect\nto the Company\u2019s approach to management of major risks,\nincluding\nmanagement\u2019s risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate.\nIndependent Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer, sets\nrisk and\ncontrol standards for the first line of defense and actively\nmanages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading and non-\ntrading),\nliquidity, strategic, operational and reputation risks across\nCiti, including risks that span categories, such as\nconcentration risk,\ncountry risk, compliance risk and climate risk. The Board\u2019s role\nis to oversee this effort.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee enhances the Board\u2019s\noversight of risk management. The Committee\u2019s role is one of\noversight, recognizing that management is responsible for\nexecuting\nCiti\u2019s risk management policies.\n\nTransformation Enhancements at Citi\n\nCiti is fully committed to a broad-based transformation,\nincluding with respect to risk management and controls. Citi\nbelieves its transformation\nis essential, not only to address regulatory matters in an\neffective, timely, and sustainable manner, but also as a broader\nstrategic\nimperative for the firm. Citi\u2019s priorities revolve around three\ninterconnected elements: its transformation, strategy, and\nculture\nand talent. Driving toward excellence in risk and controls in\nthe transformation is mutually reinforcing with Citi\u2019s business\nstrategy,\nand success for both can only be achieved with significant\nshifts in culture and talent.\n\nThe Board established the Transformation Oversight Committee in\nOctober 2020, to serve as the primary forum for Board oversight\nof Citi\u2019s\ntransformation. Given this overall responsibility of the\nTransformation Oversight Committee and the need for holistic\noversight, all non-management\ndirectors on the Board serve on the Committee. The full Board\nfocuses on non-transformation matters in other forums.\n\nA series of Program Groups focus on specific requirements of the\nConsent Orders. Certain members of the Transformation Oversight\nCommittee\n(Lead Directors) who have been assigned to the various Program\nGroups, work closely with the EMT members responsible for the\nrelevant\nProgram Groups to provide oversight and challenge to the Program\nGroups as they prepare for meetings with the entire\nTransformation Oversight\nCommittee, in much the same way as Board Committee Chairs\ninteract with individual senior management team members in\npreparation for committee\nmeetings.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Technology Oversight\n\nThe Board directly or through one or more Committees provides\noversight of Management\u2019s efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk\nand\nrespond to cyber incidents. The Board is briefed in full at\nleast annually, and one or more Committees receive regular\nreports on cybersecurity\nand engage in discussions throughout the year with Management\nand subject-matter experts on the effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\noverall\ncybersecurity program, cybersecurity risks, Citi\u2019s strategies\nfor addressing these risks and Citi\u2019s implementation thereof.\nThe Board participates in periodic cybersecurity tabletop\nexercises. Additionally, Board and/or Committee members receive\nreporting on\nsignificant cyber events including response efforts, legal\nobligations and outreach and notification to regulators and/or\ncustomers when\nneeded, as well as provide guidance to management as\nappropriate. The Risk Management Committee has approved a\nstandalone Cybersecurity\nRisk Appetite Statement against which Citi\u2019s performance is\nmeasured quarterly.\n\nThe Technology Committee also oversees technology matters as\ndiscussed on page 36 of this Proxy Statement. The Committee also\nhas primary\noversight for emerging technologies such as Generative\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, including the\nrisks or benefits related\nto emerging technologies. Members of the Technology Committee\nbring meaningful insight and expertise into how artificial\nintelligence\ntechnologies intersect with the financial services industry,\nfurther strengthening the Board\u2019s oversight of this important\narea.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Environmental and Social Matters\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors\nhas ultimate oversight of Citi\u2019s work to identify, assess and\nintegrate environmental and social-related risks and\nopportunities throughout Citi. In addition to oversight by the\nfull Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee\nof the Board oversees and reviews Citi\u2019s policies and programs\nfor sustainability, climate change, and human rights. The Risk\nManagement Committee of the Board reviews key risk policies,\nincluding those related to environmental, social and climate\nrisk. The\nAudit Committee has oversight over the controls and procedures\nrelated to Citi\u2019s group-level environmental, social- and\nclimate-related reporting, including both voluntary disclosures\nand regulatory filings. The Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee has held a number of meetings to review\nstockholder proposals and received an environmental and social\npriorities\nupdate in 2024.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  32  Corporate Governance  \n                            \nCommittees of the Board of Directors\n\nBelow are the standing committees of the Board of\nDirectors. In addition, the Board of Directors has an ad hoc\ncommittee, the Transformation Oversight Committee, which\noversees management\u2019s\nefforts to enhance its risk and control environment and achieve\noperational excellence.

For this purpose, an\nexecutive\nofficer means any person designated by Citi as an \u201cofficer\u201d\nunder Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies to all Citi employees,\nexecutive officers and Directors, states that when considering\npersonal\ninvestments in Citi securities, an individual must avoid any\npersonal trade or investment in a security, derivative, futures\ncontract,\ncommodity, or other financial instrument if the trade or\ninvestment might affect or appear to affect the individual\u2019s\nability to\nmake unbiased business decisions for Citi.\nwww.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                            \n  40  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nThe PTIP generally allows Covered Persons (excluding executive\nofficers) to hedge vested long positions of then deliverable\nCiti securities.Covered Persons under the PTIP include (but are\nnot limited to) individuals who (1) may have access to material\nnon-public informationregarding Citi, (2) are FINRA-registered\nemployees or associates of any of Citi\u2019s U.S. broker-dealer\nentities, or (3) work in a securities or advisory business in\nWealth, as well as certain individuals who are related to\nCovered Persons. Because executive officers who are Covered\nPersons under the PTIP are also subject to\nthe hedging policy applicable to directors and executive\nofficers pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, a\nproposed transaction\nby an executive officer may be prohibited by application of one\npolicy even if the transaction would be permissible under the\nother policy.\nFinally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K. and European\nregulatory requirements. These policies provide that all\nemployees in the\napplicable countries who receive a portion of their remuneration\nin stock or any other deferral mechanism designated by Citi must\nnot\ntake out insurance contracts or engage in personal hedging\nstrategies, or remuneration or liability-related contracts of\ninsurance, that\nundermine, or may undermine, any risk alignment effects of their\nremuneration arrangements.\nGroup Reputation Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC), a management\ncommittee, governs\nthe process by which material reputation risks are managed and\noversees that appropriate actions are taken in line with the\nfirm-wide\nstrategic objectives, risk appetite thresholds, and regulatory\nexpectations. The GRRC promotes a culture of risk awareness and\nhigh standards\nof integrity and ethical behavior across the company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value Proposition. Business-line\nReputation\nRisk Forums may escalate reputation risks for due consideration\nto the Group Reputation Risk Committee at the corporate level.\nThe Group\nReputation Risk Committee may escalate risks to the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board or another\nCommittee\nof the Board, as appropriate.\n\nCode of Ethics for Financial Professionals\n\nThe Citi Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals applies to\nCiti\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer),\nChief\nFinancial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) and Chief\nAccounting Officer & Controller (Principal Accounting Officer)\nand all Finance\nProfessionals and Administrative Staff in a finance role,\nincluding but not limited to Controllers, Controller Systems and\nData Operations,\nFinancial Planning & Analysis, Strategy and M&A, Treasury,\nFinance Chief Administrative Office, Finance Transformation,\nFunctions,\nO&T and Citi Expense Management, Tax, Investor Relations, and\nthe Business and Cluster teams.

The\nsize of the Board will be reduced to reflect these changes at\nthe commencement of the Annual Meeting. Each of the Directors\nwas last elected at the 2024 Annual Meeting, except for Titi\nCole, who the Board elected on January 31, 2025. Ms. Cole was\nrecommended as a candidate for election to Citi\u2019s Board by a\nnumber of Citi\u2019s Board members. Directors are not eligible to\nstand for re-election after reaching the age of 72. If elected,\neach nominee will hold office until the 2026 Annual Meeting or\nuntil his or her successor is qualified and elected.\n\nDirector Criteria and Nomination Process\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nconsiders all qualified candidates identified by members of the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, by other\nmembers of the Board, by senior management, and by security\nholders. During 2024, the Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to\nassist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees.\nStockholders who would like to propose a Director candidate for\nconsideration by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee may do so by submitting the candidate\u2019s name, r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\nand biographical information to the attention of the Corporate\nSecretary, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY\n10013. All proposals for nominations by stockholders received by\nthe Corporate Secretary will be presented to the Committee for\nits consideration.\n\nIn considering the composition of the Board of Directors, the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee inventories\nthe categories of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business\nmix, and geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates\nwith the skills and experience necessary to enable the Board of\nDirectors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also takes\nDirector tenure into consideration when making Director\nnomination decisions and believes that it is desirable to\nmaintain a mix of longertenured, experienced Directors and newer\nDirectors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs Committee and the Board also believe that\nlonger-tenured, experienced Directors are a significant strength\nof the Board, given the large size of our Company, the breadth\nof our product offerings, and the international scope of our\norganization. The Board\u2019s composition, and the individuals\nnominated for consideration by stockholders, are the result of\ncareful consideration by the Committee of the correspondence\nbetween the risk inventory and skills and experience of the\nBoard members and candidates. In addition to the ability to\nassist the Board in its oversight of a particular risk or risks,\nas more fully described in each nominee\u2019s biography, the members\nof the Board are assessed based on a variety of factors,\nincluding the following criteria, which have been developed by\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and\napproved by the Board:\n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that          \n  \u25cf  indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical    \n     standards;                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has had business, governmental,      \n     non-profit or professional experience at the chair, chief  \n     executive officer, chief                                   \n     operating officer, or equivalent policy-making and         \n     operational level of a large organization with             \n     significant international activities                       \n  \u25cf  across many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that      \n     indicates that the candidate will be able to make a        \n     meaningful and immediate contribution                      \n     to the Board\u2019s discussion of and decision-making on the    \n     array of complex issues facing a large financial services  \n     business that                                              \n     operates on a global scale;                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and a  \n     diverse background that would complement the attributes    \n  \u25cf  of the existing Directors,                                 \n     taking into consideration the diverse communities and      \n     geographies in which the Company operates;                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has the financial expertise          \n  \u25cf  required to provide effective oversight of a diversified   \n     financial services business                                \n     that operates on a global scale;                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has achieved prominence in his or    \n     her business, governmental, or professional activities     \n  \u25cf  and has built a reputation                                 \n     that demonstrates the ability to make the kind of          \n     important and sensitive judgments that the Board is        \n     called upon to make;                                       \n                                                                \nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  Proposal 1: Election of Directors  45  \n                                         \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate will effectively, consistently, and  \n     appropriately take into account and balance the            \n     legitimate interests and concerns                          \n  \u25cf  of all of the Company\u2019s stockholders and other             \n     stakeholders in reaching decisions, rather than advancing  \n     the interests of a particular                              \n     constituency;                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate possesses a willingness to           \n  \u25cf  challenge management while working constructively as part  \n     of a team in an environment                                \n     of collegiality and trust; and                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient    \n  \u25cf  time and energy to the performance of his or her duties    \n     as a Director.                                             \n                                                                \nApplication of these factors involves the exercise of judgment\nby the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and\nthe Board. In addition, see Board Composition on page 28 for\nadditional factors considered by the Board when selecting\ncandidates.\n\nBased on its assessment of each candidate\u2019s independence, skills\nand qualifications and the criteria described above, the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will make\nrecommendations regarding potential Director candidates to the\nBoard.\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee follows\nthe same process and uses the same criteria for evaluating\ncandidates proposed by stockholders, members of the Board of\nDirectors, and members of senior management. For the 2025 Annual\nMeeting, Citi did not receive notice from any stockholders\nregarding a nomination to the Board of Directors.\n\nDirector Qualifications\n\nThe nominees for the Board of Directors each have the\nqualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi\u2019s\nstrategy and to oversee management\u2019s execution of that strategic\nvision. Citi\u2019s Board of Directors consists of individuals with\nthe skills, experience, and diverse backgrounds necessary to\noversee Citi\u2019s efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller,\nsafer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk\nand operating within a complex financial and regulatory\nenvironment.\n\nThe nominees listed below are leaders in business, the financial\ncommunity, and academia because of their intellectual acumen and\nanalytical skills, strategic vision, ability to lead and inspire\nothers to work with them, and records of outstanding\naccomplishments over a period of decades. Each has been chosen\nto stand for election in part because of his or her ability and\nwillingness to ask difficult questions, understand Citi\u2019s unique\nchallenges, and evaluate the strategies proposed by management,\nas well as their implementation.\n\nEach of the nominees has a long record of professional\nintegrity, a dedication to his or her profession and community,\na strong work ethic that includes a commitment to coming fully\nprepared to meetings and being willing to spend the time and\neffort needed to fulfill professional obligations and the\nability to maintain a collegial environment.\n\nMany of our nominees are either current or former chief\nexecutive officers or chairs of other large international\ncorporations or have experience leading and operating large,\ncomplex academic or governmental departments. As such, they have\na deep understanding of, and extensive experience in, many of\nthe areas that are outlined below as being of critical\nimportance to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success. For the\npurposes of its analysis, the Board has determined that nominees\nwho have served as a chief executive officer or a chair of a\nmajor corporation or large, complex institution have extensive\nexperience with strategic planning, financial statement\npreparation, compensation determinations, regulatory compliance\n(if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate\ngovernance, public affairs, and legal matters.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                \n  46  Proposal                  \n      1: Election of Directors  \n                                \nIn evaluating the composition of the Board, the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee seeks to find and retain\nindividuals who, in addition to having the qualifications set\nforth in Citi\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, have the\nskills, experience and abilities necessary to meet Citi\u2019s unique\nneeds as a highly regulated financial services company with\noperations within the United States and more than 100 countries\naround the globe. The Committee has determined it is critically\nimportant to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success that its Board\nhas, in addition to the qualities described above, expertise and\nexperience in the following areas:\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Compensation, Performance Management and Culture       \n  Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of  \n  the CEO and                                                   \n  approving the compensation of other executive officers of     \n  the Company and the EMT. In order to properly carry out       \n  its responsibilities with respect to compensation, Citi\u2019s     \n  Board must include members who have experience evaluating     \n  the structure                                                 \n  of compensation for senior executives. They must understand   \n  the various forms of compensation that can be utilized, the   \n  purpose of each                                               \n  type and how various elements of compensation can be used to  \n  motivate and reward executives and drive performance, while   \n  not encouraging                                               \n  imprudent risk-taking or simply having short-term goals.      \n  Citi aspires to the highest standards of corporate            \n  governance and ethical conduct: doing what we say, reporting  \n  results with accuracy                                         \n  and transparency, and maintaining compliance with the laws,   \n  rules, and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s businesses.  \n  The Board                                                     \n  is responsible for shaping corporate governance policies and  \n  practices, including adopting the corporate governance        \n  guidelines applicable                                         \n  to the Company and monitoring the Company\u2019s compliance with   \n  governance policies and the guidelines. To carry out these    \n  responsibilities,                                             \n  the Board must include experienced leaders in the area of     \n  corporate governance who must be familiar with governance     \n  issues, the constituencies                                    \n  most interested in those issues, and the impact that          \n  governance policies have on the functioning of a company.     \n  Environmental and Sustainability matters are critical         \n  business issues, with ties to both risk and opportunity.      \n  Citi has been engaged in                                      \n  sustainability for over 20 years and views the environment,   \n  sustainability and transparency as important aspects of       \n  stockholder and broader                                       \n  stakeholder value. Citi communicates its sustainability and   \n  environmental efforts to stockholders, clients and other      \n  stakeholders. Citi\u2019s Board must include members with          \n  experience in the areas of climate change and finance,        \n  community development, corporate                              \n  social responsibility and other issues to help Citi navigate  \n  these complex and quickly evolving issues and to assist       \n  management in evaluating                                      \n  Citi\u2019s policies and programs.                                 \n  Citi\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are         \n  designed to ensure that Citi\u2019s financial reporting and its    \n  financial                                                     \n  statements are prepared in accordance with generally          \n  accepted accounting principles. While the Board and its       \n  committees are not responsible                                \n  for preparing our financial statements, they have oversight   \n  responsibility, including the selection of outside            \n  independent auditors, subject                                 \n  to stockholder ratification, and lead audit engagement        \n  partner. The Board must include members with direct or        \n  supervisory experience in                                     \n  the preparation of financial statements, as well as finance,  \n  audit, and accounting expertise.                              \n                                                                \nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                \n  Proposal                  47  \n  1: Election of Directors      \n                                \n                                                                \n  Citi                                                          \n  is a global leader providing financial services through the   \n  following business lines: (1) Services, (2) Markets, (3)      \n  Banking, (4) Wealth, and (5) USPB. Citi looks to its Board    \n  members with extensive financial services experience          \n  to assist it in evaluating its business model and strategies  \n  for reaching and servicing its clients.                       \n  As of December 31, 2024, Citi employs approximately 229,000   \n  people in more than 90 countries. Human capital management    \n  is a critical capability                                      \n  for Citi\u2019s Board given the strategic importance of            \n  maintaining a skilled, motivated workforce. Citi\u2019s Board      \n  must include Directors                                        \n  who understand key issues related to human capital including  \n  training, talent and engagement, employee benefits,           \n  compensation                                                  \n  programs, career trajectories, and U.S. and global labor      \n  issues. Having Directors with the appropriate expertise to    \n  review our succession                                         \n  strategy and leadership pipeline for key roles while taking   \n  into account Citi\u2019s long-term corporate strategy is           \n  paramount to managing                                         \n  Citi\u2019s resources\u2014its employees. Citi seeks out Board members  \n  who have had experience overseeing and managing executive     \n  teams                                                         \n  and a sizeable worldwide workforce, with an emphasis on       \n  development of human resources.                               \n  As a company with a broad international reach, Citi\u2019s Board   \n  values the perspectives of Directors with international       \n  business or                                                   \n  governmental experience or expertise in global economics.     \n  Citi\u2019s presence in markets outside the United States is an    \n  important competitive                                         \n  advantage for Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and    \n  foreign businesses and individual clients whose activities    \n  span the globe.                                               \n  Directors with international business experience can use the  \n  experience that they have developed through their own         \n  business dealings to                                          \n  assist Citi\u2019s Board and management in understanding and       \n  successfully navigating the business, political, and          \n  regulatory environments                                       \n  in countries in which Citi does or seeks to do business.      \n  Directors with global economics expertise can help guide      \n  Citi management in understanding                              \n  the challenges faced by other markets and in developing its   \n  global strategy.                                              \n  Citi and its subsidiaries are regulated and supervised by     \n  numerous regulatory agencies, both domestically and           \n  internationally, including                                    \n  in the U.S. the FRB, the OCC, the FDIC, the Consumer          \n  Financial Protection Bureau, and state banking                \n  and insurance departments, as well as international           \n  financial services authorities. Having Directors with         \n  experience interacting with                                   \n  regulators or operating businesses subject to extensive       \n  regulation is important to furthering Citi\u2019s continued        \n  compliance with its                                           \n  many regulatory requirements and fostering productive         \n  relationships with its regulators.

provide pay that is commensurate with \nthe substantial time commitment associated with service, and    \nfoster commonality of interest between Board members and our    \nstockholders.

Public Affairs Committee makes       \nrecommendations to the Board based on periodic benchmarking     \nassessments and advice received from FW Cook, its independent   \nadvisor. In making recommendations to the Board, the Committee  \nconsiders the competitive positioning of the aggregate and      \nindividual components of compensation, as well as the mix of pay\nand structure versus both direct competitors and other          \ncomparable organizations. The Committee also considers the      \nunique skill set required to serve on our Board and the intense \ntime commitment associated with preparation for and attendance  \nat meetings of the Board and its committees as well as external \ncommitments, such as engagement with our stockholders and       \nregulators. Since our initial public offering in 1986, Citi has \npaid outside Directors all or a portion of their compensation in\ncommon stock to ensure that the Directors have an ownership     \ninterest in common with other stockholders.                     \n                                                                \n  Annual                                                        \n  Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award                        \n  Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of     \n  $75,000 and a deferred stock award valued at $150,000. The    \n  deferred stock award                                          \n  is generally granted in early January. In the event a         \n  Director retires or resigns from the Board in the year for    \n  which an award is granted                                     \n  before attaining age 72, a pro rata portion of the award is   \n  forfeited, based on the number of full or partial calendar    \n  quarters served.                                              \n  The deferred stock award generally becomes distributable on   \n  the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and           \n  Directors may elect to                                        \n  defer receipt of the award beyond

The Audit Committee has concluded that the fees earned\nby\nKPMG were consistent with the maintenance of the external\nauditors\u2019 independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.\n\nThe Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided and\nfees earned by Citi\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm.\nThe Audit Committee annually considers the provision of audit\nservices and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined audit\nfees, audit-related\nfees, and tax-compliance fees with specific dollar-value limits\nfor each category of service. The Audit Committee also considers\non a\ncase-by-case basis specific engagements that are not otherwise\npre-approved (e.g., internal control and certain tax compliance\nengagements)\nor that exceed pre-approved fee amounts. On an interim basis,\nany proposed engagement that does not fit within the definition\nof a pre-approved\nservice may be presented to the Chair of the Audit Committee for\napproval and to the full Audit Committee at its next regular\nmeeting.\n\nThe Accounting Firm Engagement Procedure is the primary basis\nupon which management ensures the independence of its\nindependent registered\npublic accounting firm. Administration of the Procedure is\ncentralized in, and monitored by, Citi\u2019s Controllership\nfunction, which\nreports the engagements performed by KPMG throughout the year to\nthe Audit Committee. The Procedure also includes limitations on\nthe hiring\nof KPMG partners and other professionals to ensure that Citi\nsatisfies applicable auditor independence rules.\n\nKPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting\nfirm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. As in prior years,\nCiti\nand its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in\nconnection with the Audit Committee\u2019s consideration of whether\nto recommend\nthat stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as Citi\u2019s\nindependent auditor for the following year. In that review, the\nAudit Committee\nconsiders both the continued independence of KPMG and whether\nretaining KPMG is in the best interests of Citi and its\nstockholders. Citi\u2019s\nmanagement prepares an annual assessment of KPMG for the Audit\nCommittee that includes (i) the results of a management survey\nof KPMG\u2019s\noverall performance; (ii) review of external data on audit\nquality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG\nand its peer\nfirms; (iii) an analysis of KPMG\u2019s known legal risks and\nsignificant proceedings that may impair KPMG\u2019s ability to\nperform\nCiti\u2019s annual audit; and (iv) KPMG\u2019s fees and services provided\nto Citi both on an absolute basis, noting, of course, that\nKPMG does not provide any non-audit services, other than those\ndescribed in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and compared to\nservices provided\nby other auditing firms to peer institutions. In addition, KPMG\nreviews with the Audit Committee its analysis of its\nindependence in accordance\nwith the Accounting Firm Engagement Procedure and PCAOB Rule\n3526. In performing its analysis, the Audit Committee considered\nthe length\nof time KPMG has been Citi\u2019s independent auditor, the breadth\nand complexity of Citi\u2019s business and its global footprint and\nthe resulting demands placed on its auditing firm in terms of\nexpertise in Citi\u2019s businesses, the quantity and quality of\nstaff,\nand global reach. The Audit Committee also considered the\npotential benefits and challenges associated with audit firm\nrotation and decided\nthat rotation is not in the best interests of Citi\u2019s\nstockholders at this time. The Audit Committee recognized the\nability of KPMG\nto provide both the necessary expertise to audit Citi\u2019s business\nand the matching global footprint to audit Citi worldwide and\nother\nfactors, including the policies that KPMG follows with respect\nto rotation of the key audit personnel, so that there is a new\npartner-in-charge\nat least every five years. Citi\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the\nprocess for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the\nindependent\nauditor\u2019s lead engagement partner at the five-year mandatory\nrotation period. At the Audit Committee\u2019s instruction, KPMG\nselects\ncandidates to be considered for the lead engagement partner\nrole, who are then interviewed by members of Citi\u2019s senior\nmanagement.\nAfter considering the candidates recommended by KPMG, senior\nmanagement makes a recommendation to the Audit Committee\nregarding the new\nlead engagement partner. After discussing the qualifications of\nthe proposed lead engagement partner with the current lead\nengagement\npartner and senior leadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit\nCommittee, individually and/or as a group, interview the leading\ncandidate.\nThe Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes as\nan Audit Committee on the selection. Based on the results of its\nreview\nthis year, the Audit Committee concluded that KPMG is\nindependent and that it is in the best interests of Citi and its\ninvestors to appoint\nKPMG to serve as Citi\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2025.\n                                                                \n  Board                                                         \n  Recommendation                                                \n  The                                                           \n  Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of KPMG as Citi\u2019s    \n  independent registered public accounting firm for 2025.       \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n      \n  68  \n      \nProposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024 Executive\nCompensation\n\nWe are seeking a nonbinding, advisory vote approving the\ncompensation of our named executive officers (NEOs) disclosed in\nthis Proxy Statement,\nas required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule\n14a-21(a) thereunder.

But changes in the individuals leading our\norganization do not only reflect a changed leadership structure,\nbut also an intentional effort to strengthen our firm by\npromoting our most promising talent from within and combining\nthem with experienced and successful hires from outside the\norganization. Although change is constant, the leadership team\nchanges coalesced during 2024 with two new important additions.\n\nAn outcome of that\nintentional effort is half of Citi\u2019s EMT (excluding Ms. Fraser\nherself), representing eight of the current 16 Citi executive\nofficers, were not EMT members when Ms. Fraser became CEO in\n2021. Those eight new EMT members include the leaders of each of\nCiti\u2019s five business units. Of those five business unit leaders,\nthree were promoted internally and two were recruited from\nthe leadership of other financial services organizations. Of the\neleven other members of the EMT, eight were EMT members at the\ncommencement of Ms. Fraser\u2019s tenure. The other three\nwererecruited to Citi from\nsenior positions in government, the accounting profession and\nthe financial services industry. The changes to the EMT group\necho\nwithin the next group of Citi\u2019s leadership by seniority.\n\nOur ability to promote and attract new leadership talent to\nCiti, and to retain the experienced senior leaders we have,\nisattributable in significant\npart to Ms. Fraser\u2019s ability to convincingly communicate a\nvision for our organization and its opportunity for success in\nboth the\nnear- and long-term.\n\nWhile there will be a natural evolution to\nleadership roles as time goes on, the Board believes that the\nactions that Ms. Fraser has taken in 2024 to complete the\nbuildout of her\nleadership team has put Citi on the right path to operate\nfaster, deliver improved financial results, accelerate our\ntransformation progress\nand compete effectively.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024  71  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \n2024 NEO Compensation Rationale\n                                                                \n  OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES                                      \n  The Compensation Committee\u2019s compensation                     \n  determination reflects its belief that Ms.                    \n  Fraser\u2019s strategic and other priorities are sound             \n  and that she is executing on them promptly and                \n  thoughtfully, with an eye towards enhanced safety             \n  and soundness, improved returns and laying the                \n  foundation for long-term sustainable growth. These            \n  priorities include improved financial performance;            \n  executing on Citi\u2019s transformation; aligning                  \n  Citi\u2019s organizational structure to its business               \n  strategy and increasing accountability,                       \n  transparency and focus of execution for Citi\u2019s                \n  businesses, including exiting or winding down                 \n  Citi\u2019s remaining international consumer markets to            \n  simplify the business; and strengthening our                  \n  leadership and talent.                                        \n  It was critical for us to demonstrate in 2024 that            \n  we are delivering on our priorities laid out at               \n  our 2022 Investor Day. The Compensation Committee             \n  assessed that tangible progress can now be seen in            \n  our business performance, our meaningful                      \n  simplification of the firm, the strengthening of              \n  our culture and talent and the progress we are                \n  making on our transformation.                                 \n  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE                                         \n  Citi demonstrated improved overall financial                  \n  performance in 2024. Each of Citi\u2019s five interconnected       \n  businesses \u2014 Services, Markets, Banking, Wealth and USPB      \n  \u2014 reported year-over-year increases in revenues. In           \n  addition, the firm, as well as each of the five businesses,   \n  achieved                                                      \n  positive Operating Leverage for the full year, despite        \n  higher volumeand transformation-related expenses and other    \n  investments in                                                \n  risk and control initiatives.                                 \n  The firm\u2019s 2024 net income was up 37%, revenues were up 3%    \n  (5% excluding divestiture impacts), tangible book value per   \n  share was                                                     \n  up 4% and RoTCE was up approximately 210 basis points, in     \n  each case from 2023. Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital Ratio was up to      \n  13.6%. Citi also                                              \n  returned $6.7 billion during 2024 to common stockholders      \n  through dividends and stock repurchases.                      \n  TRANSFORMATION                                                \n  In 2024, Citi made steady and meaningful progress in          \n  advancing its transformation, including the issues            \n  identified in the Consent Orders,                             \n  most notably in risk management, modernization of technology  \n  and infrastructure and improving resiliency across the        \n  organization, but                                             \n  not as much progress as intended. As we have stated before,   \n  the transformation is a multiyear endeavor and the results    \n  cannot be expected                                            \n  to be linear. Citi is not only addressing regulatory          \n  requirements, it is also modernizing and simplifying itself   \n  in order to lead in a                                         \n  dynamic, competitive and digital business world. It requires  \n  that we address decades of underinvestment in Citi\u2019s          \n  infrastructure,                                               \n  going beyond remedying numerous regulatory concerns to        \n  intentionally transforming how the organization operates,     \n  and making investments                                        \n  that not only support current needs but also benefit Citi     \n  over the long term. Of course, transformation efforts of      \n  this scale involve                                            \n  significant complexities and uncertainties. While we still    \n  have a lot of work to do, as evidenced by the Civil Money     \n  Penalty Consent Orders                                        \n  described on page 14 above, we have made important progress   \n  since our transformation work began. As a result of these     \n  recent regulatory                                             \n  actions, Citi has made changes to its governance and          \n  structure of its data program and has increased the level of  \n  investment in the program.                                    \n  LEADERSHIP AND TALENT                                         \n  As discussed on page 70, Ms. Fraser\u2019s ability to              \n  convincingly communicate an overall vision for the            \n  organization and the near-term                                \n  opportunities that vision presents has enabled the            \n  recruitment and retention of key leadership talent,           \n  transforming the leadership of                                \n  the organization.                                             \n  SIMPLIFICATION                                                \n  Citi                                                          \n  has also made substantial progress towards achieving the      \n  strategic goal of organizational simplification as presented  \n  at our                                                        \n  2022 Investor Day. One part of that initiative involved       \n  refocusing our firm around five interconnected businesses \u2014   \n  Services,                                                     \n  Markets, Banking, Wealth and USPB \u2014 each with a clear path    \n  to accelerating growth, gaining share and increasing          \n  returns. In addition, since announcing our intention to exit  \n  consumer banking across 14 markets in Asia, Europe,           \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  72  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  the                                                           \n  Middle East and Mexico as part of our strategic refresh, we   \n  closed sales in nine of those markets, and the wind-downs of  \n  Citi\u2019s consumer businesses in China and Korea and overall     \n  presence in Russia are nearly complete. Most notably, at the  \n  end of                                                        \n  2024, we successfully separated our consumer, small and       \n  middle market banking businesses in Mexico (Banamex) from     \n  our institutional                                             \n  business, a significant undertaking and critical              \n  accomplishment in our path to executing an initial public     \n  offering of Banamex                                           \n  stock. We are currently in the midst of the sales process     \n  for our consumer business in Poland.                          \n  A second part of that initiative involved                     \n  rethinking our operating model. During 2024 we                \n  finalized the implementation of a new, flatter                \n  management model, eliminating layers and regional             \n  structures, and enhancing leadership                          \n  accountability in each interconnected business to             \n  make Citi a simpler, better-controlled firm that              \n  can operate faster, improve client service and                \n  unlock value for stockholders.                                \n  CEO COMPENSATION                                              \n  The Compensation Committee increased Ms. Fraser\u2019s total       \n  compensation from $26 million in 2023 to $34.5 million in     \n  2024 in recognition                                           \n  of the progress and achievements described above, because it  \n  concluded that Ms. Fraser\u2019s strategy was solid, and her       \n  leadership                                                    \n  in regard to the execution of the strategic objectives        \n  exemplary, and in light of competitive pay considerations.    \n  In making its decision, the Compensation Committee            \n  also considered Citi\u2019s absolute and relative TSR              \n  during 2024, including the various elements of                \n  Citi\u2019s executive compensation program that tie                \n  compensation to TSR.                                          \n  To align Ms. Fraser\u2019s compensation with stockholder           \n  interests, the Compensation Committee determined that the     \n  components of her                                             \n  2024 incentive compensation would, as in prior years, be      \n  weighted toward stock-based compensation. Ms. Fraser\u2019s        \n  compensation is                                               \n  aligned with stockholder interests through various features   \n  of our compensation program that tie the amount of            \n  compensation to our TSR                                       \n  and financial metrics.

A        \n  description of the Transformation                             \n  Bonus Program was included in our 2022 Proxy Statement.       \n  Additional information related to the Transformation Bonus    \n  Program can be found                                          \n  in the supplemental solicitation materials Citi filed with    \n  the SEC in 2022, which can be accessed at www.citigroup.com.  \n  Ms. Fraser has                                                \n  not been eligible to participate in the Transformation Bonus  \n  Program.                                                      \n  Following the completion of the third and final performance   \n  measurement period under the Program, the Compensation        \n  Committee determined                                          \n  that the Performance Achievement Percentage for the period    \n  ending on December 31, 2024 would be 53%. The Performance     \n  Achievement Percentage                                        \n  determination reflected the Compensation Committee\u2019s          \n  assessment of performance relative to preset objective        \n  targets.                                                      \n  The terms and conditions of the Transformation Bonus Program  \n  were not changed for 2024. In approving the Transformation    \n  Bonus Program,                                                \n  the Compensation Committee did not intend that it would be a  \n  replacement, substitution or make-up for any other            \n  compensation amount, nor                                      \n  does the Compensation Committee expect to make other special  \n  awards related to our transformation efforts in the future.   \n  For further information concerning the                        \n  Transformation Bonus Program see pages 89 to 91.              \n  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS                                          \n  As described on page 88, the Compensation Committee           \n  determined that 66.4% of the target number of shares subject  \n  to PSUs granted as part                                       \n  of our 2021 incentive compensation awards were earned for     \n  the three-year performance period from 2022 through 2024.     \n  The resulting payout                                          \n  value was equal to 78.9% of initial value, including the      \n  impact of both financial performance and TSR during the       \n  three-year performance                                        \n  period from 2022 through 2024, as compared to a 93% payout    \n  for the prior performance period.                             \n  Citi delivers a portion of incentive compensation for our     \n  EMT in the form of PSUs. For 2024, we expanded the use of     \n  PSUs to cover all                                             \n  11 members of the Citi Operating Team to further align the    \n  incentive program for those leaders.                          \n                                                                \nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024  73  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \nOur Compensation Philosophy\n\nOur Compensation Philosophy is designed to\nencourage prudent risk-taking and management of controls while\nattracting the world-class talent necessary for our success.\n\nThe full statement of our Compensation Philosophy is available\non our public website at www.citigroup.com.\n\nConsistent with our Compensation Philosophy,\nwe design our executive pay program to motivate balanced\nbehaviors.

This\nincludes the\nremediation of issues identified in the Consent Orders by the FR\nB and the OCC. The transformation addresses decades of\nunderinvestment\nin Citi\u2019s infrastructure, going beyond remedying numerous\nregulatory concerns to intentionally transforming how the\norganization\noperates and making investments that not only support current\nneeds but also benefit Citi and its clients over the long term.\n\nIn 2024, Citi made progress in advancing its transformation,\nincluding consolidating its balance sheet reporting to one\nunified ledger,\nimplementing a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better\nvalue trading assets and closing out a separate long-standing\nconsent\norder. However, that progress fell short in certain areas. In\nparticular, data quality management and regulatory reporting did\nnot make\nas much progress as necessary. Management was transparent about\nthe situation and changed the governance of the data program\nwhile increasing\ninvestment in it.\n\nAs a consequence, both the FR B and the OCC took additional\nenforcement actions against Citi in July 2024. In addition, the\nBoard held\nmanagement accountable by reducing the amount of payout for the\nlast tranche of the Transformation Bonus Program award, as\ndescribed on\npage 90. The Board and management team remain committed to the\nsuccess of the transformation and addressing the issues\nidentified in the\nConsent Orders.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024  77  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \n                     \n  Leadership Pillar  \n                     \nLeadership skills across the workforce are a key to\nthe success of our transformation.

                   \nThe following summarizes the terms of PSUs awarded\nby us in 2025 in respect of performance during 2024 (2024 PSUs).\nThe performance metrics approved for the 2024 PSUs are RoTCE and\nTBVPS,\nand cover the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027.\nThe RoTCE metric has been adjusted compared to the prior year\nPSUs to\nuse change in RoTCE, rather than absolute RoTCE, for relative\nperformance purposes reflecting stockholder feedback. The TBVPS\ngrid metrics\nhave been increased consistent with past practice.\n\nMETRIC PERFORMANCE AND RELATED EARNED PSUs\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n

Our transformation includes efforts to\neffectively\nremediate the Consent Orders. For additional information about\nour transformation and the Consent Orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d in Citi\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Citi\u2019s\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October\n7, 2020.\n\nColleagues at all levels are expected to play an\nactive role in achieving these target outcomes, and senior\nleaders are accountable for driving progress. To incentivize\neffective execution\nin connection with the Consent Order programs and to drive\nchange in Citi\u2019s risk and control environment and culture, in\nAugust\n2021 the Compensation Committee approved the Transformation\nBonus Program. A description of the Transformation Bonus Program\nwas included\nin our 2022 Proxy Statement. Additional information related to\nthe Transformation Bonus Program can be found in the\nsupplemental solicitation\nmaterials filed by us in 2022 with the SEC, which can be\naccessed on our public website at www.citigroup.com.\nMs. Fraser has not been eligible to participate in the\nTransformation Bonus Program. All other members of our EMT at\nthe time the Program\nwas adopted, as well as approximately 250 other employees who\nwere deemed to be critical to execution in connection with the\nConsent Order\nprograms, were eligible to participate in the Transformation\nBonus Program.\nPerformance under our Transformation Bonus Program has been\nbased on the collective achievement of metrics in various\ncategories, rather\nthan on individual performance, in order to foster a unified,\ncollective focus on achieving key transformation goals and\nensure consistent\nleadership throughout the multiyear effort. Central to the\ndesign of the Transformation Bonus Program was the recognition\nthat our ability\nto achieve the objectives of our transformation requires\ncollective effort over a multiyear period. Accordingly,\nparticipants in the\nTransformation Bonus Program have been collectively evaluated\nagainst outcomes in order to foster a culture of shared\naccountability.\n\nPerformance has been measured, and the bonus, if any, payable\npursuant to the Transformation Bonus Program has been in three\ntranches,\neach representing a separate performance period. Specific goals\nand related metrics were established for each of the three\ntranches. The\nmaximum portion of the bonus payable for each tranche was: 25%\nfor the first tranche, 25% for the second tranche and 50% for\nthe third\ntranche.\n\nShortly before each designated payment date, an assessment was\nmade by the Compensation Committee to determine what portion \u2013\nif\nany \u2013 of the relevant tranche was collectively earned based on\nperformance relative to specific preset targets for the\napplicable\nperformance period. The portion to be paid out for each tranche\nhas been applied to all participants in the Transformation Bonus\nProgram\non a consistent basis. For example, while a maximum of 25% of\nthe award could be earned for the first tranche, if the\nCompensation Committee\ndetermined, based on the relevant criteria, that collective\nperformance merited only a 15% payout, then each participant\nwould only be\npaid 15% for that tranche (assuming they satisfied all other\nconditions for entitlement to be paid).\n\nThe first and second tranches were only impacted by performance\nrelative to preset targets. Each constituted a maximum of 25% of\nthe award.\nThe third tranche, which constituted a maximum of 50% of the\naward, was affected by both performance relative to preset\nobjective targets\nand stock performance. For this third tranche, once performance\nwas accounted for and the base payout was determined to be\neither the\nmaximum 50% or some lower percentage as described above, the\npayout was further adjusted based on stock performance. That is,\nthe payout\namount was further adjusted downward or upward as if that payout\nhad been invested in Citi common stock from the date of grant of\neach\naward through the payment date for the third tranche, taking\ninto account stock price changes and the sum of dividends paid\n(without interest\nor assumed reinvestment), consistent with our customary approach\nfor equity-based compensation.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  90  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \nParticipants must have continued to be actively employed by Citi\nat the payment date to receive a payment. Payments were further\nsubject\nto all Transformation Bonus Program conditions, including\ndemonstrable leadership in all job specific aspects of the\ntransformation, a\nsatisfactory Risk and Control Pillar performance rating under\nour normal annual incentive assessment process, and the rules of\nour Accountability\nFramework. Payments were also subject to cancellation and\nclawback provisions as described on page 95.\n\nThere was no opportunity to make up for reductions to earlier\ntranches through exceptional performance for later tranches. In\napproving\nthe Transformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee did\nnot intend that it would be a replacement, substitution or make-\nup for\nany other compensation amount, nor does the Compensation\nCommittee expect to make other special awards related to our\ntransformation in\nthe future.\n\nThe Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors\neach formed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc\ncommittee of each Board, to provide oversight of management\u2019s\nremediation efforts under the Consent Orders. The primary focus\nfor the first part of our remediation efforts involved the\ndevelopment of comprehensive plans to remediate our regulatory\nissues and submission of those plans to our regulators. The\nprimary\nfocus for the second part of our remediation efforts involved\nexecution on those plans.\n\nTranche 3 Payout Determination\n\nThe Compensation Committee determined\nthat the performance metric categories for the third and final\ntranche of the program, covering the calendar year 2024\nperformance period,\nwere the same as those for Tranche 2:\n                                                                \n     Timely                                                     \n  \u25cf  Execution of specific actions management must have taken   \n     during Phase 3 of our remediation plan                     \n     Execution                                                  \n  \u25cf  quality, which is the percentage of milestones reviewed    \n     by Citi\u2019s Internal Audit function that it deemed to be     \n     complete                                                   \n     Culture                                                    \n     change, a qualitative consideration, which is based on a   \n  \u25cf  broad-based employee survey that is designed to measure    \n     cultural alignment                                         \n     with our Leadership Principles                             \n                                                                \nThe terms and conditions of the Transformation\nBonus Program were not changed for 2024.\n\nAs discussed on page 14, in July 2024, the FRB and OCC took\nfurther regulatory actions in connection with the Consent\nOrders. Citi has acknowledged that, despite making important\nprogress in advancing the transformation, including remediating\nthe Consent Orders, there were areas where we have not made\nprogress quickly enough, such as in our data quality management\nrelated to governance and regulatory reporting. These areas are\nincluded in the performance metric categories referenced above\nand therefore also had an impact on the payout of Tranche 3 of\nthe Transformation Bonus Program.\n\nFollowing the completion of the third and final performance\nmeasurement period under the Transformation Bonus Program, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the payout for the period\nending on December 31, 2024 would be down, consistent with\nCiti\u2019s fourth quarter 2024 earnings call and 2024 Annual Report\non Form 10-K, and set the Performance Achievement Percentage at\n53%.\n\nAdditionally, pursuant to the original Transformation Bonus\nProgram terms, as described above, the payout of Tranche 3 was\nrequired to be indexed (up or down) to reflect TSR over the\nthree-year performance period. TSR was required to be calculated\nconsistent with our customary approach for cash-settled equity-\nbased incentive awards. The starting value for this calculation\nis $70.37, the average closing price of our stock from October\n25 through 29, 2021, the five-day period before awards were\ngranted to participants. The ending value for this calculation\nis $83.31, the five-day average of closing prices for the stock\nfor the period ending on February 19, 2025, the scheduled\npayment date for the third tranche. Cumulative TSR for the\nperformance period calculated on that basis was approximately\n15%, so the payout value for the third and final performance\nmeasurement period, pursuant to the original Transformation\nBonus Program terms, was 68% (53% Performance Achievement\nPercentage plus 15% TSR).\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024  91  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \nProgram Outcomes\n\nAll three performance measurement periods under\nthe Transformation Bonus Program have been completed and the\nCompensation Committee has determined the following results:\n                                                                \n  Performance Period                                            \n  Period ending December 31,     Performance Achievement        \n  2022                           Percentage                     \n  Period ending December 31,     94%                            \n  2023                           80%                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Period ending December 31,     53%                            \n  2024                                                          \n                                                                \nCiti provides the OCC and the FRB on an ongoing\nbasis information regarding its plans and progress and continues\nto work constructively with both regulators to reflect their\nfeedback\non its remediation efforts.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  92  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \nCompensation Process and Governance\n\nOur Annual Compensation Process\n\nThe following summarizes the principal elements\nof our process for setting incentive compensation for our NEOs.\n\nWe adopted our Compensation Accountability\nand Rationale Tool in 2020 as a means for administering our new\ncompensation principles and practices. CART is an integral part\nof our\ncompensation framework that resulted in significantly increased\ntransparency and discipline with respect to the impact of risk\nand control\nperformance on compensation decisions. CART\u2019s most important\nfeature is that it requires managers to provide performance\ndetails\nacross each of the four CART pillars \u2013 Risk and Control,\nFinancial, Client and Franchise, and Leadership \u2013 to support\ncompensation\ndecisions.\n\nCART creates a comprehensive record evidencing\nhow risk was considered in compensation decisions. This practice\nenables us to systematically hold each manager of an in-scope\nemployee\naccountable in a disciplined way for management of risk and\ncontrols and for determining compensation.\n\nEach named executive officer\u2019s total\nincentive award is based on a market benchmarking process,\nCiti\u2019s overall achievements, and individual executive\nperformance\nagainst applicable goals. Target compensation is aligned through\na market benchmarking process, with market rates of pay adjusted\nto\nreflect each named executive officer\u2019s experience and scope of\nrole as the starting point for incentive pay. Each named\nexecutive officer\u2019s performance is evaluated against the four\npillars and is informed by metrics contained in the\nexecutive\u2019s scorecard. The Compensation Committee then considers\nhow performance in each pillar impacts the incentive\ncompensation amount and written narrative assessments for each\nof the four pillars are completed linking pay to performance.\nThe Compensation Committee completes this assessment for our CEO\nand contributes to the assessments for our other executive\nofficers.\n\nUnder our compensation framework, our Compensation\nCommittee uses a five-step process when making final\ndeterminations regarding named executive officer incentive\ncompensation. The steps\nare illustrated in the following graphic and summarized\nimmediately below the graphic.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                     \n  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024  93  \n  Executive Compensation                             \n                                                     \n                                                                \n     Goal                                                       \n     Setting for Scorecards                                     \n  1  Approve employee-by-employee customized                    \n     scorecard goals aligned to each of the four performance    \n     pillars and the employee\u2019s job responsibilities            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     The                                                        \n     Compensation Committee approves scorecard goals for each   \n     named executive officer early in                           \n     the annual compensation cycle.

The\nCompensation Committee considers named executive officer\ncompensation\nin the context of pay levels and performance at a 13-member peer\ngroup and a smaller core peer group consisting of five\nU.S.-based global\nbanks with lines of business and scale similar to ours.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with input from\nits independent compensation consultant, established our\ncompensation peer group. The Compensation Committee evaluates\nthe compensation\npeer group on an annual basis to ensure that the group continues\nto be appropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to\nbelieve that\na U.S.-based peer group reflects the relevant market for\nexecutive talent and the relevant regulatory environment for our\nexecutive compensation.\n\nWe chose the peers because they operate in one\nor more lines of business that are similar to ours and compete\nin similar labor markets. In selecting the compensation peer\ngroup, the\nCompensation Committee uses size-based metrics as primary\nscreening criteria among financial services firms. Citigroup\u2019s\nsize relative\nto its full peer group is generally near or above the 75th\npercentile but is closer to median when compared to its core\npeers. Citi\u2019s\nbusiness is relatively complex compared to peers because of the\nglobal scope and depth of its business.\n                                                        \n  2024                                                  \n  COMPENSATION PEER GROUP                               \n  AIG                      Goldman       Prudential     \n  (AIG)                    Sachs (GS)    (PRU)          \n  American                 JPMorgan      U.S.           \n  Express (AXP)            Chase (JPM)   Bancorp (USB)  \n  Bank                     MetLife       Wells          \n  of America (BAC)         (MET)         Fargo (WFC)    \n  BNY                      Morgan                       \n  Mellon (BK)              Stanley (MS)                 \n  Capital                  PNC                          \n  One (COF)                (PNC)                        \n                                                        \nIn evaluating the market\nfor named executive officer compensation, the Compensation\nCommittee focuses primarily on compensation for comparable roles\nat the U.S.-based\nglobal banks with lines of business and scale similar to ours:\nBank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley,\nand Wells\nFargo.

FW Cook advised the\nCompensation Committee\nregarding the compensation awarded to the CEO and other\nexecutive officers. FW Cook also provided extensive guidance and\nanalysis regarding\nthe Compensation Committee\u2019s and the Board of Director\u2019s\nresponses to our advisory say on pay votes, offered market\ninsights,\nand provided advice to the Compensation Committee on our\nexecutive compensation plan design and the presentation of our\nprograms to stockholders\nthrough the investor outreach process described earlier as well\nas required SEC disclosures. FW Cook also provides advice to the\nBoard\nof Directors on non-executive director compensation. Pursuant to\nSEC and NYSE rules, the Compensation Committee assessed the\nindependence\nof FW Cook, most recently in March 2025, and determined that FW\nCook is independent from our management and that its work for\nthe Compensation\nCommittee has not raised any conflicts of interest.\n                                           \n  TAX                                      \n  DEDUCTIBILITY OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                                           \nSection 162(m) of the Internal                                  \nRevenue Code limits our ability to deduct compensation paid to  \nour NEOs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally to $1  \nmillion                                                         \nper year.

Citi\nhas not granted extra years of credited service under any\nretirement plan to any of the NEOs. Ms. Fraser and Messrs.\nRaghavan and Morton\nhave never been eligible to participate in a defined benefit\npension plan under the terms of Citi\u2019s broad-based retirement\nprograms\nin effect in their employment countries; they have participated\nonly in defined contribution retirement plans since the\ncommencement of\ntheir employment at Citi.\n\nThe following describes the pension plans listed\nin the 2024 Pension Benefits Table.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan. The purpose of this broad-based,\ntax-qualified retirement plan is to provide retirement income on\na tax-deferred basis to\nall eligible U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2006, The\nCitigroup Pension Plan was closed to new members and generally\nceased\nbenefit accruals effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Mason and Mr.\nSieg are eligible for benefits under this plan. Their entire\nbenefits are cash balance benefits.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit is expressed as\na hypothetical account balance. Prior to January 1, 2008, the\nplan generally provided for the annual accrual of benefit\ncredits for most of the covered population, including thecovered\nNEOs, at a rate between 1.5%\nand 6% of eligible compensation; the benefit credit rate\nincreased with age and service. Eligible compensation generally\nincluded base salary and incentive awards, but excluded\ncompensation payable after termination of employment, certain\nnon-recurring payments, and other benefits. Annual eligible\ncompensation was limited by the Internal Revenue Code to\n$225,000 for 2007 (the final year of cash balance benefit\naccrual). Interest creditscontinue to be applied annually to\neach participant\u2019s\naccount balance; these credits are based on the yield on 30-year\nTreasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue Service).\n\nBenefits under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable\nin annuity form or in other optional forms, including a lump\nsum, upon termination of employment. The Citigroup Pension\nPlan\u2019s normal\nretirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant\u2019s\nbenefit determined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula\nmay\nbe paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this purpose\nas the first day of the month after the later of the\nparticipant\u2019s\n55th birthday or the date on which the participant completes a\nyear of service (as defined in the plan).\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  106  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2024 Executive  \n       Compensation                                             \n                                                                \nPayments upon Termination or Change of Control\n\nGeneral Policies.

Set forth below\nis a table showing the estimated value of outstanding awards\nthat would have been delivered over time to each named executive\nofficer\nemployed by Citi on December 31, 2024, had the applicable\nemployment termination or other event occurred on December 31,\n2024 and assuming\nthat all award vesting and performance conditions are satisfied.\nUnless the awards are forfeited, the awards shown in the\nPotential Payments\nTable vest on schedule following termination of employment and\ndo not accelerate by their terms except in the case of death.\nThe closing\nprice of

However, the     \n     \u201ccompensation actually paid\u201d in the table above does not   \n     reflect the                                                \n  \u00b7  full extent of the alignment between the compensation we   \n     actually paid and our TSR, because changes in the value    \n     of vested (but unpaid)                                     \n     Deferred Stock Awards are not reflected in \u201ccompensation   \n     actually paid\u201d.

If Proposal 4\nis approved\nby stockholders at our Annual Meeting, we intend to file a\nregistration statement on Form S-8, pursuant to the Securities\nAct of 1933,\nas amended, to register the additional shares authorized for\ngrant under the 2019 Plan.\n\nGeneral. The 2019 Plan became effective on April 16,\n2019 and will expire on the date of the 2024 annual meeting of\nstockholders unless this Proposal 4 is approved by stockholders\nat the\n2024 Annual Meeting. The 2019 Plan provides for various types of\nawards denominated in shares of Citi common stock to Citi\nemployees,\nofficers, and non-employee Directors. The NYSE closing price of\na share of Citi common stock on March 3, 2025 was $77.17.\n\nAdministration.The 2019 Plan is administered by the\nCompensation Committee. All members of such Committee or a sub-\ncommittee thereof must satisfy the requirements for independence\nof SEC\nRule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside\nDirectors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board of\nDirectors. The Compensation\nCommittee may delegate some or all of its authority over\nadministration of the 2019 Plan to one or more officers,\ndirectors, employees,\nor another plan administrator except with respect to persons who\nare Section 16(a) officers. In addition, any special terms or\nconditions\nthat the Compensation Committee considers necessary or\nappropriate to accommodate differences in non-U.S. law, tax\npolicy or custom may\nbe included in a sub-plan that forms a part of the 2019 Plan.\n\nEligibility. All \u201cemployees\u201d of Citi\u2014within the broad\ndefinition set forth in the instructions to the SEC Form S-8\nregistration statement, as in effect on April 16, 2019 with\nrespect to the\nCiti or any of its subsidiaries, but expressly excluding\nconsultants and advisors who are not members of the Board of\nDirectors\u2014generally\nare eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. Based on\nworldwide employment at December 31, 2024, approximately 229,000\npersons\ncould be eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan. However,\nparticipation is discretionary\u2014awards are subject to approval by\nthe\nCompensation Committee. In general, employees with discretionary\nannual incentive awards of at least $75,000 are eligible to\nreceive at\nleast 15% of that annual award in deferred stock. For the twelve\nmonths ending March 1, 2025, awards were made under the 2019\nPlan to\n13 non-employee Directors, 17 executive officers, and\napproximately 12,000 employees worldwide. Former \u201cemployees\u201d are\neligible\nto participate in the 2019 Plan, but only with respect to their\nlast year of service or in connection with a sale, spin-off or\nother similar\ntransaction.\n\nShares subject to the 2019 Plan.Shares of Citi common stock\nissued in connection with awards\nunder the 2019 Plan may be shares that are authorized but\nunissued, or previously issued shares that have been reacquired,\nor both. The\ninitial share authorization under the 2019 Plan was 30 million\nshares. Pursuant to amendments approved at the 2020 Annual\nMeeting, the\n2021 Annual Meeting, the 2022 Annual Meeting, the 2023 Annual\nMeeting, and the 2024 Annual Meeting, the number of authorized\nshares increased\nby 15 million, 20 million, 36 million, 28 million, and 30\nmillion respectively.

A restricted stock award is an award     \n     of outstanding shares of Citi common stock that does not   \n     vest until vesting conditions are satisfied and which      \n     will be forfeited if conditions                            \n     to vesting are not met. Participants may receive           \n  \u00b7  dividends on the shares subject to their awards during     \n     the vesting period, unless the                             \n     awards are subject to one or more performance conditions,  \n     in which case the dividends, if any, shall be paid only    \n     if and when, and only                                      \n     to the extent that, the underlying shares vest.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Deferred stock.

Awards granted under\nthe 2019 Plan may not vest earlier than the first anniversary of\nthe date on which the award is granted, except that the\nCompensation\nCommittee may grant awards that vest inless than a year (i) as a\n\u201csubstitute award\u201d\nto replace awards of a former employer acquired by the Company,\n(ii) awards to Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-\nyear anniversary\nof the date of grant and the next annual meeting of stockholders\nwhich is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding\nyear\u2019s\nannual meeting, (iii) shares of Citi common stock delivered in\nlieu of fully vested cash obligations, and (iv) any additional\nawards the\nCompensation Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five\npercent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for\nissuance under the\n2019 Plan.

In the case of an\naward subject to a performance condition, the applicable\nperformance condition may include one or more of the following\nperformance conditions\nand be expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or\nrelative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product\ngrowth, net income (pre- or after-tax),earnings, earnings per\nshare, stockholders\u2019 equity or\nreturn on stockholders\u2019 equity, assets or return on assets,\nreturn on risk-adjusted assets, capital or return on capital,\nreturn on risk capital, return on tangible common equity, book\nvalue or bookvalue per share, tangible\nbook value per share, economic value-added models or equivalent\nmetrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income, expenses or\nreengineering\nsavings, margins, cash flow or cash flow per share, stock price,\ntotal stockholder return, market share, debt reduction, net\npromoter scores, operating efficiency ratios, expense ratios,\nliquidityratios, regulatory achievements,\nor any objective or subjective performance conditions selected\nby the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to the amendment\ndescribed in Proposal\n4, the Compensation Committee may make equitable adjustments to\nany performance condition to the extent needed or appropriate to\nprevent the enlargement or diminution of the rights of\nparticipants; provided that in the event of a change of control,\nsuch adjustment(s) must be made at the time of grant, or prior\nto, or coincident with, the change of control.\n\nProhibition against repricing. The 2019 Plan\nprohibits any action under the 2019 Plan that would constitute a\n\u201crepricing\u201d of any outstanding option or SAR granted under\nthe 2019 Plan, the 2014 Plan, the 2009 Plan or any other plan of\nthe Company or of any acquired company, except with the approval\nof the\nstockholders of the Company. The 2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d\nto mean: (i) any action that constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d\nunder GAAP or the rules of the NYSE (including any modification\nor amendment to an outstanding option or SAR that has the effect\nof reducing\nits exercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding\noption or SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market\nvalue in exchange\nfor cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in exchange\nfor a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a\nsubstitution\nof a stock award for an option or SAR when its exercise price\nexceeds fair market value; in each case other than a permitted\nequitable\nadjustment.\n\nProhibition of reload options.The 2019 Plan does not permit the\ngrant of \u201creload\u201d options.\n\nRepayment obligation; right of set-off. If the Compensation\nCommittee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting\nand payment of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an\noption\nor SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation Committee\nmay cancel such vesting or exercise and refuse to issue shares\nand immediately\nterminate the participant\u2019s rights with respect to such award\n(or improperly vested portion thereof). If the vesting or\nexercise\nof any such award (or portion thereof) has already been settled\nby delivery of shares or cash, the participant shall be\nobligated, upon\ndemand, to return the shares or cash (or higher value received\nat vesting or exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any\nshares or cash\nwithheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations.\nConsistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal\nRevenue Code,\nthe 2019 Plan also provides for (a) the set-off of vested awards\nagainst obligations a participant may owe to Citi, including but\nnot\nlimited to the obligation to repay improperly vested or\nexercised awards, and (b) the set-off of any amount recovered by\na participant,\nand to be paid by the Company, in the nature of severance pay or\ncompensation for hypothetical or potential future services in\nconnection\nwith any legal claim or action alleging violation of law\nrelating to the participant\u2019s employment or termination thereof\n(whether\nby reason of a decision or settlement of such claim) against the\npretax amount the Company was required to pay for the\nparticipant\u2019s\naccount, including legal fees, in connection with such claim or\naction. Any failure to timely pay tax-related obligations owed\nto Citi\nin connection with an award may result in its cancellation.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                                                                \n  120  Proposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the        \n       Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan                      \n                                                                \nNon-transferability. During the vesting period, awards\nand sale-restricted shares generally are not transferable other\nthan by will or the laws of descent and distribution.\n\nAdjustments.The 2019 Plan provides that\nthe Compensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable\nadjustments to the maximum number of shares available for grant\nunder the\n2019 Plan and to the annual individual award limits expressed in\nnumbers of shares in the event of any changes to the Company\u2019s\ncapital structure, including a change in the number of shares\noutstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock split,\nreverse stock\nsplit, spinoff or any similar equity restructuring, or any\ncombination or exchange of equity securities, merger,\nconsolidation, recapitalization,\nreorganization, or similar transaction or event affecting Citi\u2019s\ncapitalization. In the event of any such transaction or event,\nor any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other\ndistribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to\nstockholders, the\nCompensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable\nadjustments to the number or kind of shares subject to\noutstanding awards, or\nthe exercise prices of outstanding options and SARs, to the\nextent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of\nparticipants\u2019\nrights.\n\nChange of control. The Compensation Committee may,\nwhen an award is made, or at any time prior to, or coincident\nwith, a \u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined below), provide for\nthe adjustment of performance conditions to prevent the\nenlargement or diminution of participants\u2019 rights, provide for\nthe cancellation\nof outstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring\nentity (or the surviving or acquiring entity\u2019s parent company)\nreplaces\nthe awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value,\nprovide for the acceleration of any time periods or the waiver\nof any other\nconditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an\naward upon an involuntary termination of a participant\u2019s\nemployment\nas a result of a change of control, or provide for the purchase\nof any award. Pursuant to the amendments described in Proposal\n4, the\nCompensation Committee would no longer be able to take such\naction after the time of a change of control, and the\nCompensation Committee\nwould be limited to only making adjustment(s) of performance\nconditions to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or\ndiminution\nof participants\u2019 rights. The vesting, payment, purchase, or\ndistribution of an award, however, may not be accelerated by\nreason\nof a change of control for any participant unless the\nparticipant\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated as a result\nof the change\nof control. For these purposes, a termination of employment as a\nresult of a change of control means involuntary termination of\nemployment\nother than for \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on\nor prior to the first anniversary of, the change of control.\n\nThe 2019 Plan defines a \u201cchange of control\u201d to\nmean (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial\nownership of Citigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more\nof the combined\nvoting power of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.;\n(ii) specified changes in the majority of the Board (not\nincluding the\nelection of Directors whose election or nomination was approved\nby a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a sale,\ntransfer, or\ndistribution of all or substantially all of the assets of\nCitigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of Citigroup\nInc.; or (iv) consummation\nof a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate\ntransaction that results in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not\nowning more\nthan 50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other\ncorporation resulting from the transaction.\n\nTax withholding.Citi retains the right to deduct or withhold, or\nrequire the participant to remit to his or her employer,an\namount sufficient\nto satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign taxes (including\nhypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-equalized expatriates)\nrequired\nby law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable\nevent as a result of the 2019 Plan.\n\nVoting.The 2019 Plan provides that unless the Compensation\nCommittee determines otherwise, participants who receive issued\nand outstanding shares of Citi common stock that are subject to\ncontinuing\nrestrictions pursuant the terms of a stock award are generally\nentitled to direct the voting of the shares underlying their\nawards on\nmatters submitted to a vote of stockholders. All shares\nunderlying such awards as to which no voting instructions are\nreceived are voted\nproportionately, based on the voting instructions received with\nrespect to all other such shares.\n\nAmendment, termination and governing law.The 2019 Plan may be\namended, suspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee\nat any time, provided that no amendment\nshall be made without stockholder approval if it would\nmaterially increase the number of shares available under the\n2019 Plan (other\nthan in connection with an\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                                                          \n  Proposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the  121  \n  Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan                     \n                                                          \nequitable adjustment), materially\nexpand the types of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the\nclass of persons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan,\nmaterially\nextend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method\nof determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted\nunder the\n2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against \u201crepricing,\u201d\nor otherwise require approval by stockholders in order to\ncomply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or\nprincipal national securities exchange upon which Citi\u2019s common\nstock is\ntraded or quoted). Effective as of January 1, 2025, the 2019\nPlan and all agreements evidencing awards granted under the 2019\nPlan are\ngoverned by the laws of the State of Delaware.\n\nAward modification.The Compensation Committee retains\nthe right to modify outstanding awards without a participant\u2019s\nprior consent if it determines that the modification is required\nto comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory\nguidance (including applicable tax law). Subject to certain\nexceptions, any other modifications, if adverseto a participant,\nshall not be effective without the participant\u2019s\nwritten consent.\n\nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the principal\nU.S. federal income tax consequences relating to stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, based on current U.S. federal\nincome tax laws.\nThis summary does not constitute tax advice and, among other\nthings, does not describe state, local, or foreign tax\nconsequences, which\nmay be substantially different.\n\nGenerally, a participant will not recognize taxable\nincome on the grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a\nstock option, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an\namount\nequal to the difference between the fair market value of the\nCiti common stock received on the date of exercise and the\noption cost (number\nof shares purchased multiplied by the exercise price per share).\nThe participant will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise\nof the\noption even though the shares acquired may be subject to further\nrestrictions on sale or transferability. Citi will ordinarily be\nentitled\nto a deduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the\namount of ordinary income recognized by the participant upon\nexercise, except\nas may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue\nCode. Generally, upon a subsequent sale of shares acquired in an\noption\nexercise, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost\nbasis of the shares sold will be taxable as a capital gain or\nloss, including\nany sale of shares freed from sale restrictions to fund the\npayment of taxes incurred at exercise. The 2019 Plan does not\nprovide for\nawards of \u201cincentive stock options,\u201d which have different tax\nconsequences under the Internal Revenue Code.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n       \n  122  \n       \nStockholder Proposals\n\nCiti makes every effort to be responsive to concerns expressed\nby our stockholders by engaging in dialogues, participating in\nissuer/investor\nworking groups, and adopting policies or initiatives we believe\nto be in the best interests of all stockholders. Over the years,\nCiti\nhas met with several proponents and other interested parties\nregarding such issues as proxy access, human rights, climate\nchange, net\nzero, risk management, auditor rotation, trade association\npayments, diversity and inclusion risks, and viewpoint\ndiversity, among others,\nand has, on certain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in\nresponse to these engagements and/or stockholder votes. We\nencourage our\nstockholders to communicate with management and the Board.

McIntosh, at 388 Greenwich\nStreet, New York, New York 10013.\n\nProposal 5\n\nJohn Chevedden has submitted the following proposal\nfor consideration at the 2025 Annual Meeting.\n    Proposal 5 \u2013 Shareholder Vote regarding Excessive Golden    \n                           Parachutes                           \nShareholders request that the Board seek shareholder\napproval of any senior manager\u2019s new or renewed pay package that\nprovides for severance or termination payments with an estimated\nvalue exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive\u2019s base\nsalary plus target short-term bonus. This proposal only applies\nto the\nNamed Executive Officers. This provision shall at least be\nincluded in the Governess Guidelines of the Company or similar\ndocument and\nbe readily accessible on the Company website.\n\n\u201cSeverance or termination payments\u201d include\ncash, equity or other pay that is paid out or vests due to a\nsenior executive\u2019s termination for any reason. Payments include\nthose\nprovided under employment agreements, severance plans, and\nchange-in-control clauses in long-term equity plans, but not\nlife insurance,\npension benefits, or deferred compensation earned and vested\nprior to termination.\n\n\u201cEstimated total value\u201d includes: lump-sum\npayments; payments offsetting tax liabilities, perquisites or\nbenefits not vested under a plan generally available to\nmanagement employees,\npost-employment consulting fees or office expense and equity\nawards if vesting is accelerated, or a performance condition\nwaived, due\nto termination.\n\nThe Board shall retain the option to seek shareholder\napproval after material terms are agreed upon.\n\nUnfortunately some companies only limit cash golden\nparachutes to the 2.99 figure which means that there is no limit\non non cash golden parachutes for which shareholders have no\nvoting power.\n\nThis proposal is relevant even if there are current\ngolden parachute limits. A limit on golden parachutes is like a\nspeed limit. A speed limit by itself does not guarantee that the\nspeed\nlimit will never be exceeded. Like this proposal the rules\nassociated with a speed limit provide consequences if the limit\nis exceeded.\nWith this proposal the consequences are a non-binding\nshareholder vote is required for unreasonably rich golden\nparachutes.\n\nThis proposal places no limit on long-term equity pay\nor any other type pay. This proposal thus has no impact on the\nability to attract executive talent and does not discourage the\nuse of\nlong-term equity pay because it places no limit on golden\nparachutes. It simply requires that overly rich golden\nparachutes be subject\nto a non-binding shareholder vote at a shareholder meeting\nalready scheduled for other matters.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  123  \n                              \nThis proposal is relevant because the annual say\non executive pay vote does not have a separate section for\napproving or rejecting golden parachutes.\n\nThis proposal topic also received between 51% and 65% support\nat:\nFedEx (FDX)\nSpirit AeroSystems (SPR)\nAlaska Air (ALK)\nAbbVie (ABBV)\nFiserv (FISV)\n                        Please vote yes:                        \n                                                                \n    Shareholder Vote regarding Excessive Golden Parachutes \u2013    \n                           Proposal 5                           \nManagement Comment\nSummary\nCiti has appropriate policies in\nplace to guard against excessive severance arrangements. As\nstated on pages 96-97, Citi\u2019s executive officers are not\nentitled\nto severance pay upon termination of employment in excess of\nbroad-based benefits. In the U.S., those benefits are capped at\n$500,000. Moreover, since 2002 Citi has been prohibited without\nthe approval of its stockholders from entering into an\nemployment\nagreement with an executive officer that provides, upon a\ntermination of employment following a change in control, cash\npayments in\nexcess of three times the executive officer\u2019s taxable income.\nCiti\u2019s executive officers do not have special agreements\ncovering their compensation in the event of a change in control.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Compensation Philosophy\nand Incentive Compensation Policy provide that incentive\ncompensation at Citi is intended to incentivize appropriate risk\nand control\nbehavior and outcomes, and to be compliant with applicable laws,\nregulations and regulatory guidance. Applicable regulatory\nguidance specifically\ncautions financial institutions that \u201cin all cases, a banking\norganization should ensure that the structure and terms of any\ngolden\nparachute arrangement entered into by the organization\u201d are\nappropriate from a safety and soundness perspective.\n\nFurthermore, as a matter of internal governance,\nthe Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee\nof Citi\u2019s Board is authorized and required to \u201creview and\napprove\nthe material terms of employment and retention agreements\n(including offer letters), severance arrangements, change in\ncontrol agreements,\nand any special supplemental benefits for executive officers and\nmembers of the Executive Management Team,\u201d as stated in the\nCommittee\u2019s\nCharter. That requirement evidences the priority given by the\nCommittee to not allow excessive severance benefits.\n\nHowever, Citi\u2019s management must also have\nthe flexibility to tailor compensation, which may include\nseverance provisions, to attract and retain talent in highly\ncompetitive markets,\nincluding in light of rules in the many jurisdictions around the\nworld in which we operate. Rather than giving Citi\u2019s management\nappropriate flexibility, the Proposal gives rise to ambiguity\nand inconsistencies. Were the Proposal to be adopted, the\nambiguities and\ninconsistencies in the Proposal could be highly problematic.\n\nSpecifically, the Proposal uses off-the-shelf language\nnot tailored to Citi\u2019s business and circumstances.\n\nFor example, the Proposal would require severance\npayments to be limited to 2.99 times the sum of the executive\u2019s\nbase salary plus target short-term bonus, but Citi does not use\nshort-term target bonuses in its compensation program. In the\nabsence of target bonuses, the Proposal could be interpreted to\nrequire\nthat the Board limit severance payments to 2.99 times base\nsalary alone, which is inconsistent with Citi\u2019s business needs.\n\nFinally, the Proposal could restrict payments required\nby foreign laws (in the case of non-U.S. executives), as well as\npayments under various benefit plans not generally understood to\nconstitute\nseverance or termination pay.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  124  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     The Proposal is not necessary to ensure that Citi does     \n  \u00d8  not                                                        \n     pay excessive severance benefits, as Citi has adequate     \n     policies in place to guard against that risk:              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     As stated on pages 96-97, Citi\u2019s executive officers        \n  \u00fc  are not entitled to severance pay upon termination of      \n     employment in excess of broad-based benefits.              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s compensation practices are governed by its          \n     Compensation                                               \n     Philosophy and Incentive Compensation Policy, which        \n     requires Citi to adopt compensation practices that comply  \n  \u00fc  with U.S. and global bank                                  \n     regulatory requirements.

As\ndetailed in our 2023 Proxy Statement and as noted in our 2024\nProxy Statement, we have been, and continue to be, concerned\nabout misstatements made in this and previous versions of this\nProposal regarding our financing activities.\n\nIn April 2024, Citi published a comprehensive report\ntitled Respecting the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which\noutlines our policies and practices related to Indigenous\nPeoples\u2019\nrights. This report summarizes our due diligence procedures,\nexplains how we identify potential risks associated with\nIndigenous Peoples\nin financed projects and general client relationships, how we\nevaluate our clients\u2019 actions to avoid, minimize and mitigate\nsuch\nrisks, and discloses the number of transactions flagged by our\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) team in 2023\nthat required\nenhanced due diligence. We also describe the difference between\nvarious financial products, with project-related loan structures\ngiving\nlenders more access to information, more ability to engage\nindependent consultants, and the opportunity to negotiate loan\ncovenants requiring\nspecific actions of clients as a condition of financing. This\nallows for more effective evaluation and management of potential\nrisks to\nIndigenous Peoples in project-related loans, as opposed to\ngeneral corporate relationships, where our ability to conduct\ndue diligence\nand influence client activities is more limited. This report\ndemonstrates our commitment to transparency and accountability,\naddressing\nthe concerns raised by the Proponent.\n\nOur ESRM Policy lies at the core of our strategy\nfor addressing risks to Indigenous Peoples arising from our\nclients\u2019 activities. This policy is informed by key\ninternational environmental\nand social standards, such as the United Nations Guiding\nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles),\nthe Equator\nPrinciples and the World Bank\u2019s International Finance\nCorporation Performance Standards. Specific \u201cAreas of High\nCaution\u201d\noutlined in Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy \u2014 including potential risks to\nIndigenous Peoples \u2014 require enhanced due diligence, thorough\nrisk assessment, and proactive client engagement as appropriate.\nCiti proceeds with such transactions only after a thorough and\njudicious\nassessment of those risks and associated impacts, reflecting how\nwe take seriously the responsibility to respect human rights as\noutlined\nin the UN Guiding Principles.\n                                                                \n     See                                                        \n  1  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Cit\u2026  \n     page 127.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     See                                                        \n  2  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Cit\u2026  \n     page 128.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  See                                                        \n     https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/202\u2026  \n                                                                \nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Industry Leadership in Human Rights Disclosures: Citi      \n     has a strong record of leadership in the financial sector  \n     regarding human rights disclosures. In 2007, we were the   \n     first major U.S. bank                                      \n  \u00d8  to publish a Human Rights Statement, publicly affirming    \n     our commitment to uphold the fundamental human rights      \n     outlined in the UN Universal                               \n     Declaration of Human Rights and the core conventions of    \n     the International Labour Organization.                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Pioneering UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework       \n     Adoption:                                                  \n     In 2016, Citi became the first U.S. bank to use the UN     \n     Guiding Principles Reporting Framework to disclose our     \n  \u00d8  salient human rights risks,                                \n     how these impact stakeholders, and how these risks are     \n     integrated into our ESRM Policy as \u201cAreas of High          \n     Caution\u201d to trigger                                        \n     additional due diligence \u2014 including specific              \n     considerations for Indigenous Peoples.                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Strengthened Due Diligence on Indigenous Peoples\u2019          \n     Rights: In 2018, we reinforced our commitment to           \n     Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights by updating our \u201cAreas of High  \n     Caution\u201d                                                   \n     on Indigenous Peoples to state that globally, in           \n  \u00d8  project-related lending with certain defined impacts on    \n     Indigenous Peoples, Citi expects                           \n     clients to have engaged in meaningful consultations with   \n     potentially affected Indigenous Peoples with the goal of   \n     achieving Free, Prior                                      \n     and Informed Consent (FPIC).                               \n                                                                \nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  127  \n                              \n                                                                \n     Ongoing Commitment to Transparency: Citi has worked        \n     to understand and address the most salient human rights    \n     risks associated with our business, including those        \n  \u00d8  affecting Indigenous Peoples.                              \n     Our disclosures exemplify our dedication to transparency   \n     and proactive risk management to protect our investors     \n     and stakeholders.                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Direct Client Engagement: Citi engages clients when        \n     potential risks to Indigenous Peoples are identified. The  \n     ESRM team compiles due diligence questions for engagement  \n     and information gathering                                  \n     with the client to understand their approach to community  \n     engagement and their respect for Indigenous Peoples\u2019       \n     rights. When relevant,                                     \n     we make recommendations to the client on improvements to   \n  \u00d8  policies and practices to strengthen respect for           \n     Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights.                                \n     Based on the risks identified and the client\u2019s actions to  \n     avoid, minimize and mitigate such risks, the Citi ESRM     \n     team determines                                            \n     whether the transaction or client relationship aligns      \n     with the Citi ESRM Policy, and whether ongoing monitoring  \n     is required.

The\nIEA urges no\ninvestment in new fossil supply projects to achieve net zero:\n\u201cAs a share of total energy supply, [fossil fuels] fall from 80%\nin\n2020 to just over 20% in 2050.\u201d\n\nIn line with such assumptions, and similar assumptions\nincluded in the IPCC\u2019s report series and elsewhere, Citigroup\nInc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) has adopted net-zero\ncommitments that include \u201cour financed emissions target by 2050\nand our operational footprint emissions target by 2030,\u201d\nincluding\n\u201ca goal of $1 trillion in sustainable finance.\u201d In fact, the\nCompany apparently intends to push clients to decarbonize,\nincluding issuing thinly-veiled threats to debank clients who\ndon\u2019t sufficiently embrace the Company\u2019s climate agenda.\n\nThese investment decisions presume the normative\nIEA NZE is possible and is based on true assumptions, but it is\nunclear what, if any, analysis the Company has done to protect\ncompany\nassets and investments should NZE prove unsound.\n\nA 2023 study by the Energy Policy\nResearch Foundation (EPRF) found that net zero advocates have\nmisconstrued the IEA\u2019s position on new oil and gas investment,\nand that the IEA has made questionable assumptions and\nmilestones for NZE about government policies, energy and carbon\nprices,\nbehavioral changes, economic growth, and technology maturity.\n\nThe EPRF study found, \u201cOil and gas play irreplaceable\nroles in modem civilization that are not reproducible with low-\ncarbon alternatives. The attempt to substitute them with\ninferior, less\nefficient, energy sources will have enormous micro- and\nmacroeconomic consequences and profound geopolitical\nimplications.\u201d\n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  128  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nNZE advocates speak in terms of fossil fuels as\n\u201cstranded assets,\u201d but no consideration has been given to\nwhether the true stranded assets might be the assets spent on\nexpensive\nrenewable energy options based on faulty assumptions. Should the\nEPRF\u2019s study prove true, our Company stands to lose on its\nrenewable\nenergy investments, subsequently incurring the costs of\nreverting back to embracing reliable energy sources such as\ncoal. Additionally,\nit appears that most countries are not really going to outlaw\nreliable and affordable energy, further making current net-zero\nstranded-asset\ntheory non-sensical.\n\nResolved:\nShareholders request that the Company\u2019s Board seek an audited\nreport assessing how applying the findings of the Energy Policy\nResearch\nFoundation and similar studies would affect the assumptions,\ncosts, estimates, and valuations underlying its financial\nstatements, including\nthose related to long-term commodity and carbon prices,\nremaining asset lives, future asset retirement obligations,\ncapital expenditures\nand impairments.

It details expectations around governance, policies,\nprocedures and limits, strategic planning, risk management,\ndata, risk measurement, and reporting and scenario analysis.\n\nWith regard to strategic planning, it notes, \u201cThe\nboard should consider material climate-related financial risk\nexposures when setting and monitoring the financial\ninstitution\u2019s\noverall business strategy, risk appetite, and when overseeing\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of capital plans. As part of\nforward-looking\nstrategic planning, the board should consider and management\nshould address the potential impact of material climate-related\nfinancial\nrisk exposures on the financial institution\u2019s financial\ncondition, operations (including geographic locations), and\nbusiness objectives\nover various time horizons.\u201d\n\nAs such, Citi collects information from a number\nof sources in order to synthesize a wide range of opinions and\nexpertise, which then informs our opinion on the range of\npossible outcomes.\nWe are also required to perform scenario analyses, including\nboth regulatory-defined and internally developed scenarios that\naim to highlight\nextreme but plausible outcomes that we must manage risk against\nto work to ensure our safety and soundness in a range of\npossible outturns.\n\nAdditionally, in order to be responsive to our clients\u2019\nneeds, we aim to listen to and understand their requirements and\nbalance that, as we do for other risks faced, against being\noverly concentrated\nand therefore exposed to outcomes that may be adverse to us and\nthreaten our financial stability.\n\nOur comprehensive approach to\nmanaging these risks is detailed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, our net-zero commitment has deepened client\nengagement and positioned Citi to capitalize on financing\nopportunities related to the energy transition.

It is also impossible to assess\nfuture\nrisk without the disclosure of the right information.\u201d\n\nTo minimize these risks, some banks are taking animal\nwelfare issues into account as part of their lending due\ndiligence practices.\n\nHowever, Citi\u2019s oversight on animal welfare\nis miniscule, at best. Citi\u2019s Environmental and Social Policy\nFramework discusses due diligence regarding financing that\npotentially\nimpacts critical habitat and areas of high conservation value,\nand \u201ctraceability\u201d in beef supply chains. However,\nthis due diligence is limited to \u201careas of high caution\u201d and\n\u201csensitive ecoregions\u201d, failing to address the welfare\nof animals involved.\n\nHowever, consideration for biodiversity and habitat loss in\nsensitive ecoregions does not equate to consideration for animal\nwelfare.\n\nWhile Citi states, \u201cNature and the climate\nare inextricably linked and it is critical that we understand\nthis dynamic interplay,\u201d the scrutiny intensifies as Citi\nis recently identified as one of the top 3 financiers of factory\nfarming \u2013 providing approximately 18% of all loans and\nunderwriting services to companies tied to factory farms!!\n\nFactory farming is associated with not only animal\ncruelty, but also pollution, poor working conditions, resource\ndepletion, biodiversity loss, disease, food insecurity and\npoverty, and\nclimate change.\n\nFurther, \u201canimal welfare\u201d\nis absent from Citi\u2019s reports, policies, or governance\ndocuments.\n\nIncreasingly, banks are adopting exclusionary criteria\nto reduce exposure to animal cruelty and associated risks. Yet\nCiti earns a score of \u201c0\u201d on Banksforanimals.org for apparent\ndeficiencies in key areas regarding animal welfare.\n\nSimply because a process is not disclosed, does not\nnecessarily indicate a lack of due diligence. However,\nneglecting to publicly acknowledge oversight on animal welfare\nrisks the perception\nof our company\u2019s failure of oversight on critical issues.\nPublicly asserting how Citigroup addresses the issue of animal\nwelfare\nwhen considering financing decisions would not only increase\ntransparency but enhance Citi\u2019s overall reputation.\n\nResolved:\nShareholders request that Citigroup publish a report at\nreasonable expense and excluding proprietary and privileged\ninformation, disclosing\nwhether and how the Board of Directors exercises its oversight\nregarding material risks associated with animal welfare.\n                                                                \n  1  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-ani\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  2  https://www.openinvest.com/articles-insights/support-ani\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Env\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  4  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Glo\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  5  https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/202\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  6  https://www.americanbanker.com/news/activists-to-jpmorga\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2022/03/15/it-may-be-un\u2026  \n  7  industry-and-zero-                                         \n     waste#:~:text=Raising%20livestock%20for%20human%20consum\u2026  \n     water%20pollution.                                         \n                                                                \n                                               \n  8  https://www.ciwf.org.uk/factory-farming/  \n                                               \n                                                                \n  9  https://www.aspca.org/protecting-farm-animals/problem-fa\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  10  https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2024/10/09/factory-fa\u2026  \n      america/#:~:text=Factory%20farms%20tend%20to%20make,pop\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                           \n  11  https://banksforanimals.org/institutions/citigroup/  \n                                                           \nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  131  \n                              \nManagement Comment\nSummary\nThe Proposal requests that Citi publish a report\ndisclosing whether and how the Board of Directors exercises its\noversight regarding material risks associated with animal\nwelfare. The\nSupporting Statement expresses a concern that \u201canimal welfare\nissues present material financial, operational, and reputational\nrisks\nfor companies that receive financing from Citigroup, and to\nCitigroup as their financier.\u201d\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors provides oversight\nof Citi\u2019s work to identify, assess and integrate sustainability-\nrelated risks and opportunities. Moreover, our internal risk\nmanagement\nprocesses are designed to help us understand a broad array of\nkey risks associated with our activities and with our clients.\nCiti\u2019s\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework details the\nprinciples used to support consistent risk management across the\norganization.\nRisks related to wildlife, such as threats to biodiversity and\nflora and fauna, have been incorporated in our Environmental and\nSocial\nRisk Management (ESRM) Policy when relevant from a risk\nmanagement perspective. Separately, a number of our clients in\ncertain sectors\nhave voluntarily committed to good practices related to animal\nwelfare, such as the \u201cFive Freedoms\u201d of animal welfare.\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     ESRM Policy: Under Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy, there               \n     are certain \u201cAreas of High Caution,\u201d such as risks to      \n     biodiversity, that require special attention, focus and    \n     respect. In                                                \n     addition, Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy includes prohibitions on      \n  \u00d8  doing business with companies when our due diligence       \n     indicates that they are                                    \n     active in production or trade in wildlife or products      \n     regulated under the Convention on International Trade in   \n     Endangered Species of Wild                                 \n     Fauna and Flora, or drift net fishing in the marine        \n     environment using nets in excess of 2.5 km in length.      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Strong Governance and Regular Monitoring of Emerging       \n     Risks:                                                     \n     Citi regularly monitors emerging environmental and other   \n     risks and engages with clients and stakeholders on         \n     relevant issues related to                                 \n     biodiversity. The Board receives regular updates from      \n     Citi\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer and the Head of        \n  \u00d8  Climate Risk to ensure                                     \n     comprehensive oversight of our risk management approach.   \n     Should animal welfare-related risks become material to     \n     Citi\u2019s operations                                          \n     or clients, our existing stakeholder engagement and risk   \n     management processes would enable us to identify,          \n     evaluate and address these                                 \n     risks accordingly.                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Sustainable Finance: Citi\u2019s sustainable finance            \n     activity includes sustainable agriculture and land use,    \n     such as work with clients in the agricultural tech space   \n     and alternative proteins.                                  \n     We provide detailed annual reporting on our sustainable    \n     finance activity, by product, environmental/social         \n     criteria, and region. As one                               \n     example of a sustainable finance transaction related to    \n  \u00d8  sustainable agriculture, in 2023, Citi provided a letter   \n     of credit to the EVERY                                     \n     Company, the developer of the world\u2019s first animal-free    \n     egg protein and pepsin, to support the company\u2019s           \n     operations and growth.                                     \n     Using precision fermentation, the company created an       \n     alternative to conventional animal products, lessening     \n     land and water use alongside                               \n     greenhouse gas emissions.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Citi believes that the stockholder proposal is not  \n  necessary in light of the Board\u2019s existing          \n  oversight of Citi\u2019s risk framework and policies,    \n  including pursuant to Citi\u2019s Enterprise Risk        \n  Management Framework that drives board reporting    \n  on risk and related disclosures; therefore, the     \n  Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 8.    \n                                                      \n                                               www.citigroup.com\nTable of Contents\n                              \n  132  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nSubmission of Future Stockholder Proposals\n\nUnder SEC Rule 14a-8, a stockholder who intends\nto present a proposal at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders\nand who wishes the proposal to be included in the Proxy\nStatement for\nthat meeting must submit the proposal in writing to the\nCorporate Secretary of Citi at 388 Greenwich Street, New York,\nNew York 10013\nand send to the following email address:\nshareholderrelations@citi.com.

In addition to soliciting proxies by\nmail, Citi may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone,\nand\nsimilar means. No Director, officer, or employee of Citi will be\nspecially compensated for these activities. Citi also intends to\nrequest\nthat brokers, banks, and other nominees solicit proxies from\ntheir principals and will pay the brokers, banks, and other\nnominees certain\nexpenses they incur for such activities. Citi has retained\nMorrow Sodali LLC, a proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the\nsolicitation of\nproxies, for an estimated fee of $32,500 plus reimbursement of\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nHouseholding\n\nUnder SEC rules, a single set of Annual Reports\nand Proxy Statements or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials, as applicable, may be sent to any household at which\ntwo or\nmore stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the\nsame family. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate\nproxy card.\nThis procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume\nof duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces\nmailing and\nprinting expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain\nstockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report\nand Proxy\nStatement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials,\nas applicable, will be sent to that address unless any\nstockholder at\nthat address requested multiple sets of documents be sent.\nHowever, if any stockholder who agreed to householding wishes to\nreceive a\nseparate Annual Report or Proxy Statement, he or she may\ntelephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to Broadridge\nFinancial Services,\nInc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY\n11717. Stockholders sharing an address who wish to receive a\nsingle set of\nreports may do so by contacting their banks or brokers, if they\nare beneficial holders, or by contacting Broadridge at the\naddress set\nforth above, if they are record holders.\n\nCiti 2025 Proxy Statement\n\nTable of Contents\n       \n  133  \n       \nAbout the 2025 Annual Meeting\n                                                                \n  Q:  Who is soliciting my vote?                                \n      The Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. is soliciting    \n  A:  your vote at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Citi\u2019s\u00a0           \n      stockholders.                                             \n  Q:  Where and when will the 2025 Annual Meeting take place?   \n      The Annual Meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m.     \n      E.T. on April 29, 2025 through a virtual meeting          \n      platform.
