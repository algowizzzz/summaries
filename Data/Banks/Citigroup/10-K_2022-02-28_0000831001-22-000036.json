In the\nfirst quarter of 2022, Citi\nwill revise its financial\nreporting structure to align\nwith these management\nreporting changes to enable\ninvestors and others to better\nunderstand the performance of\nCiti\u2019s businesses (see the\ntable below for additional\ninformation on the revised\nfinancial reporting\nstructure):\n\n\u2022 First, Citi is creating a\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement segment. It will\nconsist of two distinct\nreporting units: U.S. Personal\nBanking businesses and a\nGlobal Wealth Management\nbusiness, which will include\nthe private bank.\n\n\u2022 Second, with respect to\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) , Citi will begin\nreporting under three\nreporting units: Services ,\nBanking and Markets . Services\nwill include treasury and\ntrade solutions and securities\nservices, reflecting the\nimportance of these businesses\nto Citi\u2019s future.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Citi is creating\nLegacy Franchises , a segment\nthat will consist of all the\nbusinesses Citi intends to\nexit (see below), including\nits remaining Legacy Holdings\nassets.\n\nIn conjunction with the\nstrategic refresh, in 2021\nCiti announced that it will\nfocus its consumer banking\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA on\nfour wealth centers:\nSingapore, Hong Kong, the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) and\nLondon. As a result, Citi is\npursuing exits of its consumer\nfranchises in the remaining 13\nmarkets across these two\nregions.\n\nIn 2021 and early 2022, Citi\nannounced sale agreements for\nor exit of a majority of the\n13 markets (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and \u201c Asia GCB \u201d\nbelow). ICG will continue to\nserve clients, including its\ncommercial banking clients, in\nall of these markets.\n\nIn addition, in January 2022,\nCiti announced that it intends\nto exit the consumer, small\nbusiness and middle-market\nbanking operations of\nCitibanamex. The businesses in\nthe intended exit include the\nMexico consumer and small\nbusiness banking operations,\nreported as part of Citi\u2019s GCB\nsegment, as well as the Mexico\nmiddle-market banking\nbusiness, reported in Citi\u2019s\nICG segment.

Excluding\na pretax loss of approximately\n$0.7 billion (approximately\n$0.6 billion after-tax)\nrelated to Citi\u2019s agreement to\nsell its Australia consumer\nbanking business in Asia\nGlobal Consumer Banking (GCB)\n(see \u201cCitigroup\u201d below),\nCiti\u2019s revenues declined 4%,\nas strength in investment\nbanking, equity markets, the\nprivate bank and securities\nservices in Institutional\nClients Group (ICG) was more\nthan offset by normalization\nin market activity in fixed\nincome markets within ICG , as\nwell as the impact of lower\ndeposit spreads and card loans\nacross GCB .\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses included\npretax costs of approximately\n$1.2 billion ($1.1 billion\nafter-tax) primarily related\nto charges incurred from the\nvoluntary early retirement\nprogram (VERP) in connection\nwith the wind-down of the\nKorea consumer banking\nbusiness (for additional\ninformation, see \u201c Asia GCB \u201d\nbelow).\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to invest in\nits transformation, including\ninfrastructure supporting its\nrisk and control environment,\nand make business-led\ninvestments.\n\n\u2022 Citi had broad-based deposit\ngrowth across ICG and GCB (up\n3% and 5%, respectively),\nreflecting continued\nengagement across both\ncorporate and consumer\nclients.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned approximately\n$11.8 billion of capital to\nits common shareholders in the\nform of $4.2 billion in\ndividends and $7.6 billion in\ncommon share repurchases,\ntotaling approximately 105\nmillion common shares, while\nmaintaining robust regulatory\ncapital ratios.\n\n\u2022 In addition to the sale\nannouncements related to Asia\nGCB , Citi also announced it\nintends to exit the consumer,\nsmall business and middle-\nmarket banking operations of\nCitibanamex in Mexico. Citi\u2019s\nplanned divestitures of its\nconsumer businesses across\nMexico, Asia and EMEA are\naligned with the repositioning\nof its consumer operations to\nfocus on global wealth\ncenters, as well as payments\nand lending and a targeted\nretail presence in the U.S.\n(For additional information on\nthe exit markets and Citi\u2019s\nrevised reporting structure\neffective for the first\nquarter of 2022, see\n\u201cStrategic Refresh\u2014Market\nExits and Revised Reporting\nStrategy\u201d above and \u201c Latin\nAmerica GCB \u201d and \u201c Asia GCB \u201d\nbelow.)\n\nAlthough economic growth and\nemployment rates have\ncontinued to recover from\npandemic-related lows,\nparticularly in the U.S.,\nvarious macroeconomic and\nother challenges and\nuncertainties related to,\namong other things, the\nduration and\n\nseverity of the pandemic-\nrelated public health crisis,\ndisruptions of global supply\nchains, inflationary\npressures, increasing interest\nrates and geopolitical\ntensions involving Eastern\nEurope, will continue to\ncreate uncertainty around\nCiti\u2019s businesses and results.\n\nFor a discussion of trends,\nuncertainties and risks that\nwill or could impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition during 2022, see\n\u201c2021 Results Summary,\u201d \u201cRisk\nFactors,\u201d each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  2021 Results Summary                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $22.0 billion, or $10.14\nper share, compared to net\nincome of $11.0 billion, or\n$4.72 per share, in the prior\nyear. The increase in net\nincome was driven by lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nlower revenues. Citigroup\u2019s\neffective tax rate was 20%, up\nmodestly from 19% in the prior\nyear. Earnings per share\nincreased significantly,\nprimarily driven by net\nincome.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $71.9\nbillion decreased 5% from the\nprior year. Excluding the\nAustralia loss on sale,\nCitigroup revenues decreased\n4%, primarily driven by lower\nrevenues in both ICG and GCB ,\npartially offset by higher\nrevenues in Corporate/Other .\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\n2021 results include the\nimpacts of divestitures of\nCiti\u2019s consumer banking\nbusinesses in Asia . Reported\nrevenues include the Australia\nloss on sale (approximately\n$0.7 billion pretax, $0.6\nbillion after-tax), primarily\nreflecting the impact of a\ncurrency translation\nadjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) already reflected in\nthe Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI)\ncomponent of equity. Upon\nclosing, the CTA balance will\nbe removed from the AOCI\ncomponent of equity, resulting\nin a neutral impact to Citi\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital.\n\nReported expenses include the\nimpact of the Korea VERP of\napproximately $1.1 billion\n(approximately $0.8 billion\nafter-tax) and contract\nmodification costs related to\nthe Asia divestitures of\napproximately $119 million\n(approximately $98 million\nafter-tax).

The decreased\ncost of credit was driven by a\nnet ACL reserve release of\n$8.8 billion (versus a build\nof $9.8 billion in the prior\nyear) as well as lower net\ncredit losses. Citi\u2019s net ACL\nrelease primarily reflected\nimprovement in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook and\nportfolio credit quality. Citi\ncould experience higher credit\ncosts in 2022, as the level of\nACL releases from 2021 are\nunlikely to continue, and Citi\nexpects to build ACL reserves\nfor new lending volumes.\n\nFor further information on the\ndrivers of Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $4.9\nbillion declined 36% from the\nprior year. Consumer net\ncredit losses of $4.5 billion\ndecreased 32%, primarily\nreflecting lower loan volumes\nand improved delinquencies in\nthe North America cards\nportfolios.

   \n(1) Revenue previously referred to as net interest revenue is\nnow referred to as net interest income. During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, Citi reclassified deposit insurance expenses\nfrom Interest expense to Other operating expenses for all\nperiods presented. Amounts reclassified for each year were\n$1,207 million for 2021, $1,203 million for 2020, $781 million\nfor 2019, $1,182 million for 2018 and $1,249 million for 2017.\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(2) 2017 includes the one-time impact related to enactment of\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). 2020, 2019 and 2018\nreflect the tax rate structure post Tax Reform. RoTCE for 2017\nexcludes the one-time impact from Tax Reform and is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. For additional information, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and Significant Estimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d\nbelow.\n\n(3) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity. The return on\naverage total Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity is calculated using\nnet income divided by average Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For\ninformation on RoTCE and TBV, see \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Tangible\nCommon Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per\nShare and Returns on Equity\u201d below.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s risk-based capital and leverage ratios for 2017 are\nnon-GAAP financial measures, which reflect full implementation\nof regulatory capital adjustments and deductions prior to the\neffective date of January 1, 2018.\n\n(6) Citi\u2019s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1\nCapital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach, and the reportable Total Capital ratio was the lower\nderived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019 to 2017. Citi\u2019s\nreportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and\nTotal Capital ratios were the lower derived under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches framework as of December 31, 2020.\n\n(7) Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net\nincome per diluted share.\n\n(8) Total common dividends declared plus common share\nrepurchases as a percentage of net income available to common\nshareholders ( Net income , less preferred dividends).

ICG provided\ncorporate, institutional,\npublic sector and high-net-\nworth clients around the world\nwith a full range of wholesale\nbanking products and services,\nincluding fixed income and\nequity sales and trading,\nforeign exchange, prime\nbrokerage, derivative\nservices, equity and fixed\nincome research, corporate\nlending, investment banking\nand advisory services, private\nbanking, cash management,\ntrade finance and securities\nservices. ICG transacted with\nclients in both cash\ninstruments and derivatives,\nincluding fixed income,\nforeign currency, equity and\ncommodity products.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nplanned revision to its\nreporting structure, including\nthe reporting of the private\nbank as part of a new\nreporting segment, Personal\nBanking and Wealth Management\n, see \u201cStrategic\nRefresh\u2014Market Exits and\nPlanned Revision to Reporting\nStructure\u201d above.\n\nICG revenue is generated\nprimarily from fees and\nspreads associated with these\nactivities. ICG earns fee\nincome for assisting clients\nwith transactional services\nand clearing and providing\nbrokerage and investment\nbanking services and other\nsuch activities. Such fees are\nrecognized at the point in\ntime when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of\na contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically\nat the trade/execution date or\nclosing of a transaction.\nRevenue generated from these\nactivities is recorded in\nCommissions and fees and\nInvestment banking . Revenue\nis also generated from assets\nunder custody and\nadministration, which is\nrecognized as/when the\nassociated promised service is\nsatisfied, which normally\noccurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by\nthe customer and provided by\nCiti. Revenue generated from\nthese activities is primarily\nrecorded in Administration and\nother fiduciary fees . For\nadditional information on\nthese various types of\nrevenues, see Note 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nIn addition, as a market\nmaker, ICG facilitates\ntransactions, including\nholding product inventory to\nmeet client demand, and earns\nthe differential between the\nprice at which it buys and\nsells the products. These\nprice differentials and the\nunrealized gains and losses on\nthe inventory are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . Mark-\nto-market gains and losses on\ncertain credit derivatives\n(used to hedge the corporate\nloan portfolio) are also\nrecorded in Principal\ntransactions (for additional\ninformation on Principal\ntransactions revenue, see Note\n6 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). Other\nprimarily includes realized\ngains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt\nsecurities, gains and losses\non equity securities not held\nin trading accounts and other\nnon-recurring gains and\nlosses. Interest income earned\non assets held, less interest\npaid on long- and short-term\ndebt and to customers on\ndeposits, is recorded as Net\ninterest income .\n\nThe amount and types of\nMarkets revenues are impacted\nby a variety of interrelated\nfactors, including market\nliquidity; changes in market\nvariables such as interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates,\nequity prices, commodity\nprices and credit spreads, as\nwell as their implied\nvolatilities; investor\nconfidence and other\nmacroeconomic conditions.\nAssuming all other market\nconditions do not change,\nincreases in client activity\nlevels or bid/offer spreads\ngenerally result in increases\nin revenues. However, changes\nin market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client\nactivity levels, bid/offer\nspreads and the fair value of\nproduct inventory. For\nexample, a decrease in market\nliquidity may increase\nbid/offer spreads, decrease\nclient activity levels and\nwiden credit spreads on\nproduct inventory positions.\n\nICG \u2019s management of the\nMarkets businesses involves\ndaily monitoring and\nevaluation of the above\nfactors at the trading desk as\nwell as the country level.\n\nIn the Markets businesses,\nclient revenues are those\nrevenues directly attributable\nto client transactions at the\ntime of inception, including\ncommissions, interest or fees\nearned. Client revenues do not\ninclude the results of client\nfacilitation activities (e.g.,\nholding product inventory in\nanticipation of client demand)\nor the results of certain\neconomic hedging activities.\n\nICG \u2019s international presence\nis supported by trading floors\nin approximately 80 countries\nand a proprietary network in\n95 countries and\njurisdictions. At December 31,\n2021, ICG had $1.8 trillion in\nassets and $950 billion in\ndeposits. Securities services\nand issuer services managed\n$24.0 trillion in assets under\ncustody and administration at\nDecember 31, 2021, of which\nCiti provides both custody and\nadministrative services to\ncertain clients related to\n$1.9 trillion of such assets.\nManaged assets under trust\nwere $3.8 trillion at December\n31, 2021.

economically hedge a portion\nof the private bank and corporate loan portfolio that includes\nboth accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on\nloan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives\nand the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted\nagainst the private bank and corporate lending revenues to\nreflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan\nhedges include $(131) million and $(74) million related to the\ncorporate loan portfolio and $(13) million and $23 million\nrelated to the private bank for the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. All of gains (losses) on loan\nhedges are related to the corporate loan portfolio for the year\nended December 31, 2019. Citigroup\u2019s results of operations\nexcluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-\nGAAP financial measures.\n\n(2) 2019 includes an approximate $350 million gain on Citi\u2019s\ninvestment in Tradeweb.\n\n(3) Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses\nother than Markets , primarily treasury and trade solutions and\nthe private bank.\n\n(4) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue.

Banking\nrevenues were up 7% (both\nincluding and excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges), driven by higher\nrevenues in investment banking\nand the private bank,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in treasury and trade\nsolutions and corporate\nlending. Markets and\nsecurities services revenues\nwere down 11%, primarily\nreflecting a normalization in\nfixed income markets revenues,\npartially offset by growth in\nequity markets and securities\nservices.\n\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits markets and investment\nbanking businesses will\ncontinue to reflect the\noverall market environment\nduring 2022.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere up 30%, reflecting growth\nin the overall market wallet.\nAdvisory revenues increased\n78%, reflecting strength in\nNorth America and EMEA ,\ndriven by growth in the market\nwallet as well as wallet share\ngains. Equity underwriting\nrevenues increased 53%,\nreflecting strength in North\nAmerica and EMEA , driven by\ngrowth in the market wallet,\nas well as wallet share gains.\nDebt underwriting revenues\nincreased 3%, reflecting\nstrength in EMEA , as growth\nin the market wallet was\npartially offset by a decline\nin wallet share.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 4% (both\nincluding and excluding the\nimpact of FX translation),\nreflecting a decline in\nrevenues in the cash business,\npartially offset by an\nincrease in trade revenues.\nCash revenues decreased,\ndriven by the ongoing impact\nof lower deposit spreads. The\ndecrease was partially offset\nby strong growth in fee\nrevenues reflecting solid\nclient engagement and growth\nin transaction volumes,\nincluding growth in USD\nclearing, commercial cards and\ncross-border solutions. The\nincrease in trade revenues was\ndriven by improved trade\nspreads and growth in loans,\nreflecting an increase in\ntrade flows and originations,\nprimarily in Asia and EMEA .\nAverage trade loans increased\n5% (both including and\nexcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation).\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 3%, including the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof losses on loan hedges,\nrevenues decreased 1%, as\nlower cost of funds was more\nthan offset by lower loan\nvolumes, reflecting muted\ndemand given strong client\nliquidity positions. Average\nloans decreased 20% during the\ncurrent year.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 5%. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\nincreased 6%, driven by strong\nperformance in North America\nand EMEA . The higher revenues\nreflected continued momentum\nwith new and existing clients,\n\nresulting in higher loan\nvolumes and spreads, higher\nmanaged investments revenues\nand higher deposit volumes.\nThe increase in revenues was\npartially offset by lower\ndeposit spreads due to the\nongoing low interest rate\nenvironment and lower capital\nmarkets revenue.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 22%,\nreflecting lower revenues\nacross all regions, largely\ndriven by a comparison to a\nstrong prior year, as well as\na normalization in market\nactivity, particularly in\nrates and currencies, and\nspread products. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased, reflecting\nlower investor client activity\nacross rates and currencies\nand spread products. Net\ninterest income also\ndecreased, largely reflecting\na change in the mix of trading\npositions.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\ndecreased 27%, driven by the\nnormalization in market\nactivity, and a comparison to\na strong prior year that\nincluded elevated levels of\nvolatility related to the\npandemic. Spread products and\nother fixed income revenues\ndecreased 11%, driven by a\ncomparison to a strong prior\nyear and the normalization in\nmarket activity, particularly\nin flow trading and structured\nproducts, reflecting lower\nvolatility and spreads,\npartially offset by strong\nsecuritization activity.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 25%, driven by\ngrowth across all products.\nEquity derivatives revenues\nincreased reflecting higher\nclient activity, particularly\nin EMEA and North America .\nPrime finance revenues\nincreased due to favorable\nmarket conditions as well as\ngrowth in client balances.\nCash equities revenues\nincreased modestly, reflecting\nhigher client activity. Non-\ninterest revenues increased,\nprimarily due to higher\nprincipal transactions\nrevenues, reflecting higher\nclient activity.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 6%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues increased 7%, as an\nincrease in fee revenues with\nboth new and existing clients,\ndriven by growth in assets\nunder custody and settlement\nvolumes, was partially offset\nby lower deposit spreads.\n\nExpenses were up 8%, primarily\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and higher\nincentive compensation, as\nwell as transactional related\nexpenses, partially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $2.9 billion compared to\ncosts of $5.6 billion in the\nprior year, driven by an ACL\nrelease and lower net credit\nlosses.\n\nNet credit losses declined to\n$396 million from $987 million\nin the prior year, driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality.\n\nThe ACL release was $3.3\nbillion compared to a build of\n$4.6 billion in the prior\nyear. The release was\nprimarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality as well as\nCiti\u2019s improved macroeconomic\noutlook.

billion,\ncompared to a net loss of $46\nmillion in the prior year,\nreflecting significantly lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by lower revenues and\nhigher expenses.\n\nRevenues decreased

under\nmanagement (increase of 8%,\nreflecting favorable market\nconditions and strong client\nengagement) was more than\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads, as well as lower\nmortgage revenues. Average\ndeposits increased 17%, driven\nby higher levels of consumer\nliquidity due to government\nstimulus, as well as continued\nstrategic efforts to drive\norganic growth.\n\nCards revenues decreased 10%.\nBranded cards revenues\ndecreased 7%, primarily driven\nby continued higher payment\nrates, reflecting increased\ncustomer liquidity from\ngovernment stimulus and relief\nprograms, partially offset by\nhigher spending-related\nrevenues. Credit card spend\nvolume increased 21%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven low\nlevels in the prior year.\n\nRetail services revenues\ndecreased 15%, primarily\ndriven by lower average loans\n(down 7%), reflecting higher\npayment rates from the\nincreased customer liquidity\nfrom government stimulus and\nrelief programs, as well as\nhigher partner payments,\nreflecting higher income\nsharing as a result of lower\nnet credit losses. For\nadditional information on\npartner payments, see Note 5\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Credit card spend\nvolume increased 18%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven low\nlevels in the prior year.\n\nExpenses increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nbusiness-led investments and\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $1.0 billion, compared to\ncosts of $9.1 billion in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby a net ACL release compared\nto a net ACL build in the\nprior year, as well as lower\nnet credit losses. Net credit\nlosses decreased 41%,\nconsisting of lower net credit\nlosses in both branded cards\n(down 39% to $1.7 billion) and\nretail services (down 46% to\n$1.2 billion), primarily\ndriven by lower loan volumes\nand improved delinquencies,\nprimarily as a result of the\nhigher payment rates.\n\nThe net ACL release was $4.0\nbillion, compared to a net\nbuild of $4.1 billion in the\nprior year, reflecting\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality and the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook.

Average\nloans decreased 13%,\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity.\nAssets under management\nincreased 8%, reflecting\nfavorable market conditions,\nas well as strong client\nengagement.\n\nCards revenues decreased 21%,\nprimarily driven by lower\naverage loans (down 11%),\nreflecting higher payment\nrates. Credit card spend\nvolume increased 16%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven low\nlevels in the prior year.\n\nExpenses decreased 2%, as\nproductivity savings more than\noffset continued investments\nin Citi\u2019s transformation.\n\nProvisions of $174 million\ndecreased 87%, primarily\ndriven by a net ACL release\ncompared to a net ACL build in\nthe prior year, partially\noffset by higher net credit\nlosses resulting from\npandemic-related charge-offs.\n\nThe net ACL release was $826\nmillion, compared to a build\nof $329 million in the prior\nyear. The release reflected an\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook and\nlower loan volumes.

In 2021, Citi\nentered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses\nin Australia and the Philippines, and made a decision to wind\ndown and close its Korea consumer banking business (for\nadditional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition, in January 2022, Citi entered into agreements to\nsell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia,\nTaiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

In addition, the businesses had\n$13.1 billion in outstanding card loan balances. These amounts\nexclude approximately $10 billion of loans ($7 billion of retail\nbanking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and\n$8 billion of deposits reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s agreements to sell its consumer banking\nbusinesses in Australia and the Philippines.

The\nnet loss included the\nfollowing items related to the\n13 exit markets: (i)\napproximately $1.1 billion\n(approximately $0.8 billion\nafter-tax) related to charges\nincurred from the voluntary\nearly retirement program\n(VERP) in connection with the\nwind-down of the Korea\nconsumer banking business;\n(ii) an approximate $0.7\nbillion pretax loss ($0.6\nbillion after-tax) related to\nthe agreement to sell the\nAustralia consumer banking\nbusiness, largely reflecting\nthe impact of a CTA loss (net\nof hedges); and (iii) contract\nmodification costs related to\nthe Asia divestitures of $119\nmillion ($98 million after-\ntax).\n\nExcluding the above items, net\nincome was $807 million\ncompared to net income of $475\nmillion in the prior year,\nreflecting significantly lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nlower revenues.\n\nRevenues decreased 16%,\nincluding the Australia loss\non sale. Excluding the\nAustralia loss on sale,\nrevenues declined 6%,\nreflecting lower retail\nbanking and cards revenues,\nlargely due to the continued\nimpact of the pandemic,\nincluding lower interest\nrates.\n\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 22%, including the\nAustralia loss on sale.\nExcluding the Australia loss\non sale, revenues decreased\n7%, as growth in both\ninvestment revenues and\ndeposits was more than offset\nby lower deposit spreads due\nto lower interest rates and\nlower FX and insurance\nrevenues. Assets under\nmanagement increased 3%,\nreflecting the impact of\nimproved market conditions, as\nwell as client engagement.\nAverage deposits increased 6%\nand average loans decreased\n2%. The decline in retail\nbanking revenues was also\nimpacted by a 3% decrease in\nretail lending revenues,\nreflecting a decline in\npersonal loans driven by\nspread compression.\n\nCards revenues decreased 5%,\nas lower average loans (down\n14%, including the\nreclassification to held-for-\nsale related to Australia and\nthe Philippines and higher\npayment rates) were partially\noffset by higher spending-\nrelated revenues (credit card\nspend volume up 8%),\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven low\nlevels in the prior year.\n\nExpenses increased 30%,\nincluding approximately $1.2\nbillion of costs related to\nthe Asia divestitures.\nExcluding the costs related to\nthe Asia divestitures,\nexpenses increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nbusiness-led investments,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions decreased 74%,\nprimarily driven by a net ACL\nrelease compared to a net ACL\nbuild in the prior year, as\nwell as lower net credit\nlosses. Net credit losses\ndecreased 10%, primarily\nreflecting lower cards loan\nvolumes and improved\ndelinquencies.\n\nThe net ACL release was $376\nmillion, compared to a build\nof $528 million in the prior\nyear.

The Standardized\nApproach generally applies\nprescribed supervisory risk\nweights to broad categories of\ncredit risk exposures. As a\nresult, credit risk-weighted\nassets calculated under the\nAdvanced Approaches are more\nrisk sensitive than those\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach. Market\nrisk-weighted assets are\ncurrently calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis\nunder both approaches. The\nStandardized Approach excludes\noperational risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, both Citi and Citibank,\nN.A. (Citibank) are required\nto maintain stated minimum\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital and Total\nCapital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0%\nand 8.0%, respectively.\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III\nrules implement the \u201ccapital\nfloor provision\u201d of the so-\ncalled \u201cCollins Amendment\u201d of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, which\nrequires Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations to\ncalculate each of the three\nrisk-based capital ratios\n(Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital and Total\nCapital) under both the U.S.\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach and the Advanced\nApproaches and comply with the\nmore binding of each of the\nresulting risk-based capital\nratios.\n                                                                \n  Tier 1 Leverage Ratio                                         \n                                                                \nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citi is also required\nto maintain a minimum Tier 1\nLeverage ratio of 4.0%. The\nTier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-\nrisk-based measure of capital\nadequacy, is defined as Tier 1\nCapital as a percentage of\nquarterly adjusted average\ntotal assets less amounts\ndeducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n                               29                               \n                                                                \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                                  \n                                                                \nCiti is also required to\ncalculate a Supplementary\nLeverage ratio, which differs\nfrom the Tier 1 Leverage ratio\nby also including certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures within\nthe denominator of the ratio\n(Total Leverage Exposure). The\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrepresents end-of-period Tier\n1 Capital to Total Leverage\nExposure, with the latter\ndefined as the sum of the\ndaily average of on-balance\nsheet assets for the quarter\nand the average of certain\noff-balance sheet exposures\ncalculated as of the last day\nof each month in the quarter,\nless applicable Tier 1 Capital\ndeductions. Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations are required to\nmaintain a stated minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including\nCiti, are subject to enhanced\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nstandards. These enhanced\nstandards establish a 2.0%\nleverage buffer in addition to\nthe stated 3.0% minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrequirement, for a total\neffective minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrequirement of 5.0%. If a U.S.\nGSIB fails to exceed this\nrequirement, it will be\nsubject to increasingly\nonerous restrictions\n(depending upon the extent of\nthe shortfall) regarding\ncapital distributions and\ndiscretionary executive bonus\npayments.\n                                                                \n  Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief                 \n                                                                \nIn April 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board issued an\ninterim final rule that\ntemporarily changed the\ncalculation of the\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nfor bank holding companies,\nincluding Citigroup, by\nexcluding U.S. Treasuries and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from Total Leverage\nExposure.\n\nThe interim final rule was\neffective for Citigroup\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio,\nas well as for Citigroup\u2019s\nleverage-based total loss\nabsorbing capacity (TLAC) and\nlong-term debt (LTD)\nrequirements, and expired as\nscheduled on March 31, 2021.\nCitigroup\u2019s reported\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 7.0% during the fourth\nquarter of 2020 benefited 109\nbasis points, as a result of\nthe temporary relief.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nIn September 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued a\nfinal rule (substantially\nunchanged from a March 2020\ninterim final rule) that\nmodified the regulatory\ncapital transition provision\nrelated to the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology. The September\n2020 final rule does not have\nany impact on U.S. GAAP\naccounting.\n\nThe final rule permitted banks\nto delay for two years the\n\u201cDay One\u201d adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology on January 1, 2020\nuntil January 1, 2022,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition to phase out the\nregulatory capital benefit\nprovided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing\nimpact of CECL, the agencies\nutilized a 25% scaling factor\nas an approximation of the\nincreased reserve build under\nCECL compared to the previous\nincurred loss model and,\ntherefore, allowed banks to\nadd back to Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital an amount equal to\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the\ncumulative 25% change in CECL-\nbased allowances\n\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will be\nphased in to regulatory\ncapital (i) at 25% per year on\nJanuary 1 of each year over\nthe three-year transition\nperiod, and (ii) along with\nthe delayed \u201cDay One\u201d impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision provided by the rule\nbeginning with the quarter\nended March 31, 2020.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of the\nCECL methodology, as well as\nthe ongoing adjustments for\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021,\nstarted to be phased in on\nJanuary 1, 2022 and will be\nfully reflected in Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital as of\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021,\nCitigroup\u2019s reported Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio of\n12.2% benefited from the\ndeferrals of the CECL\ntransition provision by 24\nbasis points (bps), which\nresulted in an approximate 6\nbps decrease to Citigroup\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio upon commencement of the\nphase-in on January 1, 2022.\nIn addition, this phase-in is\nexpected to result in an\nadditional 6 bps decrease to\nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio on January 1\nof each year through January\n1, 2025. For additional\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nCitibank\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios excluding the impact of\nthe CECL transition provision,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources (Full\nAdoption of CECL)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  TLAC Holdings                                                 \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, in\nJanuary 2021, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued a final rule\nthat created a new regulatory\ncapital deduction applicable\nto Advanced Approaches banking\norganizations for certain\ninvestments in covered debt\ninstruments issued by GSIBs.\nThe final rule became\neffective for Citigroup and\nCitibank on April 1, 2021, and\ndid not have a significant\nimpact on either Citigroup\u2019s\nor Citibank\u2019s regulatory\ncapital.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Buffers                                    \n                                                                \nCiti and Citibank are required\nto maintain several regulatory\ncapital buffers above stated\nminimum capital requirements.\nThese capital buffers would be\navailable to absorb losses in\nadvance of any potential\nimpairment of regulatory\ncapital below the stated\nminimum regulatory capital\nratio requirements.\n\nBanking organizations that\nfall below their regulatory\ncapital buffers are subject to\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers based on\na percentage of \u201cEligible\nRetained Income\u201d (ERI), with\nincreasing restrictions based\nupon the severity of the\nbreach. ERI is equal to the\ngreater of (i) the bank\u2019s net\nincome for the four calendar\nquarters preceding the current\ncalendar quarter, net of any\ndistributions and tax effects\nnot already reflected in net\nincome, and (ii) the average\nof the bank\u2019s net income for\nthe four calendar quarters\npreceding the current calendar\nquarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021,\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios exceeded effective\nregulatory minimum\nrequirements. Accordingly,\nCiti is not subject to payout\nlimitations as a result of\nBasel III requirements.\n                               30                               \nStress Capital Buffer\nCitigroup is subject to the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s Stress\nCapital Buffer (SCB) rule,\nwhich integrates the annual\nstress testing requirements\nwith ongoing regulatory\ncapital requirements. The SCB\nequals the peak-to-trough\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio decline under the\nSupervisory Severely Adverse\nscenario used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. SCB-based minimum\ncapital requirements will be\nreviewed and updated annually\nby the Federal Reserve Board\nas part of the CCAR process.\nFor additional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cStress Testing Component of\nCapital Planning\u201d below. The\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer (for\nadditional information, see\nbelow) will continue to apply\nunder the Advanced Approaches.\nIn August 2021, the Federal\nReserve Board finalized and\nannounced Citi\u2019s SCB\nrequirement of 3.0%.\nAccordingly, effective October\n1, 2021, Citigroup is required\nto maintain a 10.5% effective\nminimum Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach.\nPreviously, from October 1,\n2020 through September 30,\n2021, Citi had been subject to\na 2.5% SCB, and a 10.0%\neffective minimum Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\nunder the Standardized\nApproach. Capital Conservation\nBuffer and Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer Citigroup is\nsubject to a fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder the Advanced Approaches.\nCitibank is subject to the\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer under both\nthe Advanced Approaches and\nthe Standardized Approach. In\naddition, Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, such as\nCitigroup and Citibank, are\nsubject to a discretionary\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. The Federal Reserve\nBoard last voted to affirm the\nCountercyclical Capital Buffer\namount at the current level of\n0% in December 2020. GSIB\nSurcharge The Federal Reserve\nBoard imposes a risk-based\ncapital surcharge upon U.S.\nbank holding companies that\nare identified as global\nsystemically important bank\nholding companies (GSIBs),\nincluding Citi. The GSIB\nsurcharge augments the SCB,\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand, if invoked, any\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. A U.S. bank holding\ncompany that is designated a\nGSIB is required, on an annual\nbasis, to calculate a\nsurcharge using two methods\nand is subject to the higher\nof the resulting two\nsurcharges. The first method\n(\u201cmethod 1\u201d) is based on the\nBasel Committee\u2019s GSIB\nmethodology. Under the second\nmethod (\u201cmethod 2\u201d), the\nsubstitutability category\nunder the Basel Committee\u2019s\nGSIB methodology is replaced\nwith a quantitative measure\nintended to assess a GSIB\u2019s\nreliance on short-term\nwholesale funding. In\naddition, method 1\nincorporates relative measures\nof systemic importance across\ncertain global banking\norganizations and a year-end\nspot foreign exchange rate,\nwhereas method 2 uses fixed\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance and application of\nan average foreign exchange\nrate over a three-year period.\nThe GSIB surcharges\n\ncalculated under both method 1\nand method 2 are based on\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance from the year\nimmediately preceding that in\nwhich the GSIB surcharge\ncalculations are being\nperformed (e.g., the method 1\nand method 2 GSIB surcharges\ncalculated during 2021 will be\nbased on 2020 systemic\nindicator data). Generally,\nCiti\u2019s surcharge determined\nunder method 2 will result in\na higher surcharge than its\nsurcharge determined under\nmethod 1. Should a GSIB\u2019s\nsystemic importance increase\nfor more than one year, such\nthat it becomes subject to a\nhigher GSIB surcharge, the\nhigher surcharge would not\nbecome effective for a full\nyear after the second\nconsecutive higher score\n(e.g., a higher surcharge\ncalculated using data as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and December\n30, 2021 would not become\neffective until January 1,\n2023). However, if after two\nconsecutive years of a higher\nscore, a GSIB\u2019s systemic\nimportance changes such that\nthe GSIB would be subject to a\nlower surcharge, the GSIB\nwould be subject to the lower\nsurcharge in the calendar year\ncommencing one year later\n(e.g., a lower surcharge\ncalculated using data as of\nDecember 31, 2022 would become\neffective January 1, 2024).\nThe following table sets forth\nCiti\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 1 and method 2 during\n2021 and 2020:\n                                  \n              2021       2020     \n  Method 1     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  Method 2     3.0        3.0     \n                                  \nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective during both 2021 and\n2020 was 3.0%, as derived\nunder the higher method 2\nresult. Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective for 2022 will remain\nunchanged at 3.0%, as derived\nunder the higher method 2\nresult. Citi expects that its\nmethod 2 GSIB surcharge will\ncontinue to remain higher than\nits method 1 GSIB surcharge.\nAccordingly, based on Citi\u2019s\nmethod 2 result as of December\n31, 2020, and its estimated\nmethod 2 result as of December\n31, 2021, Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge is expected to\nincrease to 3.5% effective\nJanuary 1, 2023. Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge effective for 2024\nwill likely be based on the\nlower of its method 2 scores\nfor year-end 2021 and 2022,\nand therefore is not expected\nto exceed 3.5%. Prompt\nCorrective Action Framework In\ngeneral, the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) regulations\ndirect the U.S. banking\nagencies to enforce\nincreasingly strict\nlimitations on the activities\nof insured depository\ninstitutions that fail to meet\ncertain regulatory capital\nthresholds. The PCA framework\ncontains five categories of\ncapital adequacy as measured\nby risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios: (i) \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d (ii) \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d (iii)\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d (iv)\n\u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d and (v)\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\nAccordingly, an insured\ndepository institution, such\nas Citibank, must maintain\nminimum Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital, Tier 1 Capital, Total\nCapital and Tier 1 Leverage\nratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0%\nand 5.0%, respectively, to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\nIn addition, insured\ndepository\n                               31                               \ninstitution subsidiaries of\nU.S. GSIBs, including\nCitibank, must maintain a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage\nratio of 6.0% to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized.\u201d Citibank\nwas \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nFurthermore, to be \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under current\nfederal bank regulatory agency\ndefinitions, a bank holding\ncompany must have a Tier 1\nCapital ratio of at least\n6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of\nat least 10.0% and not be\nsubject to a Federal Reserve\nBoard directive to maintain\nhigher capital levels.\n                                                                \n  Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning                  \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to an annual\nassessment by the Federal\nReserve Board as to whether\nCitigroup has effective\ncapital planning processes as\nwell as sufficient regulatory\ncapital to absorb losses\nduring stressful economic and\nfinancial conditions, while\nalso meeting obligations to\ncreditors and counterparties\nand continuing to serve as a\ncredit intermediary. This\nannual assessment includes two\nrelated programs: the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most\ncomplex firms, such as Citi,\nCCAR includes a qualitative\nevaluation of a firm\u2019s\nabilities to determine its\ncapital needs on a forward-\nlooking basis. In conducting\nthe qualitative assessment,\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nevaluates firms\u2019 capital\nplanning practices, focusing\non six areas of capital\nplanning\u2014namely, governance,\nrisk management, internal\ncontrols, capital policies,\nincorporating stressful\nconditions and events, and\nestimating impact on capital\npositions. As part of the CCAR\nprocess, the Federal Reserve\nBoard evaluates Citi\u2019s capital\nadequacy, capital adequacy\nprocess and its planned\ncapital distributions, such as\ndividend payments and common\nshare repurchases. The Federal\nReserve Board assesses whether\nCiti has sufficient capital to\ncontinue operations throughout\ntimes of economic and\nfinancial market stress and\nwhether Citi has robust,\nforward-looking capital\nplanning processes that\naccount for its unique risks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, are subject to a\nrigorous evaluation of their\ncapital planning process.\nFirms with weak practices may\nbe subject to a deficient\nsupervisory rating, and\npotentially an enforcement\naction, for failing to meet\nsupervisory expectations. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions on Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nFederal Reserve Board and the\ngeneral public as to how\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios might change using a\nhypothetical set of adverse\neconomic conditions as\ndesigned by the Federal\nReserve Board. In addition to\nthe annual supervisory stress\ntest conducted by the Federal\nReserve Board, Citi is\nrequired to conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests under\nthe same adverse economic\nconditions designed by the\nFederal Reserve Board.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an\nestimate of projected\nrevenues, losses, reserves,\npro forma regulatory capital\nratios, and any other\nadditional capital measures\ndeemed relevant by Citi.\nProjections are required over\na nine-quarter planning\nhorizon under two supervisory\nscenarios (baseline and\n\nseverely adverse conditions).\nAll risk-based capital ratios\nreflect application of the\nStandardized Approach\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is\nrequired to conduct the annual\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Test.\nThe annual stress test\nconsists of a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions under several\nscenarios on Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nOffice of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency as to how\nCitibank\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios might change during a\nhypothetical set of adverse\neconomic conditions and to\nultimately evaluate the\nreliability of Citibank\u2019s\ncapital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are\nrequired to disclose the\nresults of their company-run\nstress tests.\n\nTemporary Federal Reserve\nBoard Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\n\nFrom the third quarter of 2020\nto the second quarter of 2021,\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nplaced temporary limitations\non capital distributions for\nCiti and other large banking\norganizations, to ensure that\nlarge banks maintained a high\nlevel of capital resilience\nthroughout the COVID-19\npandemic. Commencing July 1,\n2021, Citi\u2019s common\n\nstock dividends and share\nrepurchases were no longer\nsubject to limitations based\non the average of Citi\u2019s net\nincome for the\n\nfour preceding calendar\nquarters.\n\nAll large banks, including\nCiti, remain subject to\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions in the event of\na breach of\n\nany regulatory capital\nbuffers, including the Stress\nCapital\n\nBuffer, with the degree of\nsuch restrictions based on the\nextent\n\nto which the buffers are\nbreached.

Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences,\nand the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were\ndeferred and have commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at\n25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup was allowed to adjust retained earnings and\nthe ACL in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL\n(pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and\nthe ACL between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 commenced\nphase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January\n1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January\n1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average\non-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted\naverage total assets and Total Leverage Exposure. Additionally,\nthe increase in DTAs arising from temporary differences upon the\nJanuary 1, 2020 adoption date were deducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and commenced phase-in to RWA at 25% per year\nbeginning January 1, 2022.\n\n(2) Citi\u2019s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1\nCapital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, and\nunder the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of December\n31, 2020, whereas Citi\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was the\nlower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework\nfor all periods presented.\n\n(3) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator.

to\nnoncumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are excluded from common\nstockholders\u2019 equity and netted against such preferred stock in\naccordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting\nrequirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date were deferred\nand commenced phase-in to regulatory capital at 25% per year\nbeginning January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL,\nCitigroup was allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in\nan amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL (pretax) for\neach period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the ACL between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 have also commenced phase\nin to regulatory capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,\n2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the January 1,\n2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n\n(4) Of Citi's $24.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2021,\n$15.3 billion was included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\npursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.5 billion was\nexcluded. Excluded from Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as\nof December 31, 2021 was $11.3 billion of net DTAs arising from\nnet operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by\n$1.8 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets that are separately deducted\nfrom capital . DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required\nto be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are required to be deducted from capital only if\nthese DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitation under the U.S. Basel III\nrules. Citi\u2019s DTAs do not currently exceed this limitation and,\ntherefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing\nJanuary 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market-making\npositions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in\naccordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S.\nagencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital\ndeduction, permitted market-making positions in third-party\ncovered funds are included in risk-weighted assets.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities that were previously eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing January 1,\n2022, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities have been\nfully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework was $4.4 billion and $5.2\nbillion at December 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n                               35                               \n

The quarter-over-\nquarter decrease was primarily\ndriven by an increase in Total\nLeverage Exposure, primarily\ndriven by an increase in\naverage on-balance sheet\nassets, as well as adverse net\nmov ements in AOCI , partially\noffset by net income in the\nquarter. The year-over-year\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby an increase in Total\nLeverage Exposure, largely due\nto an approximate 100 basis\npoint impact from the\nexpiration of the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s temporary\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrelief.

SA-CCR replaced the\nCurrent Exposure Method (CEM),\nwhich was the previous\nmethodology used to calculate\nexposure for all derivative\ncontracts under the\nStandardized Approach, as well\nas RWA for derivative\ncontracts under the Advanced\nApproaches in cases where\ninternal models are not used.\nIn addition, SA-CCR replaced\nCEM in numerous other\ninstances throughout the\nregulatory framework,\nincluding but not limited to\nthe Supplementary Leverage\nRatio, certain components of\nthe GSIB score, single\ncounterparty credit limits and\nlegal lending limits.\n\nUnder SA-CCR, a banking\norganization calculates the\nexposure amount of its\nderivative contracts at the\nnetting set level. Multiple\nderivative contracts are\ngenerally considered to be\nunder the same netting set as\nlong as each derivative\ncontract is subject to the\nsame qualifying master netting\nagreement. SA-CCR also\nintroduced the concept of\nhedging sets, which allows a\nbanking organization to fully\nor partially net derivative\ncontracts within the same\nnetting set that share similar\nrisk factors. Moreover, SA-CCR\nincorporated updated\nsupervisory and maturity\nfactors to calculate the\npotential future exposure of a\nderivative contract, and\nprovides for improved\nrecognition of collateral.\nUnder the final rule, the\nexposure amount of a netting\nset is equal to an alpha\nfactor of 1.4 multiplied by\nthe sum of the replacement\ncost and potential future\nexposure of the netting set.\n\nCiti adopted SA-CCR as of the\nmandatory compliance date of\nJanuary 1, 2022. Adoption of\nSA-CCR increased Citigroup\u2019s\nStandardized RWA by\napproximately $51 billion,\nwhich resulted in a 49 bps\ndecrease to Citigroup\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\nunder the Standardized\nApproaches on January 1, 2022.\nCitigroup\u2019s reported CET1\nCapital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was 12.25%,\n75 bps above its 11.5% CET1\nCapital target, and 175 bps\nabove its 10.5% effective\nregulatory minimum CET1\nCapital requirement under the\nStandardized Approach.\n\nAdoption of SA-CCR also\nincreased Citigroup\u2019s Advanced\nRWA by approximately $29\nbillion, which resulted in a\n29 bps decrease to Citigroup\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio under the Advanced\nApproaches on January 1, 2022.\nCitigroup\u2019s reported CET1\nCapital ratio under the\nAdvanced Approaches as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was 12.35%,\n85 bps above its 11.5% CET1\nCapital target, and 235 bps\nabove its 10.0% effective\nregulatory minimum CET1\nCapital requirement under the\nAdvanced Approaches.\n\nCitigroup voluntarily\nsuspended share repurchases\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2021, in anticipation of the\nadverse impact resulting from\nSA-CCR adoption. Citi resumed\ncommon share repurchases in\nJanuary 2022.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Standards Developments                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Basel III Revisions                                           \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, the\nBasel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee)\nhas finalized certain Basel\nIII post-crisis regulatory\nreforms. The reforms relate to\nthe methodologies in deriving\ncredit, market and operational\nrisk-weighted assets, the\nimposition of a new aggregate\noutput floor for risk-weighted\nassets, and revisions to the\nleverage ratio framework.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies may\nrevise the U.S. Basel III\nrules in the future, in\nresponse to the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s Basel III post-\ncrisis regulatory reforms.

For\nadditional information about\nrisks and uncertainties that\ncould impact Citi, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nrespective business\u2019 results\nof operations above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u201d below.\nThe following risk factors are\ncategorized to improve the\nreadability and usefulness of\nthe risk factor disclosure,\nand, while the headings and\nrisk factors generally align\nwith Citi\u2019s risk\ncategorization, in certain\ninstances the risk factors may\nnot directly correspond with\nhow Citi categorizes or\nmanages its risks.\n                                                                \n  MARKET-RELATED RISKS                                          \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic, Geopolitical\nand Other Challenges and\nUncertainties Globally Could\nHave a Negative Impact on\nCiti\u2019s Businesses and Results\nof Operations.\n\nIn addition to the significant\nmacroeconomic challenges posed\nby the pandemic (see the\npandemic-related risk factor\nbelow), Citi has experienced,\nand could experience in the\nfuture, negative impacts to\nits businesses and results of\noperations as a result of\nother macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges, uncertainties and\nvolatility.\n\nFor example, the recent action\nof Russian military forces and\nsupport personnel in Ukraine\nhas escalated tensions between\nRussia and the U.S., NATO, the\nEU and the U.K. The U.S. has\nimposed, and is likely to\nimpose material additional,\nfinancial and economic\nsanctions and export controls\nagainst certain Russian\norganizations and/or\nindividuals, with similar\nactions either implemented or\nplanned by the EU and the U.K.\nand other jurisdictions.\nDuring the week of February\n21, 2022, the U.S., the U.K.,\nand the EU each imposed\npackages of financial and\neconomic sanctions that, in\nvarious ways, constrain\ntransactions with numerous\nRussian entities and\nindividuals; transactions in\nRussian sovereign debt; and\ninvestment, trade, and\nfinancing to, from, or in\ncertain regions of Ukraine.\nCiti\u2019s ability to engage in\nactivity with certain consumer\nand institutional businesses\nin Russia and Ukraine or\ninvolving certain Russian or\nUkrainian businesses and\ncustomers is dependent in part\nupon whether such engagement\nis restricted under any\ncurrent or expected U.S., EU\nand other countries or U.K.\nsanctions and laws. Sanctions\nand export controls, as well\nas any actions by Russia,\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\nbusiness activities and\ncustomers in and from Russia\nand Ukraine. Moreover, actions\nby Russia, and any further\nmeasures taken by the U.S. or\nits allies, could have\nnegative impacts on regional\nand global financial markets\nand economic conditions. For\nadditional information about\nthese and other related risks,\nsee the operational processes\nand systems, cybersecurity and\nemerging markets risk factors\nbelow. For additional\ninformation about Citi\u2019s\nexposures in\n\nRussia, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n\nAdditionally, governmental\nfiscal and monetary actions,\nor expected actions, such as\nchanges in interest rate\npolicies and any program\nimplemented by a central bank\nto change the size of its\nbalance sheet, could\nsignificantly impact interest\nrates, economic growth rates,\nthe volatility of global\nfinancial markets, foreign\nexchange rates and global\ncapital flows. Further, it\nremains uncertain to what\nextent central banks may keep\ninterest rates low or whether\ncentral banks might raise\ninterest rates or reduce the\nsize of their balance sheets,\nparticularly as inflationary\npressures continue and the\nU.S. and global economies\ncontinue to improve. While\nearlier in the pandemic the\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB)\nand other central banks took\nactions to support the global\neconomy, including by further\nreducing their benchmark\ninterest rates, mismatches\nbetween supply and demand of\ngoods and services contributed\nto a rise in inflation in\n2021, prompting the FRB to\nannounce the approaching end\nof the period of\nextraordinarily low interest\nrates.\n\nInterest rates on loans Citi\nmakes are typically based off\nor set at a spread over a\nbenchmark interest rate, and\nwould likely decline or rise\nas benchmark rates decline or\nrise, respectively. While the\ninterest rates at which Citi\npays depositors are already\nlow and unlikely to decline\nmuch further, declining or\ncontinued low interest rates\nfor loans could further\ncompress Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome. Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome could also be adversely\naffected due to a flattening\nof the interest rate yield\ncurve (e.g., a lower spread\nbetween shorter-term versus\nlonger-term interest rates),\nas Citi, similar to other\nbanks, typically pays interest\non deposits based on shorter-\nterm interest rates and earns\nmoney on loans based on\nlonger-term interest rates.\n\nIn contrast, an abrupt and\nsustained increase in interest\nrates could interfere with the\nglobal macroeconomic recovery,\nwhether due to continued or\nincreased inflationary\npressures or otherwise. And\nwhile Citi estimates its\noverall net interest income\nwould generally increase due\nto higher interest rates,\nhigher rates could adversely\naffect Citi\u2019s funding costs,\nlevels of deposits in its\nconsumer and institutional\nbusinesses and certain\nbusiness or product revenues.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s interest rate risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Market\nRisk\u2014Net Interest Income at\nRisk\u201d below.\n\nAdditional areas of\nuncertainty include, among\nothers, an elevated level of\ninflation resulting in adverse\nspill-over effects; the\nability of Congress to raise\nthe federal debt ceiling;\nslowing of the Chinese\neconomy, including negative\neconomic impacts associated\nwith such slowdown or any\npolicy actions; significant\ndisruptions and volatility in\nfinancial markets; other\ngeopolitical tensions and\nconflicts; protracted or\nwidespread trade tensions;\nfinancial market, other\neconomic and political\ndisruption driven by anti-\nestablishment movements;\nnatural disasters; other\npandemics; and election\noutcomes. For example, Citi\u2019s\nmarket-making businesses can\nsuffer losses resulting from\nthe widening of credit spreads\ndue to unanticipated changes\nin financial markets. In\naddition, adverse developments\nor downturns in one or more of\nthe world\u2019s larger economies\nwould likely have a\nsignificant impact on the\nglobal economy or the\neconomies of other countries\nbecause of global financial\nand economic linkages.\n                               45                               \nThese and additional global\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other challenges,\nuncertainties and volatilities\nhave negatively impacted, and\ncould continue to negatively\nimpact, Citi\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, including\nits credit costs, revenues\nacross ICG and GCB and AOCI\n(which would in turn\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s book\nand tangible book value).\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nRapidly Evolving Challenges\nand Uncertainties Related to\nthe COVID-19 Pandemic in the\nU.S. and Globally Will Likely\nContinue to Have Negative\nImpacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses\nand Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has\naffected all of the countries\nand jurisdictions in which\nCiti operates, including\nseverely impacting global\nhealth, financial markets,\nconsumer and business spending\nand economic conditions. The\nextent of the future pandemic\nimpacts remain uncertain and\nwill likely evolve by region,\ncountry or state, largely\ndepending on the duration and\nseverity of the public health\nconsequences, including the\nduration and further spread of\nthe coronavirus as well as any\nvariants becoming more\nprevalent and impactful;\nfurther production,\ndistribution, acceptance and\neffectiveness of vaccines;\navailability and efficiency of\ntesting; the public response;\nand government actions. The\nfuture impacts to global\neconomic conditions may\ninclude, among others:\n\n\u2022 further disruption of global\nsupply chains;\n\n\u2022 higher inflation;\n\n\u2022 higher interest rates;\n\n\u2022 significant disruption and\nvolatility in financial\nmarkets;\n\n\u2022 additional closures, reduced\nactivity and failures of many\nbusinesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and net losses;\n\n\u2022 further institution of\nsocial distancing and\nrestrictions on businesses and\nthe movement of the public in\nand among the U.S. and other\ncountries; and\n\n\u2022 reduced U.S. and global\neconomic output.\n\nThe pandemic has had, and may\ncontinue to have, negative\nimpacts on Citi\u2019s businesses\nand overall results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, which could be\nmaterial. The extent of the\nimpact on Citi\u2019s operations\nand financial performance,\nincluding its ability to\nexecute its business\nstrategies and initiatives,\nwill continue to depend\nsignificantly on future\ndevelopments in the U.S. and\nglobally. Such developments\nare uncertain and cannot be\npredicted, including the\ncourse of the coronavirus, as\nwell as any weakness or\nslowing in the economic\nrecovery or a further economic\ndownturn, whether due to\nfurther supply chain\ndisruptions, inflation trends,\nhigher interest rates or\notherwise.\n\nThe pandemic may not be\nsufficiently contained for an\nextended period of time. A\nprolonged health crisis could\nreduce economic activity in\nthe U.S. and other countries,\nresulting in additional\ndeclines or weakness in\nemployment trends and business\nand consumer confidence. These\nfactors could negatively\nimpact global economic\nactivity and markets; cause a\ncontinued decline in the\ndemand for Citi\u2019s products and\nservices and in its revenues;\nfurther increase Citi\u2019s credit\nand other costs; and may\nresult in impairment of long-\nlived\n\nassets or goodwill. These\nfactors could also cause an\nincrease in Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet, risk-weighted assets\nand ACL, resulting in a\ndecline in regulatory capital\nratios or liquidity measures,\nas well as regulatory demands\nfor higher capital levels\nand/or limitations or\nreductions in capital\ndistributions (such as common\nshare repurchases and\ndividends). Moreover, any\ndisruption or failure of\nCiti\u2019s performance of, or its\nability to perform, key\nbusiness functions, as a\nresult of the continued spread\nof COVID-19 or otherwise,\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\noperations.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\nborrowers will vary by sector\nor industry, with some\nborrowers experiencing greater\nstress levels, particularly as\ncredit and customer assistance\nsupport further winds down,\nwhich could lead to increased\npressure on their results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, increased\nborrowings or credit ratings\ndowngrades, thus likely\nleading to higher credit costs\nfor Citi. These borrowers\ninclude, among others,\nbusinesses that are more\ndirectly impacted by the\ninstitution of social\ndistancing, the movement of\nthe public and store closures.\nIn addition, stress levels\nultimately experienced by\nCiti\u2019s borrowers may be\ndifferent from and more\nintense than assumptions made\nin prior estimates or models\nused by Citi, resulting in an\nincrease in Citi\u2019s ACL or net\ncredit losses, particularly as\nthe benefits of fiscal\nstimulus and government\nsupport programs diminish.\n\nOngoing legislative and\nregulatory changes in the U.S.\nand globally to address the\neconomic impact from the\npandemic could further affect\nCiti\u2019s businesses, operations\nand financial performance.\nCiti could also face\nchallenges, including legal\nand reputational, and scrutiny\nin its efforts to provide\nrelief measures. Such efforts\nhave resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in,\nlitigation, including class\nactions, and regulatory and\ngovernment actions and\nproceedings. Such actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties and\nfines adverse to Citi. In\naddition, the different types\nof government actions could\nvary in scale and duration\nacross jurisdictions and\nregions with varying degrees\nof effectiveness.\n\nCiti has taken measures to\nmaintain the health and safety\nof its colleagues; however,\nthese measures could result in\nadditional expenses, and\nillness of employees could\nnegatively affect staffing for\na period of time. In addition,\nCiti\u2019s ability to recruit,\nhire and onboard colleagues in\nkey areas could be negatively\nimpacted by pandemic\nrestrictions as well as Citi\u2019s\nCOVID-19 vaccination\nrequirement (see the qualified\ncolleagues risk factor below).\n\nFurther, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic or business\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted after the\npandemic. The post-pandemic\nenvironment may undergo\nunexpected developments or\nchanges in financial markets,\nfiscal, monetary, tax and\nregulatory environments and\nconsumer customer and\ncorporate client behavior.\nThese developments and changes\ncould have an adverse impact\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Ongoing business\nand regulatory uncertainties\nand changes may make Citi\u2019s\nlonger-term business, balance\nsheet and strategic and budget\nplanning more difficult or\ncostly. Citi and its\nmanagement and businesses may\nalso experience increased or\ndifferent competitive and\nother challenges in this\nenvironment.\n                               46                               \nTo the extent that it is not\nable to adapt or compete\neffectively, Citi could\nexperience loss of business\nand its results of operations\nand financial condition could\nsuffer (see the competitive\nchallenges risk factor below).\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Return\nCapital to Common Shareholders\nConsistent with Its Capital\nPlanning Efforts and Targets\nSubstantially Depends on\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements, Including the\nResults of the CCAR Process\nand Regulatory Stress Tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to its common\nshareholders consistent with\nits capital planning efforts\nand targets, whether through\nits common stock dividend or\nthrough a share repurchase\nprogram, substantially\ndepends, among other things,\non regulatory capital\nrequirements, including the\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB),\nwhich is based upon the\nresults of the CCAR process\nrequired by the FRB as well as\nthe supervisory stress tests\nrequired under the Dodd- Frank\nAct (as described in more\ndetail below).\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital also depends on its\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, the\ncapital impact related to\ndivestitures, forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions, its\nimplementation and maintenance\nof an effective capital\nplanning process and\nmanagement framework, and\neffectiveness in planning,\nmanaging and calculating its\nlevel of risk-weighted assets\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach,\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio\n(SLR) and global systemically\nimportant bank holding company\n(GSIB) surcharge, which has\nbeen made more challenging due\nto elevated levels of\nliquidity in the financial\nsystem related to the pandemic\n(see the macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nrisk factor above).\n\nChanges in regulatory capital\nrules, requirements or\ninterpretations could have a\nmaterial impact on Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital, both as a\nresult of changes in Citi\u2019s\nreported regulatory capital\nand integration into the CCAR\nprocess and regulatory stress\ntests. For example, Citi was\nrequired to adopt the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) as of January 1, 2022,\nwhich resulted in an\napproximate $51 billion\nincrease in Citi\u2019s risk-\nweighted assets under the\nStandardized Approach. Citi\nvoluntarily suspended common\nshare repurchases during the\nfourth quarter of 2021, in\nanticipation of the adverse\nimpact resulting from the\nadoption of SA-CCR. Citi will\nbe required to adopt SA-CCR\nfor purposes of the\nsupervisory stress test during\nthe 2023 cycle and SA-CCR may\nbe considered by management\nduring the 2022 cycle for\npurposes of management\u2019s own\ncapital adequacy assessment.\nIn addition, the U.S. banking\nagencies may potentially\nconsider a number of changes\nto the U.S. regulatory capital\nframework in the future,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nrevisions to the U.S. Basel\nIII rules, recalibration of\nthe GSIB surcharge and SLR,\nand enactment of the\ndiscretionary Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer. All of these\npotential changes could\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital position or\nincrease Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, will continue to be\nsubject to a rigorous\nregulatory evaluation of\ncapital planning practices,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ngovernance, risk management\nand internal controls. Citi\u2019s\nability to return\n\ncapital may be adversely\nimpacted if such an evaluation\nof Citi resulted in negative\nfindings. In addition, Citi\u2019s\nability to accurately predict,\ninterpret or explain to\nstakeholders the results of\nthe CCAR process, and thus to\naddress any market or investor\nperceptions, may be limited as\nthe FRB\u2019s assessment of Citi\u2019s\ncapital adequacy is conducted\nusing the FRB\u2019s proprietary\nstress test models. For\nadditional information on\nlimitations on Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital to common\nshareholders, as well as the\nCCAR process, supervisory\nstress test requirements and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Overview\u201d and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nTesting Component of Capital\nPlanning\u201d above and the risk\nmanagement risk factor below.\n\nThe FRB has stated that it\nexpects leading capital\nadequacy practices to continue\nto evolve and to likely be\ndetermined by the FRB each\nyear as a result of its cross-\nfirm review of capital plan\nsubmissions. Similarly, the\nFRB has indicated that, as\npart of its stated goal to\ncontinually evolve its annual\nstress testing requirements,\nseveral parameters of the\nannual stress testing process\nmay continue to be altered,\nincluding the severity of the\nstress test scenario, the FRB\nmodeling of Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet, pre-provision net\nrevenue (PPNR) and stress\nlosses, and the addition of\ncomponents deemed important by\nthe FRB.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022,\nCiti was required to phase\ninto regulatory capital at 25%\nper year the changes in\nretained earnings, deferred\ntax assets and ACL determined\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date, as well as\nsubsequent changes in the ACL\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The FRB has\nstated that it plans to\nmaintain its current framework\nfor calculating allowances on\nloans in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2023\nsupervisory stress test cycle,\nwhile continuing to evaluate\nappropriate future\nenhancements to this\nframework. The impacts on\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy of the\nFRB\u2019s incorporation of CECL in\nits supervisory stress tests\non an ongoing basis, and of\nother potential regulatory\nchanges in the FRB\u2019s stress\ntesting methodologies, remain\nunclear. For additional\ninformation regarding the CECL\nmethodology, including the\ntransition provisions related\nto the adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Current Regulatory\nCapital Standards\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses\nMethodology\u201d above and Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nIn addition, the FRB has\nintegrated the annual stress\ntesting requirements with\nongoing regulatory capital\nrequirements. For Citigroup,\nthe SCB equals the maximum\ndecline in Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\nunder the supervisory severely\nadverse scenario over a nine-\nquarter CCAR measurement\nperiod, plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a\nminimum requirement of 2.5%.\nEffective October 1, 2021,\nCiti\u2019s SCB was 3.0%. The SCB\nis calculated by the FRB using\nits proprietary data and\nmodeling of each firm\u2019s\nresults. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nSCB may change annually, or\npossibly more frequently,\nbased on the supervisory\nstress test results, thus\npotentially resulting in\nvolatility in the calculation\nof the SCB. Similar to the\nother regulatory capital\nbuffers, a breach of the SCB\nwould result in graduated\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions. For additional\n                               47                               \ninformation on the SCB,\nincluding its calculation, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Buffers\u201d above.\n\nAlthough various uncertainties\nexist regarding the extent of,\nand the ultimate impact to\nCiti from, these changes to\nthe FRB\u2019s regulatory capital,\nstress testing and CCAR\nregimes, these changes could\nincrease the level of capital\nCiti is required or elects to\nhold, including as part of\nCiti\u2019s management buffer, thus\npotentially impacting the\nextent to which Citi is able\nto return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nCiti, Its Management and Its\nBusinesses Must Continually\nReview, Analyze and\nSuccessfully Adapt to Ongoing\nRegulatory and Legislative\nUncertainties and Changes in\nthe U.S. and Globally.\n\nDespite the adoption of final\nregulations and laws in\nnumerous areas impacting Citi\nand its businesses over the\npast several years, Citi, its\nmanagement and its businesses\ncontinually face ongoing\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes,\nboth in the U.S. and globally.\nWhile the areas of ongoing\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes\nfacing Citi are too numerous\nto list completely, various\nexamples include, but are not\nlimited to (i) potential\nfiscal, monetary, regulatory,\ntax and other changes arising\nfrom the U.S. federal\ngovernment and other\ngovernments, including as a\nresult of the differing\npriorities of the current U.S.\npresidential administration,\nchanges in regulatory\nleadership or focus and\nactions of Congress or in\nresponse to the pandemic; (ii)\npotential changes to various\naspects of the regulatory\ncapital framework and\nrequirements applicable to\nCiti (see the capital return\nrisk factor and \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards Developments\u201d\nabove); and (iii) future\nlegislative and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. and\nglobally related to climate\nchange, including any new\ndisclosure requirements (see\nthe climate change risk factor\nbelow). When referring to\n\u201cregulatory,\u201d Citi is\nincluding both formal\nregulation and the views and\nexpectations of its regulators\nin their supervisory roles.\n\nU.S. and international\nregulatory and legislative\ninitiatives have not always\nbeen undertaken or implemented\non a coordinated basis, and\nareas of divergence have\ndeveloped and continue to\ndevelop with respect to the\nscope, interpretation, timing,\nstructure or approach, leading\nto inconsistent or even\nconflicting requirements,\nincluding within a single\njurisdiction. For example, in\nMay 2019, the European\nCommission adopted, as part of\nCapital Requirements Directive\nV (CRD V), a new requirement\nfor major banking groups\nheadquartered outside the EU\n(which would include Citi) to\nestablish an intermediate EU\nholding company where the\nforeign bank has two or more\ninstitutions (broadly meaning\nbanks, broker-dealers and\nsimilar financial firms)\nestablished in the EU. While\nin some respects the\nrequirement mirrors an\nexisting U.S. requirement for\nnon-U.S. banking organizations\nto form U.S. intermediate\nholding companies, the\nimplementation of the EU\nholding company requirement\ncould lead to additional\ncomplexity with respect to\nCiti\u2019s resolution planning,\ncapital and liquidity\nallocation and efficiency in\nvarious jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes make Citi\u2019s and\nits management\u2019s long-term\nbusiness, balance sheet and\nstrategic budget\n\nplanning difficult, subject to\nchange and potentially more\ncostly. U.S. and other\nregulators globally have\nimplemented and continue to\ndiscuss various changes to\ncertain regulatory\nrequirements, which would\nrequire ongoing assessment by\nmanagement as to the impact to\nCiti, its businesses and\nbusiness planning. For\nexample, while the Basel III\npost-crisis regulatory reforms\nand revised market risk\nframework have been finalized\nat the international level,\nthere remain significant\nuncertainties with respect to\nthe integration of these\nrevisions into the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework.\nBusiness planning is required\nto be based on possible or\nproposed rules or outcomes,\nwhich can change dramatically\nupon finalization, or upon\nimplementation or interpretive\nguidance from numerous\nregulatory bodies worldwide,\nand such guidance can change.\n\nRegulatory and legislative\nchanges have also\nsignificantly increased Citi\u2019s\ncompliance risks and costs\n(see the implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below) and\ncan adversely affect Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nCiti\u2019s Continued Investment\nand Other Initiatives as Part\nof Its Transformation and\nStrategic Refresh May Not Be\nas Successful as It Projects\nor Expects.\n\nAs part of its transformation\ninitiatives, Citi continues to\nmake significant investments\nto improve its infrastructure,\nrisk management and controls\nand further enhance safety and\nsoundness (for additional\ninformation, see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below). Citi also\ncontinues to execute on its\nstrategic refresh that\nincludes, among other things,\nits exit of certain consumer\nbanking businesses (see below)\nand its investments to deepen\nclient relationships and\nenhance client offerings and\ncapabilities in order to\nsimplify the Company and\nenhance its allocation of\nresources.\n\nFor example, Citi continues to\ninvest in its technology and\ndigital capabilities across\nthe franchise, including\ndigital platforms and mobile\nand cloud-based solutions. In\naddition, Citi has been making\nother investments across the\nCompany, such as in Citi\u2019s\nwealth management business,\ncommercial banking business,\ntreasury and trade solutions,\nsecurities services and other\nbusinesses, including\nimplementing new capabilities\nand partnerships. Citi has\nalso been pursuing\nproductivity improvements\nthrough various technology and\ndigital initiatives,\norganizational simplification\nand location strategies.\nFailure to properly invest in\nand upgrade Citi\u2019s technology\nand processes could result in\nan inability to be\nsufficiently competitive,\nserve clients effectively and\navoid operational errors (for\nadditional information, see\nthe operational processes and\nsystems risk factor below).\nThere is no guarantee that\nthese or other initiatives\nCiti may pursue will be as\nproductive or effective as\nCiti expects, or at all.\n\nFurthermore, Citi\u2019s strategic\nrefresh necessitates further\nchanges in and exits of\ncertain businesses, which\ninvolve significant execution\ncomplexity, and could result\nin additional losses, charges\nor other negative financial\nimpacts. For example, Citi may\nnot be able to achieve its\nobjectives related to its\nexits of 13 consumer markets\nin Asia and EMEA or exit of\nthe consumer, small business\nand middle-market banking\noperations in Mexico. These\nexits may not be as\nproductive, effective or\ntimely as Citi expects and may\nresult\n                               48                               \nin additional foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments (CTA)\nor other losses, charges or\nother negative financial or\nstrategic impacts, which could\nbe material. For additional\ninformation on CTA losses, see\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates risk factor below.\n\nCiti\u2019s investment and other\ninitiatives may continue to\nevolve as its business\nstrategies, the market\nenvironment and regulatory\nexpectations change, which\ncould make the initiatives\nmore costly and more\nchallenging to implement, and\nlimit their effectiveness.\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s ability to\nachieve expected returns on\nits investments and costs\nsavings depends, in part, on\nfactors that it cannot\ncontrol, including, among\nothers, interest rates;\ninflation; impacts related to\nthe pandemic; customer, client\nand competitor actions; and\nongoing regulatory changes.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Utilize Its\nDTAs, and Thus Reduce the\nNegative Impact of the DTAs on\nCiti\u2019s Regulatory Capital,\nWill Be Driven by Its Ability\nto Generate U.S. Taxable\nIncome.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Citi\u2019s\nnet DTAs were $24.8 billion,\nnet of a valuation allowance\nof $4.2 billion, of which $9.5\nbillion was deducted from\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules, primarily relating\nto net operating losses,\nforeign tax credit and general\nbusiness credit carry-forwards\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Components of\nCitigroup Capital\u201d above).\n\nOf the net DTAs at December\n31, 2021, $2.8 billion related\nto foreign tax credit (FTC)\ncarry-forwards, net of a\nvaluation allowance. The\ncarry-forward utilization\nperiod for FTCs is 10 years\nand represents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs. The FTC carry-forwards\nat December 31, 2021 expire\nover the period of 2022\u20132029.\nCiti must utilize any FTCs\ngenerated in the then-current-\nyear tax return prior to\nutilizing any carry-forward\nFTCs.\n\nThe accounting treatment for\nrealization of DTAs, including\nFTCs, is complex and requires\nsignificant judgment and\nestimates regarding future\ntaxable earnings in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise and available tax\nplanning strategies. Forecasts\nof future taxable earnings\nwill depend upon various\nfactors, including, among\nothers, the continued impact\nof the pandemic and other\nmacroeconomic conditions. In\naddition, any future increase\nin U.S. corporate tax rates\ncould result in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s DTA, which may subject\nmore of Citi\u2019s existing DTA to\nexclusion from regulatory\ncapital while improving Citi\u2019s\nability to utilize its FTC\ncarry-forwards.\n\nCiti\u2019s overall ability to\nrealize its DTAs will\nprimarily be dependent upon\nits ability to generate U.S.\ntaxable income in the relevant\ntax carry-forward periods.\nAlthough utilization of FTCs\nin any year is generally\nlimited to 21% of foreign\nsource taxable income in that\nyear, overall domestic losses\n(ODL) that Citi has incurred\nin the past allow it to\nreclassify domestic source\nincome as foreign source.\nFailure to realize any portion\nof the net DTAs would have a\ncorresponding negative impact\non Citi\u2019s net income and\nfinancial returns.\n\nCiti has not been and does not\nexpect to be subject to the\nBase Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax\n(BEAT), which, if applicable\nto Citi in any given year,\nwould have a significantly\nadverse effect on both Citi\u2019s\nnet income and regulatory\ncapital.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including FTCs,\nsee \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCiti\u2019s Interpretation or\nApplication of the Complex Tax\nLaws to Which It Is Subject\nCould Differ from Those of the\nRelevant Governmental\nAuthorities, Which Could\nResult in Litigation or\nExaminations and the Payment\nof Additional Taxes, Penalties\nor Interest.\n\nCiti is subject to various\nincome-based tax laws of the\nU.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the\nnumerous non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it\noperates. These tax laws are\ninherently complex and Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these laws,\nincluding the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act (Tax Reform), to its\nentities, operations and\nbusinesses. In addition, Citi\nis subject to litigation or\nexaminations with U.S. and\nnon-U.S. tax authorities\nregarding non-income-based tax\nmatters. Citi\u2019s\ninterpretations or application\nof the tax laws, including\nwith respect to Tax Reform,\nwithholding, stamp, service\nand other non-income taxes,\ncould differ from that of the\nrelevant governmental taxing\nauthority, which could result\nin the requirement to pay\nadditional taxes, penalties or\ninterest, which could be\nmaterial. For additional\ninformation on the litigation\nand examinations involving\nnon-U.S. tax authorities, see\nNote 27 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nA Deterioration in or Failure\nto Maintain Citi\u2019s Co-Branding\nor Private Label Credit Card\nRelationships, Including as a\nResult of Early Termination,\nBankruptcy or Liquidation,\nCould Have a Negative Impact\non Citi\u2019s Results of\nOperations or Financial\nCondition.\n\nCiti has co-branding and\nprivate label relationships\nthrough its branded cards and\nretail services credit card\nbusinesses with various\nretailers and merchants\nglobally, whereby in the\nordinary course of business\nCiti issues credit cards to\ncustomers of the retailers or\nmerchants. The five largest\nrelationships across both\nbusinesses in North America\nGCB constituted an aggregate\nof approximately 9% of Citi\u2019s\nrevenues in 2021 (for\nadditional information, see \u201c\nGlobal Consumer Banking \u2014\nNorth America GCB \u201d above).\nCiti\u2019s co-branding and private\nlabel agreements provide for\nshared economics between the\nparties and generally have a\nfixed term.\n\nOver the last several years, a\nnumber of U.S. retailers have\ncontinued to experience\ndeclining sales due to the\npandemic or otherwise, which\nhas resulted in significant\nnumbers of store closures and,\nin a number of cases,\nbankruptcies, as retailers\nattempt to cut costs and\nreorganize. In addition, as\nhas been widely reported,\ncompetition among card\nissuers, including Citi, for\nthese relationships is\nsignificant, and it has become\nincreasingly difficult in\nrecent years to maintain such\nrelationships on the same\nterms or at all.\n\nCiti\u2019s co-branding and private\nlabel relationships could be\nnegatively impacted by, among\nother things, the general\neconomic environment; changes\nin consumer sentiment,\nspending patterns and credit\ncard usage behaviors; a\ndecline in sales and revenues,\npartner store closures,\ngovernment\n                               49                               \nimposed restrictions, reduced\nair and business travel, or\nother operational difficulties\nof the retailer or merchant;\nearly termination due to a\ncontractual breach or exercise\nof other early termination\nright; or other factors,\nincluding bankruptcies,\nliquidations, restructurings,\nconsolidations or other\nsimilar events, whether due to\nthe ongoing impact of the\npandemic or otherwise (see the\npandemic-related risk factor\nabove).\n\nWhile various mitigating\nfactors could be available to\nCiti if any of the above\nevents were to occur\u2014such as\nby replacing the retailer or\nmerchant or offering other\ncard products\u2014these events,\nparticularly early termination\nand bankruptcies or\nliquidations, could negatively\nimpact the results of\noperations or financial\ncondition of branded cards,\nretail services or Citi as a\nwhole, including as a result\nof loss of revenues, increased\nexpenses, higher cost of\ncredit, impairment of\npurchased credit card\nrelationships and contract-\nrelated intangibles or other\nlosses (for information on\nCiti\u2019s credit card related\nintangibles generally, see\nNote 16 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\n\nCiti\u2019s Inability in Its\nResolution Plan Submissions to\nAddress Any Shortcomings or\nDeficiencies Identified or\nGuidance Provided by the FRB\nand FDIC Could Subject Citi to\nMore Stringent Capital,\nLeverage or Liquidity\nRequirements, or Restrictions\non Its Growth, Activities or\nOperations, and Could\nEventually Require Citi to\nDivest Assets or Operations.\n\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires Citi to prepare and\nsubmit a plan to the FRB and\nthe FDIC for the orderly\nresolution of Citigroup (the\nbank holding company) and its\nsignificant legal entities\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nin the event of future\nmaterial financial distress or\nfailure. The eight U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citi, filed their\nmost recent resolution plans\nwith the FRB and FDIC on July\n1, 2021. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\nresolution plan submissions,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and\nthe FDIC jointly determine\nthat Citi\u2019s resolution plan is\nnot \u201ccredible\u201d (which,\nalthough not defined, is\ngenerally believed to mean the\nregulators do not believe the\nplan is feasible or would\notherwise allow Citi to be\nresolved in a way that\nprotects systemically\nimportant functions without\nsevere systemic disruption),\nor would not facilitate an\norderly resolution of Citi\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, and Citi fails to\nresubmit a resolution plan\nthat remedies any identified\ndeficiencies, Citi could be\nsubjected to more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements, or restrictions\non its growth, activities or\noperations. If within two\nyears from the imposition of\nany such requirements or\nrestrictions Citi has still\nnot remediated any identified\ndeficiencies, then Citi could\neventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or\noperations. Any such\nrestrictions or actions would\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, market and\ninvestor perception,\noperations and strategy.\n\nCiti\u2019s Performance and the\nPerformance of Its Individual\nBusinesses Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if Citi Is Not Able\nto Effectively Compete for,\nRetain and Motivate Highly\nQualified Colleagues.\n\nRecent employment conditions\nhave made the competition to\nhire and retain qualified\nemployees significantly more\nchallenging. Citi\u2019s\nperformance and the\nperformance of its individual\nbusinesses largely depend on\nthe talents and efforts of its\ndiverse and highly qualified\ncolleagues. Specifically,\nCiti\u2019s continued ability to\ncompete in each of its lines\nof business, to manage its\nbusinesses effectively and to\nexecute its global strategy\ndepends on its ability to\nattract new colleagues and to\nretain and motivate its\nexisting colleagues. If Citi\nis unable to continue to\nattract, retain and motivate\nthe most highly qualified\ncolleagues, Citi\u2019s\nperformance, including its\ncompetitive position, the\nexecution of its strategy and\nits results of operations\ncould be negatively impacted.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate colleagues\ndepends on numerous factors,\nsome of which are outside of\nits control. For example, the\ncompetition for talent\nrecently has been particularly\nintense because of economic\nconditions associated with the\npandemic. Also, the banking\nindustry generally is subject\nto more comprehensive\nregulation of employee\ncompensation than other\nindustries, including deferral\nand clawback requirements for\nincentive compensation, which\ncan make it unusually\nchallenging for Citi to\ncompete in labor markets\nagainst businesses that are\nnot subject to such\nregulation. Citi often\ncompetes for talent with such\nbusinesses, including, among\nothers, technology companies.\nFurther, Citi\u2019s vaccination\nrequirement for its U.S.-based\nemployees could make it more\ndifficult to compete for or\nretain colleagues. Other\nfactors that could impact its\nability to attract, retain and\nmotivate colleagues include,\namong other things, Citi\u2019s\npresence in a particular\nmarket or region, the\nprofessional opportunities it\noffers and its reputation. For\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues and workforce\nmanagement, see \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFinancial Services Companies\nand Others as well as Emerging\nTechnologies Pose Increasingly\nCompetitive Challenges to\nCiti.\n\nCiti operates in an\nincreasingly evolving and\ncompetitive business\nenvironment, which includes\nboth financial and non-\nfinancial services firms, such\nas traditional banks, online\nbanks, financial technology\ncompanies and others. These\ncompanies compete on the basis\nof, among other factors, size,\nreach, quality and type of\nproducts and services offered,\nprice, technology and\nreputation. Certain\ncompetitors may be subject to\ndifferent and, in some cases,\nless stringent legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nplacing Citi at a competitive\ndisadvantage.\n\nCiti competes with financial\nservices companies in the U.S.\nand globally that continue to\ndevelop and introduce new\nproducts and services. In\nrecent years, non-financial\nservices firms, such as\nfinancial technology\ncompanies, have begun to offer\nservices traditionally\nprovided by financial\ninstitutions, such as Citi,\nand have sought bank charters\nto provide these services.\nThese firms attempt to use\ntechnology and mobile\nplatforms to enhance the\nability of companies and\nindividuals to borrow, save\nand invest money.\n\nMoreover, emerging\ntechnologies have the\npotential to intensify\ncompetition and accelerate\ndisruption in the financial\nservices industry. For\nexample, there is increasing\ninterest\n                               50                               \nfrom clients and investors in\ndigital assets such as\ncryptocurrencies. Financial\nservices firms and other\nmarket participants have begun\nto offer services related to\nthose assets such as custody\nand trading. However, Citi may\nnot be able to provide the\nsame or similar services for\nlegal or regulatory reasons\nand such services increase\ncompliance risk. In addition,\nchanges in the payments space\n(e.g., instant and 24x7\npayments) are accelerating,\nand, as a result, certain of\nCiti\u2019s products and services\ncould become less competitive.\n\nIn addition, as discussed\nabove, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic business\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted as a result of\nthe pandemic. Citi may\nexperience increased or\ndifferent competitive and\nother challenges in a post-\npandemic environment.\nIncreased competition and\nemerging technologies have\nrequired and could require\nCiti to change or adapt its\nproducts and services to\nattract and retain customers\nor clients or to compete more\neffectively with competitors,\nincluding new market entrants.\nSimultaneously, as Citi\ndevelops new products and\nservices leveraging emerging\ntechnologies, new risks may\nemerge that, if not designed\nand governed adequately, may\nresult in control gaps and in\nCiti operating outside of its\nrisk appetite. For example,\ninstant and 24x7 payments\nproducts could be accompanied\nby challenges to forecasting\nand managing liquidity, as\nwell as increased operational\nand compliance risks.\n\nTo the extent that Citi is not\nable to compete effectively\nwith financial technology\ncompanies and other firms,\nCiti could be placed at a\ncompetitive disadvantage,\nwhich could result in loss of\ncustomers and market share,\nand its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s competitors, see the\nco-brand and private label\ncards and qualified colleagues\nrisk factors above and\n\u201cSupervision, Regulation and\nOther\u2014Competition\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISKS                                             \n                                                                \nA Failure or Disruption of\nCiti\u2019s Operational Processes\nor Systems Could Negatively\nImpact Citi\u2019s Reputation,\nCustomers, Clients, Businesses\nor Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s global operations rely\nheavily on its technology,\nincluding the accurate, timely\nand secure processing,\nmanagement, storage and\ntransmission of confidential\ntransactions, data and other\ninformation as well as the\nmonitoring of a substantial\namount of data and complex\ntransactions in real time. For\nexample, Citi obtains and\nstores an extensive amount of\npersonal and client-specific\ninformation for its consumer\nand institutional customers\nand clients, and must\naccurately record and reflect\ntheir extensive account\ntransactions. Citi\u2019s\noperations must also comply\nwith complex and evolving laws\nand regulations in the\ncountries in which it\noperates.\n\nWith the evolving\nproliferation of new\ntechnologies and the\nincreasing use of the\ninternet, mobile devices and\ncloud technologies to conduct\nfinancial transactions, large\nglobal financial institutions\nsuch as Citi have been, and\nwill continue to be, subject\nto an ever-increasing risk of\noperational loss, failure or\ndisruption, including as a\nresult of cyber or information\nsecurity incidents. These\nrisks have been exacerbated\nduring the pandemic, when a\nsubstantial portion\n\nof Citi\u2019s colleagues have\nworked remotely and customers\nand clients have increased\ntheir use of online banking\nand other platforms (for\nadditional information, see\nthe pandemic-related risk\nfactor above and the\ncybersecurity risk factor\nbelow).\n\nAlthough Citi has continued to\nupgrade its technology,\nincluding systems to automate\nprocesses and enhance\nefficiencies, operational\nincidents are unpredictable\nand can arise from numerous\nsources, not all of which are\nfully within Citi\u2019s control.\nThese include, among others,\nhuman error, such as manual\ntransaction processing errors;\nfraud or malice on the part of\nemployees or third parties;\naccidental system or\ntechnological failure;\nelectrical or\ntelecommunication outages;\nfailures of or cyber incidents\ninvolving computer servers or\ninfrastructure; or other\nsimilar losses or damage to\nCiti\u2019s property or assets (see\nalso the climate change risk\nfactor below). For example,\nCiti has experienced and could\nexperience further losses\nassociated with manual\ntransaction processing errors\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cRevlon-Related Wire\nTransfer Litigation\u201d in Note\n27 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\n\nIrrespective of the\nsophistication of the\ntechnology utilized by Citi,\nthere will always be some room\nfor human error. In view of\nthe large transactions in\nwhich Citi engages, such\nerrors could result in\nsignificant loss.\n\nOperational incidents can also\narise as a result of failures\nby third parties with which\nCiti does business, such as\nfailures by internet, mobile\ntechnology and cloud service\nproviders or other vendors to\nadequately follow procedures\nor processes, safeguard their\nsystems or prevent system\ndisruptions or cyber attacks.\n\nIncidents that impact\ninformation security and/or\ntechnology operations may\ncause disruptions and/or\nmalfunctions within Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (e.g., the\ntemporary loss of availability\nof Citi\u2019s online banking\nsystem or mobile banking\nplatform), as well as the\noperations of its clients,\ncustomers or other third\nparties. In addition,\noperational incidents could\ninvolve the failure or\nineffectiveness of internal\nprocesses or controls.\n\nGiven Citi\u2019s global footprint\nand the high volume of\ntransactions processed by\nCiti, certain failures, errors\nor actions may be repeated or\ncompounded before they are\ndiscovered and rectified,\nwhich would further increase\nthe consequences and costs.\nOperational incidents could\nresult in financial losses as\nwell as misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\nconfidential and other\ninformation or assets, which\ncould significantly negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation,\ncustomers, clients, businesses\nor results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Cyber-\nrelated and other operational\nincidents can also result in\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings, fines and other\ncosts (see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of operational\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational Risk\u201d below.\n                               51                               \nCiti\u2019s and Third Parties\u2019\nComputer Systems and Networks\nHave Been, and Will Continue\nto Be, Susceptible to an\nIncreasing Risk of Continually\nEvolving, Sophisticated\nCybersecurity Activities That\nCould Result in the Theft,\nLoss, Misuse or Disclosure of\nConfidential Client or\nCustomer Information, Damage\nto Citi\u2019s Reputation,\nAdditional Costs to Citi,\nRegulatory Penalties, Legal\nExposure and Financial Losses.\n\nCiti\u2019s computer systems,\nsoftware and networks are\nsubject to ongoing cyber\nincidents such as unauthorized\naccess, loss or destruction of\ndata (including confidential\nclient information), account\ntakeovers, unavailability of\nservice, computer viruses or\nother malicious code, cyber\nattacks and other similar\nevents. These threats can\narise from external parties,\nincluding cyber criminals,\ncyber terrorists, hacktivists\nand nation-state actors, as\nwell as insiders who knowingly\nor unknowingly engage in or\nenable malicious cyber\nactivities.\n\nThird parties with which Citi\ndoes business, as well as\nretailers and other third\nparties with which Citi\u2019s\ncustomers do business, may\nalso be sources of\ncybersecurity risks,\nparticularly where activities\nof customers are beyond Citi\u2019s\nsecurity and control systems.\nFor example, Citi outsources\ncertain functions, such as\nprocessing customer credit\ncard transactions, uploading\ncontent on customer-facing\nwebsites and developing\nsoftware for new products and\nservices. These relationships\nallow for the storage and\nprocessing of customer\ninformation by third-party\nhosting of or access to Citi\nwebsites, which could lead to\ncompromise or the potential to\nintroduce vulnerable or\nmalicious code, resulting in\nsecurity breaches impacting\nCiti customers. Furthermore,\nbecause financial institutions\nare becoming increasingly\ninterconnected with central\nagents, exchanges and clearing\nhouses, including as a result\nof derivatives reforms over\nthe last few years, Citi has\nincreased exposure to cyber\nattacks through third parties.\nWhile many of Citi\u2019s\nagreements with third parties\ninclude indemnification\nprovisions, Citi may not be\nable to recover sufficiently,\nor at all, under the\nprovisions to adequately\noffset any losses Citi may\nincur from third-party cyber\nincidents.\n\nCiti has been subject to\nattempted and sometimes\nsuccessful cyber attacks from\nexternal sources over the last\nseveral years, including (i)\ndenial of service attacks,\nwhich attempt to interrupt\nservice to clients and\ncustomers, (ii) hacking and\nmalicious software\ninstallations, intended to\ngain unauthorized access to\ninformation systems or to\ndisrupt those systems, (iii)\ndata breaches due to\nunauthorized access to\ncustomer account data and (iv)\nmalicious software attacks on\nclient systems, in an attempt\nto gain unauthorized access to\nCiti systems or client data\nunder the guise of normal\nclient transactions. While\nCiti\u2019s monitoring and\nprotection services were able\nto detect and respond to the\nincidents targeting its\nsystems before they became\nsignificant, they still\nresulted in limited losses in\nsome instances as well as\nincreases in expenditures to\nmonitor against the threat of\nsimilar future cyber\nincidents. There can be no\nassurance that such cyber\nincidents will not occur\nagain, and they could occur\nmore frequently and on a more\nsignificant scale.\n\nFurther, although Citi devotes\nsignificant resources to\nimplement, maintain, monitor\nand regularly upgrade its\nsystems and networks with\nmeasures such as intrusion\ndetection and prevention and\nfirewalls to safeguard\ncritical\n\nbusiness applications, there\nis no guarantee that these\nmeasures or any other measures\ncan provide absolute security.\nBecause the methods used to\ncause cyber attacks change\nfrequently or, in some cases,\nare not recognized until\nlaunched or even later, Citi\nmay be unable to implement\neffective preventive measures\nor proactively address these\nmethods until they are\ndiscovered. In addition, given\nthe evolving nature of cyber\nthreat actors and the\nfrequency and sophistication\nof the cyber activities they\ncarry out, the determination\nof the severity and potential\nimpact of a cyber incident may\nnot become apparent for a\nsubstantial period of time\nfollowing discovery of the\nincident. Also, while Citi\nengages in certain actions to\nreduce the exposure resulting\nfrom outsourcing, such as\nperforming security control\nassessments of third-party\nvendors and limiting third-\nparty access to the least\nprivileged level necessary to\nperform job functions, these\nactions cannot prevent all\nthird-party-related cyber\nattacks or data breaches.\n\nCyber incidents can result in\nthe disclosure of personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ncustomer or client\ninformation, damage to Citi\u2019s\nreputation with its clients\nand the market, customer\ndissatisfaction and additional\ncosts to Citi, including\nexpenses such as repairing\nsystems, replacing customer\npayment cards, credit\nmonitoring or adding new\npersonnel or protection\ntechnologies. Regulatory\npenalties, loss of revenues,\nexposure to litigation and\nother financial losses,\nincluding loss of funds, to\nboth Citi and its clients and\ncustomers and disruption to\nCiti\u2019s operational systems\ncould also result from cyber\nincidents (for additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of operational\ndisruptions, see the\noperational processes and\nsystems risk factor above).\nMoreover, the increasing risk\nof cyber incidents has\nresulted in increased\nlegislative and regulatory\nscrutiny of firms\u2019\ncybersecurity protection\nservices and calls for\nadditional laws and\nregulations to further enhance\nprotection of consumers\u2019\npersonal data.\n\nWhile Citi maintains insurance\ncoverage that may, subject to\npolicy terms and conditions\nincluding significant self-\ninsured deductibles, cover\ncertain aspects of cyber\nrisks, such insurance coverage\nmay be insufficient to cover\nall losses and may not take\ninto account reputational\nharm, the cost of which could\nbe immeasurable.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s management of\ncybersecurity risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nChanges to or the Application\nof Incorrect Assumptions,\nJudgments or Estimates in\nCiti\u2019s Financial Statements\nCould Cause Significant\nUnexpected Losses or Impacts\nin the Future.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use\ncertain assumptions, judgments\nand estimates in preparing its\nfinancial statements,\nincluding, among other items,\nthe estimate of the ACL;\nreserves related to\nlitigation, regulatory and tax\nmatters exposures; valuation\nof DTAs; the fair values of\ncertain assets and\nliabilities; and the\nassessment of goodwill or\nother assets for impairment.\nIf Citi\u2019s assumptions,\njudgments or estimates\nunderlying its financial\nstatements are incorrect or\ndiffer from actual or\nsubsequent events, Citi could\nexperience unexpected\n                               52                               \nlosses or other adverse\nimpacts, some of which could\nbe significant.\n\nFor example, the CECL\nmethodology requires that Citi\nprovide reserves for a current\nestimate of lifetime expected\ncredit losses for its loan\nportfolios and other financial\nassets, as applicable, at the\ntime those assets are\noriginated or acquired. This\nestimate is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. Citi\u2019s\nACL estimate depends upon its\nCECL models and assumptions,\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, including, among\nother things, U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S.\nReal GDP, and the credit\nindicators, composition and\nother characteristics of\nCiti\u2019s loan and other\napplicable financial assets.\nThese model assumptions and\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions will change over\ntime, whether due to the\npandemic or otherwise,\nresulting in greater\nvariability in Citi\u2019s ACL\ncompared to its provision for\nloan losses under the previous\nGAAP methodology, and, thus,\nimpact its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, as well as\nregulatory capital due to the\nCECL phase-in beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred\nlosses related to its foreign\noperations that are reported\nin the CTA components of\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) . In accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial\nliquidation or any other\ndeconsolidation event of any\nforeign operations, such as\nthose related to Citi\u2019s legacy\nor exit businesses, would\nresult in reclassification of\nany foreign CTA component of\nAOCI related to that foreign\noperation, including related\nhedges and taxes, into Citi\u2019s\nearnings. For example, Citi\nincurred a pretax loss of\napproximately $680 million\n($580 million after-tax) in\nthe third quarter of 2021\nrelated to the sale of Citi\u2019s\nAustralia consumer banking\nbusiness in Asia GCB ,\nprimarily reflecting the\nimpact of a CTA loss.

For additional\ninformation on the key areas\nfor which assumptions and\nestimates are used in\npreparing Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements, including those\nrelated to Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 27 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nChanges to Financial\nAccounting and Reporting\nStandards or Interpretations\nCould Have a Material Impact\non How Citi Records and\nReports Its Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issues financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards that govern key\naspects of Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements or interpretations\nthereof when those standards\nbecome effective, including\nthose areas where Citi is\nrequired to make assumptions\nor estimates. Changes to\nfinancial accounting or\nreporting standards or\ninterpretations, whether\npromulgated or required by the\nFASB or other regulators,\ncould present operational\nchallenges and could also\nrequire Citi to change certain\nof the assumptions or\nestimates it previously used\nin preparing its financial\nstatements, which could\nnegatively impact how it\nrecords and reports its\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations\ngenerally and/or with respect\nto particular businesses. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s accounting\n\npolicies and changes in\naccounting, including the\nexpected impacts on Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, see Note\n1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s Risk Management\nProcesses, Strategies or\nModels Are Deficient or\nIneffective, Citi May Incur\nSignificant Losses and Its\nRegulatory Capital and Capital\nRatios Could Be Negatively\nImpacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and\ndiversified set of risk\nmanagement and mitigation\nprocesses and strategies,\nincluding use of models in\nenacting processes and\nstrategies as well as in\nanalyzing and monitoring the\nvarious risks Citi assumes in\nconducting its activities. For\nexample, Citi uses models as\npart of its comprehensive\nstress testing initiatives\nacross the Company. Citi also\nrelies on data to aggregate,\nassess and manage various risk\nexposures. Management of these\nrisks is made even more\nchallenging within a global\nfinancial institution such as\nCiti, particularly given the\ncomplex, diverse and rapidly\nchanging financial markets and\nconditions in which Citi\noperates as well as that\nlosses can occur\nunintentionally from untimely,\ninaccurate or incomplete\nprocesses.\n\nIn addition, in October 2020,\nCitigroup and Citibank entered\ninto consent orders with the\nFRB and OCC that require\nCitigroup and Citibank to make\nimprovements in various\naspects of enterprise-wide\nrisk management, compliance,\ndata quality management and\ngovernance and internal\ncontrols (see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent\nOrder Compliance\u201d above and\nthe legal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nCiti\u2019s risk management\nprocesses, strategies and\nmodels are inherently limited\nbecause they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, assumptions and\njudgments that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, nor can they\nanticipate the specifics and\ntiming of such outcomes. Citi\ncould incur significant\nlosses, and its regulatory\ncapital and capital ratios\ncould be negatively impacted,\nif Citi\u2019s risk management\nprocesses, including its\nability to manage and\naggregate data in a timely and\naccurate manner, strategies or\nmodels are deficient or\nineffective. Such deficiencies\nor ineffectiveness could also\nresult in inaccurate\nfinancial, regulatory or risk\nreporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Basel III\nregulatory capital models,\nincluding its credit, market\nand operational risk models,\ncurrently remain subject to\nongoing regulatory review and\napproval, which may result in\nrefinements, modifications or\nenhancements (required or\notherwise) to these models.\nModifications or requirements\nresulting from these ongoing\nreviews, as well as any future\nchanges or guidance provided\nby the U.S. banking agencies\nregarding the regulatory\ncapital framework applicable\nto Citi, have resulted in, and\ncould continue to result in,\nsignificant changes to Citi\u2019s\nrisk- weighted assets. These\nchanges can negatively impact\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and its\nability to achieve its\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n                               53                               \n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISKS                                                  \n                                                                \nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nof Risk Can Increase the\nPotential for Citi to Incur\nSignificant Losses.\n\nCredit risk primarily arises\nfrom Citi\u2019s lending and other\nbusinesses in both ICG and GCB\n. Citi has credit exposures to\nconsumer, corporate and public\nsector borrowers and other\ncounterparties in the U.S. and\nvarious countries and\njurisdictions globally,\nincluding end-of-period\nconsumer loans of $271 billion\nand end-of-period corporate\nloans of $397 billion at year-\nend 2021.\n\nA default by a borrower or\nother counterparty, or a\ndecline in the credit quality\nor value of any underlying\ncollateral, exposes Citi to\ncredit risk. Despite Citi\u2019s\ntarget client strategy,\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nfactors, among other things,\ncan increase Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk and credit costs,\nparticularly for certain\nsectors, industries or\ncountries (for additional\ninformation, see the pandemic-\nrelated, co-branding and\nprivate label credit card and\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties risk factors\nabove and the emerging markets\nrisk factor below). For\nexample, a weakening of\neconomic conditions, including\nhigher unemployment levels,\ncan adversely affect\nborrowers\u2019 ability to repay\ntheir obligations. In\naddition, weakening economic\nconditions may result in Citi\nbeing unable to liquidate its\ncollateral, as well as\ndisputes with counterparties\nregarding the valuation of\ncollateral Citi holds and Citi\nbeing unable to realize the\nfair value of such collateral.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves\nfor expected losses for its\ncredit exposures, as\napplicable, such reserves are\nsubject to judgments and\nestimates that could be\nincorrect or differ from\nactual future events. Under\nthe CECL accounting standard,\nthe ACL reflects expected\nlosses, rather than incurred\nlosses, which has resulted in\nand could lead to additional\nvolatility in the allowance\nand the provision for credit\nlosses as forecasts of\neconomic conditions change. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s future\nallowance may be affected by\nseasonality of its cards\nportfolio balances based on\nhistorical evidence showing\nthat (i) credit card balances\ntypically decrease during the\nfirst and second quarters, as\nborrowers use tax refunds to\npay down balances; and (ii)\nbalances increase during the\nthird and fourth quarters each\nyear as payments are no longer\nimpacted by tax refunds and\nthe holiday season approaches.\nHowever, these seasonal trends\ncould be affected in 2022 due\nto the impacts of the\npandemic, government stimulus\nand expiration of consumer and\nsmall business relief\nprograms. For additional\ninformation, see the incorrect\nassumptions or estimates and\nchanges to financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards risk factors above.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\nand country risk, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u201d and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u201d\nbelow and Notes 14 and 15 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nConcentrations of risk to\nclients or counterparties\nengaged in the same or related\nindustries or doing business\nin a particular geography,\nespecially credit and market\nrisks, can also increase\nCiti\u2019s risk of significant\nlosses. As of year-end\n\n2021, Citi\u2019s most significant\nconcentration of credit risk\nwas with the U.S. government\nand its agencies, which\nprimarily results from trading\nassets and investments issued\nby the U.S. government and its\nagencies (for additional\ninformation, including\nconcentrations of credit risk\nto other public sector\nentities, see Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). In addition, Citi\nroutinely executes a high\nvolume of securities, trading,\nderivative and foreign\nexchange transactions with\nnon-U.S. sovereigns and with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding banks, insurance\ncompanies, investment banks,\ngovernments, central banks and\nother financial institutions.\nMoreover, Citi has\nindemnification obligations in\nconnection with various\ntransactions that expose it to\nconcentrations of risk,\nincluding credit risk from\nhedging or reinsurance\narrangements related to those\nobligations (for additional\ninformation about these\nexposures, see Note 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). A rapid\ndeterioration of a large\nborrower or other counterparty\nor within a sector or country\nin which Citi has large\nexposures or indemnifications\nor unexpected market\ndislocations could cause Citi\nto incur significant losses.\n                                                                \n  LIQUIDITY RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nThe Maintenance of Adequate\nLiquidity and Funding Depends\non Numerous Factors, Including\nThose Outside of Citi\u2019s\nControl, Such as Market\nDisruptions and Increases in\nCiti\u2019s Credit Spreads.\n\nAs a large, global financial\ninstitution, adequate\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding are essential to\nCiti\u2019s businesses. Citi\u2019s\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding can be significantly\nand negatively impacted by\nfactors it cannot control,\nsuch as general disruptions in\nthe financial markets,\ngovernmental fiscal and\nmonetary policies, regulatory\nchanges or negative investor\nperceptions of Citi\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, unexpected\nincreases in cash or\ncollateral requirements and\nthe inability to monetize\navailable liquidity resources,\nwhether due to the pandemic or\notherwise. Citi competes with\nother banks and financial\ninstitutions for both\ninstitutional and consumer\ndeposits, which represent\nCiti\u2019s most stable and lowest\ncost source of long-term\nfunding. The competition for\ndeposits has continued to\nincrease in recent years,\nincluding, among others, as a\nresult of online banks and\ndigital banking. Furthermore,\nalthough Citi has had robust\ndeposit growth since the onset\nof the pandemic, it remains\nunclear how \u201csticky\u201d (likely\nto remain at Citi) those\ndeposits may be, particularly\nin a less monetarily\naccommodative environment.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s costs to\nobtain and access secured\nfunding and long-term\nunsecured funding are directly\nrelated to its credit spreads\nand changes in interest and\ncurrency exchange rates.\nChanges in credit spreads are\ndriven by both external market\nfactors and factors specific\nto Citi, such as negative\nviews by investors of the\nfinancial services industry or\nCiti\u2019s financial prospects,\nand can be highly volatile.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s primary sources of\nfunding, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to obtain\nfunding may be impaired and\nits cost of funding could\nincrease if other market\nparticipants are seeking to\naccess the markets at the same\ntime, or if market appetite\ndeclines, as is likely to\noccur in a liquidity stress\nevent or other market crisis.\nA sudden drop in market\nliquidity could\n                               54                               \nalso cause a temporary or\nlengthier dislocation of\nunderwriting and capital\nmarkets activity. In addition,\nclearing organizations,\ncentral banks, clients and\nfinancial institutions with\nwhich Citi interacts may\nexercise the right to require\nadditional collateral based on\ntheir perceptions or the\nmarket conditions, which could\nfurther impair Citi\u2019s access\nto and cost of funding.\n\nIn addition, as a holding\ncompany, Citi relies on\ninterest, dividends,\ndistributions and other\npayments from its subsidiaries\nto fund dividends as well as\nto satisfy its debt and other\nobligations. Several of Citi\u2019s\nU.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries\nare or may be subject to\ncapital adequacy or other\nliquidity, regulatory or\ncontractual restrictions on\ntheir ability to provide such\npayments, including any local\nregulatory stress test\nrequirements. Citi\u2019s broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions on\ntheir ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates, as\nwell as restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited\nwith them in brokerage or bank\naccounts to fund their\nbusinesses. Limitations on the\npayments that Citi receives\nfrom its subsidiaries could\nalso impact its liquidity. A\nbank holding company is\nrequired by law to act as a\nsource of financial and\nmanagerial strength for its\nsubsidiary banks. As a result,\nthe FRB may require Citi to\ncommit resources to its\nsubsidiary banks even if doing\nso is not otherwise in the\ninterests of Citi or its\nshareholders or creditors,\nreducing the amount of funds\navailable to meet its\nobligations. In addition, in\nthe event of a subsidiary\u2019s\nliquidation or reorganization,\nCiti\u2019s right to participate in\na distribution of such\nsubsidiary\u2019s assets is subject\nto the prior claims of the\nsubsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\nThe Credit Rating Agencies\nContinuously Review the Credit\nRatings of Citi and Certain of\nIts Subsidiaries, and a\nRatings Downgrade Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi\u2019s\nFunding and Liquidity Due to\nReduced Funding Capacity and\nIncreased Funding Costs,\nIncluding Derivatives Triggers\nThat Could Require Cash\nObligations or Collateral\nRequirements.\n\nThe credit rating agencies,\nsuch as Fitch, Moody\u2019s and S&P\nGlobal Ratings, continuously\nevaluate Citi and certain of\nits subsidiaries. Their\nratings of Citi and its more\nsignificant subsidiaries\u2019\nlong-term/ senior debt and\nshort-term/commercial paper\nare based on a number of\nfactors, including standalone\nfinancial strength, as well as\nfactors that are not entirely\nwithin the control of Citi and\nits subsidiaries, such as the\nagencies\u2019 proprietary rating\nmethodologies and assumptions,\nand conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry\nand markets generally.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may\nnot be able to maintain their\ncurrent respective ratings. A\nratings downgrade could\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nability to access the capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds as well as the costs of\nthose funds, and its ability\nto maintain certain deposits.\nA ratings downgrade could also\nhave a negative impact on\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\ndue to reduced funding\ncapacity and the impact from\nderivative triggers, which\ncould require Citi to meet\ncash obligations and\ncollateral requirements. In\naddition, a ratings downgrade\ncould have a negative impact\non other funding sources such\nas secured financing and other\nmargined transactions for\nwhich there may be no explicit\ntriggers, and\n\non contractual provisions and\nother credit requirements of\nCiti\u2019s counterparties and\nclients that may contain\nminimum ratings thresholds in\norder for Citi to hold third-\nparty funds. Some entities\ncould have ratings limitations\non their permissible\ncounterparties, of which Citi\nmay or may not be aware.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings\ndowngrade could have impacts\nthat may not be currently\nknown to Citi or are not\npossible to quantify. Certain\nof Citi\u2019s corporate customers\nand trading counterparties,\namong other clients, could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit the trading of certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi in\nresponse to ratings\ndowngrades. Changes in\ncustomer and counterparty\nbehavior could impact not only\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nbut also the results of\noperations of certain Citi\nbusinesses. For additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of a reduction in\nCiti\u2019s or Citibank\u2019s credit\nratings, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISKS                                              \n                                                                \nOngoing Interpretation and\nImplementation of Regulatory\nand Legislative Requirements\nand Changes and Heightened\nRegulatory Scrutiny and\nExpectations in the U.S. and\nGlobally Have Increased Citi\u2019s\nCompliance, Regulatory and\nOther Risks and Costs.\n\nCiti is continually required\nto interpret and implement\nextensive and frequently\nchanging regulatory and\nlegislative requirements in\nthe U.S. and other\njurisdictions in which it does\nbusiness, resulting in\nsubstantial compliance,\nregulatory and other risks and\ncosts. In addition, there are\nheightened regulatory scrutiny\nand expectations in the U.S.\nand globally for large\nfinancial institutions, as\nwell as their employees and\nagents, with respect to\ngovernance, infrastructure,\ndata and risk management\npractices and controls. These\nrequirements and expectations\nalso include, among other\nthings, those related to\ncustomer and client\nprotection, market practices,\nanti-money laundering and\nsanctions. A failure to comply\nwith these requirements and\nexpectations or resolve any\nidentified deficiencies could\nresult in increased regulatory\noversight and restrictions,\nenforcement proceedings,\npenalties and fines (for\nadditional information, see\nthe legal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nOver the past several years,\nCiti has been required to\nimplement a significant number\nof regulatory and legislative\nchanges across all of its\nbusinesses and functions, and\nthese changes continue. The\nchanges themselves may be\ncomplex and subject to\ninterpretation, and will\nrequire continued investments\nin Citi\u2019s global operations\nand technology solutions. In\nsome cases, Citi\u2019s\nimplementation of a regulatory\nor legislative requirement is\noccurring simultaneously with\nchanging or conflicting\nregulatory guidance, legal\nchallenges or legislative\naction to modify or repeal\nexisting rules or enact new\nrules. Moreover, in some\ncases, there have been\nentirely new regulatory or\nlegislative requirements or\nregimes, resulting in large\nvolumes of regulation and\npotential uncertainty\nregarding regulatory\nexpectations for compliance.\n\nExamples of regulatory or\nlegislative changes that have\nresulted in increased\ncompliance risks and costs\ninclude (i) various laws\nrelating to the limitation of\ncross-border data movement\nand/or collection and use of\ncustomer information,\n                               55                               \nincluding data localization\nand protection and privacy\nlaws, which also can conflict\nwith or increase compliance\ncomplexity with respect to\nother laws, including anti-\nmoney laundering laws; (ii)\nthe FRB\u2019s \u201ctotal loss\nabsorbing capacity\u201d (TLAC)\nrequirements; and (iii) the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019\nregulatory capital rules and\nrequirements, which have\ncontinued to evolve (for\nadditional information, see\nthe capital return risk factor\nand \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nabove). In addition, the U.S.\nbanking agencies have\nprioritized issues of social,\neconomic and racial justice,\nand are in the process of\nconsidering ways in which\nthese issues can be mitigated,\nincluding through rulemaking,\nsupervision and other means.\n\nIncreased and ongoing\ncompliance and regulatory\nrequirements, uncertainties,\nscrutiny and expectations have\nresulted in higher compliance\ncosts for Citi, in part due to\nan increase in risk,\nregulatory and compliance\nstaff over the last several\nyears. Extensive and changing\ncompliance requirements can\nalso result in increased\nreputational and legal risks\nfor Citi, as failure to comply\nwith regulations and\nrequirements, or failure to\ncomply with regulatory\nexpectations, can result in\nenforcement and/or regulatory\nproceedings, penalties and\nfines.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive\nLegal and Regulatory\nProceedings, Examinations,\nInvestigations, Consent Orders\nand Related Compliance Efforts\nand Other Inquiries That Could\nResult in Significant Monetary\nPenalties, Supervisory or\nEnforcement Orders, Business\nRestrictions, Limitations on\nDividends, Changes to\nDirectors and/or Officers and\nCollateral Consequences\nArising from Such Outcomes.\n\nAt any given time, Citi is a\nparty to a significant number\nof legal and regulatory\nproceedings and is subject to\nnumerous governmental and\nregulatory examinations,\ninvestigations, consent orders\nand related compliance\nefforts, and other inquiries.\nCiti can also be subject to\nenforcement proceedings not\nonly because of violations of\nlaws and regulations, but also\ndue to failures, as determined\nby its regulators, to have\nadequate policies and\nprocedures, or to remedy\ndeficiencies on a timely\nbasis.\n\nThe October 2020 FRB and OCC\nconsent orders require\nCitigroup and Citibank to\nimplement targeted action\nplans and quarterly progress\nreports detailing the results\nand status of improvements\nrelating principally to\nvarious aspects of enterprise-\nwide risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance and\ninternal controls. These\nimprovements will result in\ncontinued significant\ninvestments by Citi during\n2022 and beyond, as an\nessential part of Citi\u2019s\nbroader transformation efforts\nto enhance its infrastructure,\ngovernance, processes and risk\nand controls.\n\nAlthough there are no\nrestrictions on Citi\u2019s ability\nto serve its clients, the OCC\nconsent order requires\nCitibank to obtain prior\napproval of any significant\nnew acquisition, including any\nportfolio or business\nacquisition, excluding\nordinary course transactions.\nMoreover, the OCC consent\norder provides that the OCC\nhas the right to assess future\ncivil money penalties or take\nother supervisory and/or\nenforcement actions, including\nwhere the OCC determines\nCitibank has not made\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress to address the\nrequired improvements. Such\nactions by the OCC could\ninclude imposing business\nrestrictions, including\npossible\n\nlimitations on the declaration\nor payment of dividends and\nchanges in directors and/or\nsenior executive officers.\nMore generally, the OCC and/or\nthe FRB could take additional\nenforcement or other actions\nif the regulatory agency\nbelieves that Citi has not met\nregulatory expectations\nregarding compliance with the\nconsent orders. For additional\ninformation regarding the\nconsent orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove.\n\nThe global judicial,\nregulatory and political\nenvironment has generally been\nchallenging for large\nfinancial institutions. The\ncomplexity of the federal and\nstate regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the global\nscope of Citi\u2019s operations,\nalso means that a single event\nor issue may give rise to a\nlarge number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state\nagencies and authorities in\nthe U.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\ndifferent jurisdictions, as\nwell as multiple civil\nlitigation claims in multiple\njurisdictions.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators\nhave been increasingly focused\non \u201cconduct risk,\u201d a term used\nto describe the risks\nassociated with behavior by\nemployees and agents,\nincluding third parties, that\ncould harm clients, customers,\nemployees or the integrity of\nthe markets, such as\nimproperly creating, selling,\nmarketing or managing products\nand services or improper\nincentive compensation\nprograms with respect thereto,\nfailures to safeguard a\nparty\u2019s personal information,\nor failures to identify and\nmanage conflicts of interest.\nIn addition to the greater\nfocus on conduct risk, the\ngeneral heightened scrutiny\nand expectations from\nregulators could lead to\ninvestigations and other\ninquiries, as well as\nremediation requirements, more\nregulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings, civil\nlitigation and higher\ncompliance and other risks and\ncosts.\n\nFurther, while Citi takes\nnumerous steps to prevent and\ndetect conduct by employees\nand agents that could\npotentially harm clients,\ncustomers, employees or the\nintegrity of the markets, such\nbehavior may not always be\ndeterred or prevented. Banking\nregulators have also focused\non the overall culture of\nfinancial services firms,\nincluding Citi.\n\nIn addition to regulatory\nrestrictions or structural\nchanges that could result from\nperceived deficiencies in\nCiti\u2019s culture, such focus\ncould also lead to additional\nregulatory proceedings.\nFurthermore, the severity of\nthe remedies sought in legal\nand regulatory proceedings to\nwhich Citi is subject has\nremained elevated. U.S. and\ncertain non-U.S. governmental\nentities have increasingly\nbrought criminal actions\nagainst, or have sought\ncriminal convictions from,\nfinancial institutions and\nindividual employees, and\ncriminal prosecutors in the\nU.S. have increasingly sought\nand obtained criminal guilty\npleas or deferred prosecution\nagreements against corporate\nentities and individuals and\nother criminal sanctions for\nthose institutions and\nindividuals. These types of\nactions by U.S. and\ninternational governmental\nentities may, in the future,\nhave significant collateral\nconsequences for a financial\ninstitution, including loss of\ncustomers and business, and\nthe inability to offer certain\nproducts or services and/or\noperate certain businesses.\nCiti may be required to accept\nor be subject to similar types\nof criminal remedies, consent\norders, sanctions, substantial\nfines and penalties,\nremediation and other\nfinancial\n                               56                               \ncosts or other requirements in\nthe future, including for\nmatters or practices not yet\nknown to Citi, any of which\ncould materially and\nnegatively affect Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, business\npractices, financial condition\nor results of operations,\nrequire material changes in\nCiti\u2019s operations or cause\nCiti reputational harm.\n\nFurther, many large\nclaims\u2014both private civil and\nregulatory\u2014asserted against\nCiti are highly complex, slow\nto develop and may involve\nnovel or untested legal\ntheories. The outcome of such\nproceedings is difficult to\npredict or estimate until late\nin the proceedings. Although\nCiti establishes accruals for\nits legal and regulatory\nmatters according to\naccounting requirements,\nCiti\u2019s estimates of, and\nchanges to, these accruals\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, and\nthe amount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher than the amounts\naccrued (see the incorrect\nassumptions or estimates risk\nfactor above). In addition,\ncertain settlements are\nsubject to court approval and\nmay not be approved.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Presence in the\nEmerging Markets Subjects It\nto Various Risks as well as\nIncreased Compliance and\nRegulatory Risks and Costs.\n\nDuring 2021, emerging markets\nrevenues accounted for\napproximately 35% of Citi\u2019s\ntotal revenues (Citi generally\ndefines emerging markets as\ncountries in Latin America ,\nAsia (other than Japan,\nAustralia and New Zealand),\nand central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East and\nAfrica in EMEA ).\n\nAlthough Citi continues to\npursue its target client\nstrategy, Citi\u2019s presence in\nthe emerging markets subjects\nit to various risks, such as\nlimitations or unavailability\nof hedges on foreign\ninvestments; foreign currency\nvolatility, including\ndevaluations, sovereign\nvolatility, election outcomes,\nregulatory changes and\npolitical events; foreign\nexchange controls, including\ninability to access indirect\nforeign exchange mechanisms;\nmacroeconomic volatility and\ndisruptions, including with\nrespect to commodity prices;\nlimitations on foreign\ninvestment; sociopolitical\ninstability (including from\nhyperinflation); fraud;\nnationalization or loss of\nlicenses; business\nrestrictions; sanctions or\nasset freezes; potential\ncriminal charges; closure of\nbranches or subsidiaries; and\nconfiscation of assets,\nwhether related to\ngeopolitical conflicts or\notherwise; and these risks can\nbe exacerbated in the event of\na deterioration in\nrelationships between the U.S.\nand an emerging market\ncountry. For example, Citi\noperates in several countries\nthat have, or have had in the\npast, strict capital and\ncurrency controls, such as\nArgentina, that limit its\nability to convert local\ncurrency into U.S. dollars\nand/or transfer funds outside\nof those countries. Among\nother things, Citi faces a\nrisk of devaluation on its\nunhedged Argentine peso-\ndenominated assets, which\ncontinue to increase (for\nfurther information on this\nand other risks, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow).\n\nMoreover, if the economic\nsituation in an emerging\nmarkets country in which Citi\noperates were to deteriorate\nbelow a certain level, U.S.\nregulators may impose\nmandatory loan loss or other\nreserve requirements on Citi,\nwhich would\n\nincrease its credit costs and\ndecrease its earnings (for\nfurther information, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow).\n\nIn addition, political turmoil\nand instability have occurred\nin various regions and\nemerging market countries\nacross the globe which have\nrequired, and may continue to\nrequire, management time and\nattention and other resources\n(such as monitoring the impact\nof sanctions on certain\nemerging markets economies as\nwell as impacting Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of\noperations in affected\ncountries).\n\nClimate Change Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi\u2019s\nResults of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti operates in countries,\nstates and regions in which\nmany of its businesses, and\nthe activities of many of its\ncustomers and clients, are\nexposed to the adverse impacts\nof climate change, as well as\nuncertainties related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Climate change\npresents both immediate and\nlong-term risks to Citi and\nits customers and clients,\nwith the risks expected to\nincrease over time.\n\nClimate risks can arise from\nboth physical risks (those\nrisks related to the physical\neffects of climate change) and\ntransition risks (risks\nrelated to regulatory,\ncompliance, technological,\nstakeholder and legal changes\nfrom a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy). The physical\nand transition risks can\nmanifest themselves\ndifferently across Citi\u2019s risk\ncategories in the short,\nmedium and long terms.\n\nThe physical risk from climate\nchange could result from\nincreased frequency and/or\nseverity of adverse weather\nevents. For example, adverse\nweather events could damage or\ndestroy Citi\u2019s or its\ncounterparties\u2019 properties and\nother assets and disrupt\noperations, making it more\ndifficult for counterparties\nto repay their obligations,\nwhether due to reduced\nprofitability, asset\ndevaluations or otherwise.\nThese events could also\nincrease the volatility in\nfinancial markets affecting\nCiti\u2019s trading businesses and\nincrease its counterparty\nexposures and other financial\nrisks, which may result in\nlower revenues and higher cost\nof credit.\n\nTransition risks may arise\nfrom changes in regulations or\nmarket preferences toward a\nlow-carbon economy, which in\nturn could have negative\nimpacts on asset values,\nresults of operations or the\nreputations of Citi and its\ncustomers and clients. For\nexample, Citi\u2019s corporate\ncredit exposures include oil\nand gas, power and other\nindustries that may experience\nreduced demand for carbon-\nintensive products due to the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Moreover, U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banking regulators\nand others are increasingly\nfocusing on the issue of\nclimate risk at financial\ninstitutions, both directly\nand with respect to their\nclients. As an example, on\nDecember 16, 2021, the OCC\nrequested feedback on draft\nprinciples designed to support\nthe identification and\nmanagement of climate-related\nfinancial risks at\ninstitutions with more than\n$100 billion in total\nconsolidated assets.\n\nEven as regulators begin to\nmandate additional disclosure\nof climate-related information\nby companies across sectors,\nthere may continue to be a\nlack of information for more\nrobust climate-related risk\nanalyses. Third party\nexposures to climate-related\nrisks and other data generally\nare limited in availability\nand variable in quality.\nModeling capabilities to\nanalyze climate-related risks\nand interconnections are\nimproving but\n                               57                               \nremain incomplete. Legislative\nor regulatory uncertainties\nand changes regarding climate-\nrelated risk management and\ndisclosures are likely to\nresult in higher regulatory,\ncompliance, credit,\nreputational and other risks\nand costs (for additional\ninformation, see the ongoing\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes risk\nfactor above). In addition,\nCiti could face increased\nregulatory, reputational and\nlegal scrutiny as a result of\nits climate risk,\nsustainability and other ESG\nrelated commitments.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nclimate and other\nsustainability initiatives,\nsee \u201cSustainability and Other\nESG Matters\u201d below. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s management of climate\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Climate Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nThe Transition Away from and\nDiscontinuance of the London\nInter-Bank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) and Any Other Interest\nRate Benchmark Could Have\nAdverse Consequences for\nMarket Participants, Including\nCiti.\n\nFor decades, LIBOR and other\nrates or indices deemed to be\nbenchmarks have been widely\nused across financial products\nand markets globally. These\nbenchmarks have been the\nsubject of ongoing national\nand international regulatory\nscrutiny and reform, resulting\nin regulators generally\nexpecting or requiring banks,\nincluding Citi, to cease\nentering into new contracts\nthat reference USD LIBOR as a\nbenchmark by December 31,\n2021. The LIBOR administrator\nceased publication of non-USD\nLIBOR and one-week and two-\nmonth USD LIBOR on a\nrepresentative basis on\nDecember 31, 2021, with plans\nto cease publication of all\nother USD LIBOR tenors on June\n30, 2023. As a result, Citi\nceased entering into new\ncontracts referencing USD\nLIBOR as of January 1, 2022,\nother than for limited\npurposes as permitted by\nregulatory guidance.\n\nLIBOR and other benchmarks\nhave been used in a\nsubstantial number of Citi\u2019s\noutstanding securities and\nproducts, including , among\nothers, derivatives, corporate\nloans, commercial and\nresidential mortgages, credit\ncards, securitized products\nand other structured\nsecurities. Despite ongoing\nactions to prepare for the\ntransition away from LIBOR\n(see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014LIBOR\nTransition Risk\u201d below),\nmarket participants, including\nCiti, may not be adequately\nprepared for uncertainties\nassociated with these\nbenchmarks\u2019 discontinuance or,\nas necessary, be able to\nsuccessfully modify their\noutstanding contracts or\nproducts that reference these\nbenchmarks. For example , the\ntransition away from and\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR or any\nother benchmark rate presents\nvarious uncertainties and\noperational, legal,\nreputational or compliance,\nfinancial and other risks and\nchallenges to holders of these\ncontracts and products, as\nwell as financial markets and\ninstitutions, including Citi.\nThese include, among others,\nthe pricing, liquidity,\nobservability, value of,\nreturn on and market for\nfinancial instruments and\ncontracts that reference LIBOR\nor any other benchmark rate.\n\nWhile Citi has adopted\nalternative reference rates\nfor new contracts to replace\nthese outgoing benchmarks, in\nsome instances, it is possible\nthat the characteristics of\nthese new rates may not be\nsufficiently similar to, or\nproduce the economic\nequivalent of, the benchmark\nrates that they are intended\nto replace. Alternative\nreference rates, such as the\n\nSecured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR), are calculated\nusing components different\nfrom those used in the\ncalculation of LIBOR and may\nfluctuate differently than,\nand not be representative of,\nLIBOR. In order to compensate\nfor these differences, certain\nof Citi\u2019s financial\ninstruments and commercial\nagreements allow for a\nbenchmark replacement\nadjustment. However, there can\nbe no assurance that any\nbenchmark replacement\nadjustment will be sufficient\nto produce the economic\nequivalent of LIBOR, either at\nthe benchmark replacement date\nor over the life of such\ninstruments and agreements.\n\nFurther, investors,\ncounterparties and other\nmarket participants may not\nconsider the new alternative\nrates to be a suitable\nsubstitute or successor for\nall of the purposes for which\nthese benchmarks have\nhistorically been used\n(including, without\nlimitation, as a\nrepresentation of the\nunsecured short-term funding\ncosts of banks), which may, in\nturn, reduce their market\nacceptance. Any failure of the\nalternative rates to gain\nbroad market acceptance could\nadversely affect market demand\nfor Citi\u2019s products or\nsecurities linked to such\nalternative rates and thus\nmarket prices of such\ninstruments. As part of its\ntransition, Citi is relying or\nhas relied on guidance\nprovided by the accounting\nstandard setters related to\nthe transition away from\nLIBOR. In the event that such\nguidance is insufficient or\notherwise unable to be\nimplemented as intended, LIBOR\ntransition could\n\ndisrupt Citi\u2019s hedge\naccounting relationships\nand/or lead\n\nto increased costs in\nconnection with determining\nwhether contract amendments\nresult in a modification or an\nextinguishment from an\naccounting perspective.\nChanges in observability of\nthe alternative reference\nrates could impact the fair\nvalue hierarchy classification\nof financial instruments and\ncontracts.\n\nMoreover, the LIBOR transition\npresents challenges related to\ncontractual mechanics of\nexisting financial instruments\nand contracts that reference\nsuch benchmarks that mature\nafter discontinuance of the\nrelevant benchmark. Certain of\nthese legacy instruments and\ncontracts do not provide for\nfallbacks to alternative\nreference rates, which makes\nit unclear what the applicable\nfuture replacement benchmark\nrates and associated payments\nmight be after the current\nbenchmark\u2019s cessation. Citi\nmay not be able to amend\ncertain instruments and\ncontracts due to an inability\nto obtain sufficient levels of\nconsent from counterparties or\nsecurity holders. Although\nthis will depend on the\nprecise contractual terms of\nthe instrument, such consent\nrequirements are often\nconditions of securities, such\nas floating rate notes.\n\nEven if the instruments and\ncontracts provide for a\ntransition to an alternative\nreference rate, the new rate\nmay, particularly in times of\nfinancial stress,\nsignificantly differ from the\nprior rates. As a result, Citi\nmay need to consider\nproactively addressing any\ncontractual uncertainties or\nrate differences in such\ninstruments and contracts,\nwhich would likely be both\ntime consuming and costly, and\nmay not ultimately be\nsuccessful. While statutory\nsolutions have been enacted in\ncertain jurisdictions to\naddress these contractual\nconcerns (for example, the\nState of New York and the EU),\nthe availability and\neffectiveness of these\nstatutory mechanisms to cover\nall impacted financial\ninstruments and products to\nwhich Citi is a party is\nuncertain.\n                               58                               \nIn addition, the transition\naway from and discontinuance\nof LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates have subjected financial\ninstitutions, including Citi,\nto heightened scrutiny from\nregulators. Failure to\nsuccessfully transition away\nfrom LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates could result in adverse\nregulatory actions, disputes,\nincluding potential litigation\ninvolving holders of\noutstanding products and\ncontracts that reference\nLIBOR, and other benchmark\nrates and reputational harm to\nCiti. Citi may also need to\nfurther invest in and develop\ninternal systems and\ninfrastructure to transition\nto alternative benchmark rates\nto manage its businesses and\nsupport its clients.\n                               59                               \n                                                                \n  SUSTAINABILITY AND OTHER ESG MATTERS                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Introduction                                                  \n                                                                \nCiti has progressively\ndeveloped its understanding of\nenvironmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) issues for\nmore than 20 years and has a\ndemonstrated record of ESG\nprogress, including\nparticipating in the creation\nand adoption of ESG-related\nprinciples and standards. This\nsection summarizes some of\nCiti\u2019s key ESG initiatives,\nincluding its Sustainable\nProgress Strategy and net zero\nand Action for Racial Equity\ncommitments.\n\nIn January 2022, Citi\npublished its 2021 Task Force\non Climate-Related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) Report to\nprovide its stakeholders with\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\ncontinued progress to address\nclimate risk and to fulfill\nits commitment to publish an\ninitial net zero plan within\none year of announcing the net\nzero commitment. This\nrepresents Citi\u2019s fourth TCFD\nReport.\n\nFor information regarding\nCiti\u2019s management of climate\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Climate Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  ESG and Climate-Related Governance                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  ESG Governance                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors\n(Board) provides oversight of\nCiti\u2019s management activities\nto ensure responsible business\npractices (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Risk Governance\u201d\nbelow). For example, the\nNomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee of\nthe Board oversees many of\nCiti\u2019s ESG activities,\nincluding reviewing Citi\u2019s\npolicies and programs for\nenvironmental and social\nsustainability, climate\nchange, human rights,\ndiversity and other ESG\nissues, as well as advising on\nengagement with external\nstakeholders.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee\nof the Board provides\noversight of Citi\u2019s\nIndependent Risk Management\nfunction and reviews Citi\u2019s\nrisk policies and frameworks,\nincluding receiving climate\nrisk-related updates.\n\nIn 2021, Citi formed a Global\nESG Council consisting of\nsenior members of its\nmanagement in order to provide\nenhanced oversight of Citi\u2019s\nESG goals and activities. In\naddition, a number of teams\nand senior managers contribute\nto the oversight of different\nareas such as sustainability;\ncommunity investing; talent\nand diversity; ethics and\nbusiness practices; and\nremuneration.\n                                                                \n  Climate Change Governance                                     \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s oversight of climate\nrisk has continued to evolve\nwith its expanding climate\ncommitments. In 2021, Citi\nestablished its ESG Council,\nexpanded its Climate Risk team\nand enhanced its climate risk\nand net zero-related\ngovernance through creation of\na Net Zero Task Force. The\nTask Force, led by Citi\u2019s\nChief Sustainability Officer\nand including leaders from\nvarious business units, was\nestablished to support the\ndevelopment and launch of\nCiti\u2019s net zero plan.\n                                                                \n  Key ESG Initiatives                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Sustainable Progress Strategy                                 \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Sustainable Progress\nStrategy is summarized in its\nEnvironmental and Social\nPolicy Framework. The three\npillars of the strategy each\nhave climate-related elements\nand serve as the foundation\nfor Citi\u2019s climate\ncommitments.\n\n\u2022 The first pillar, \u201cLow-\nCarbon Transition,\u201d focuses on\nfinancing and facilitating\nlow-carbon solutions and\nsupporting Citi\u2019s clients in\ntheir decarbonization and\ntransition strategies.\n\n\u2022 The second pillar, \u201cClimate\nRisk,\u201d focuses on Citi\u2019s\nefforts to measure, manage and\nreduce the climate risk and\nimpact of its client\nportfolio. Areas of activity\ninclude, portfolio analysis\nand stakeholder engagement as\nwell as enhancing TCFD\nimplementation and disclosure.\n\n\u2022 The third pillar,\n\u201cSustainable Operations,\u201d\nfocuses on Citi\u2019s efforts to\nreduce the environmental\nfootprint of its facilities\nand strengthen its\nsustainability culture. This\nincludes minimizing the impact\nof its global operations\nthrough operational footprint\ngoals and further integrates\nsustainable practices across\nall countries in which Citi\noperates.\n                                                                \n  Net Zero Emissions by 2050                                    \n                                                                \nIn March 2021, Citi announced\nits commitment to achieving\nnet zero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions associated with its\nfinancing by 2050, and net\nzero GHG emissions for its\noperations by 2030; both are\nsignificant targets given the\nsize and breadth of Citi\u2019s\nlending portfolios and\nbusinesses. Citi made this\ncommitment as part of its\nongoing work to reduce its\nclimate impact and help\naddress the challenges that\nclimate change poses to the\nglobal economy and broader\nsociety. Citi\u2019s net zero\ncommitment demonstrates how\nidentifying, assessing and\nmanaging climate-related risks\nand opportunities remains a\ntop business priority for\nCiti.\n\nWhile many financial\ninstitutions, including Citi,\nface increasing public\npressure to divest from\ncarbon-intensive sectors, Citi\nbelieves it has an important\nrole to play in advising and\nfinancing the transition to\nnet zero, and it plans to work\nclosely with clients in this\neffort. Citi recognizes that\nlarge-scale, rapid divestment\ncould result in an abrupt and\ndisorderly transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, creating\nboth economic and social\nupheaval on a global scale.\nCiti believes that an orderly,\nresponsible and equitable\ntransition, which accounts for\nthe immediate economic needs\nof communities, workers,\nenvironmental justice and\nbroader economic development\nconcerns, is essential for the\nretention of political and\nsocial support to move to a\nlow-carbon economy.\n\nCiti\u2019s 2021 TCFD Report\ndiscusses its initial 2050 net\nzero plan, including 2030\nemissions targets for its\nEnergy and Power loan\nportfolios that were developed\nin line with the Net Zero\nBanking Alliance Guidelines\nfor Climate Target Setting for\nBanks.

These initiatives\ninclude the Partnership for\nCarbon Accounting Financials,\nthe Net Zero Banking Alliance\nand the Glasgow Financial\nAlliance for Net Zero.\n                                                                \n  Action for Racial Equity                                      \n                                                                \nEffectively responding to the\nneeds of communities of color\nin the U.S. represents a\nstrategic imperative for the\nprivate sector. A wide range\nof data and studies have found\nthat many major gaps in\neconomic opportunity,\neducation, income, housing and\nwealth run along racial lines,\nparticularly between Black and\nwhite households. These gaps\nhave not only had implications\nfor Black Americans and other\npeople of color but the\nbroader economy as well.\n\nAccordingly, in September\n2020, Citi and the Citi\nFoundation announced Action\nfor Racial Equity to help\nprovide greater access to\nbanking and credit in\ncommunities of color, increase\ninvestment in Black-owned\nbusinesses, expand affordable\nhousing and homeownership\namong Black Americans and\nadvance anti-racist practices\nwithin Citi and across the\nfinancial services industry.\nAs part of Action for Racial\nEquity, Citi and the Citi\nFoundation have invested more\nthan $1 billion in strategic\ninitiatives to help close the\nracial wealth gap and increase\neconomic mobility in the U.S.\nAction for Racial Equity\nbuilds on Citi\u2019s longstanding\nfocus on advancing financial\ninclusion and economic\nopportunity for communities of\ncolor in the U.S. and\naccelerates its efforts in a\ntime of increased calls for\nracial equity and shifting\npopulation demographics in a\nchanging economy.\n\nIn line with Citi\u2019s continued\ncommitment to expand access to\nbanking products and services\nthat can help advance economic\nprogress\u2014especially for\nunderbanked and unbanked\ncommunities\u2014on February 24,\n2022, Citi announced plans to\neliminate overdraft fees,\nreturned item fees and\noverdraft protection fees by\nmid 2022. In addition to\neliminating these fees, Citi\nwill continue to offer a\nrobust suite of free overdraft\nprotection services for its\nconsumers.

Citigroup\u2019s Board\nof Directors (the Board)\nprovides strategic oversight\nand direction to management\nregarding workforce policies\nand includes many members with\nexperience in overseeing\nworkforce issues.\n\nIn addition, the Board\u2019s\nPersonnel and Compensation\nCommittee regularly reviews\nmanagement\u2019s achievements\nagainst human capital\nmanagement goals, such as\naddressing representation of\nwomen and U.S. minorities in\nassistant vice president (AVP)\nto managing director (MD)\nlevels, as well as talent\nrecruitment and development\ninitiatives.\n\nThe Board works with the\nNomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee to\nevaluate potential successors\nto the Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO). With respect to regular\nsuccession of the CEO and\nsenior management, Citi\u2019s\nBoard evaluates internal, and,\nwhen appropriate, external\ncandidates. To find external\ncandidates, Citi seeks input\nfrom members of the Board,\nsenior management and\nrecruiting firms. To develop\ninternal candidates, Citi\nengages in a number of\npractices, formal and\ninformal, designed to\nfamiliarize the Board with\nCiti\u2019s talent pool. The formal\nprocess involves an annual\ntalent review conducted by\nsenior management at which the\nBoard studies the most\npromising members of senior\nmanagement. The Board learns\nabout each person\u2019s\nexperience, skills, areas of\nexpertise, accomplishments,\ngoals and risk and control\nassessments.

In addition,\nover the past several years,\nCiti has increased efforts to\ndiversify its workforce,\nincluding, among other things,\ntaking actions with respect to\npay equity, representation\ngoals and use of diverse\nslates in recruiting.\n\nPay Equity\n\nCiti has focused on measuring\nand addressing pay equity\nwithin the organization:\n\n\u2022 In 2018, Citi was the first\nmajor U.S. financial\ninstitution to publicly\nrelease the results of a pay\nequity review comparing its\ncompensation of women to men\nand U.S. minorities to U.S.\nnon-minorities. Since 2018,\nCiti has continued to be\ntransparent about pay equity,\nincluding disclosing its\nunadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap\nfor both women and U.S.\nminorities.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2021 pay equity\nreview determined that, on an\nadjusted basis, women globally\nare paid on average more than\n99% of what men are paid at\nCiti. In addition, the review\ndetermined there was no\nstatistically significant\ndifference in adjusted\ncompensation between U.S.\nminorities and non-minorities.\nFollowing the review,\n                               62                               \nappropriate pay adjustments\nwere made as part of Citi\u2019s\n2021 compensation cycle.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2021 raw gap analysis\nshowed that the median pay for\nwomen globally is 74% of the\nmedian for men, similar to\n2020, and up from 73% in 2019\nand 71% in 2018. The median\npay for U.S. minorities is\nmore than 96% of the median\nfor non-minorities, which is\nup from just under 94% in\n2020, 94% in 2019 and 93% in\n2018.\n                                                                \n  Representation Goals                                          \n                                                                \nIncreasing the number of women\nglobally and U.S. Black\nemployees into senior AVP to\nMD levels will position Citi\nto further close the raw pay\ngap and increase the diversity\nof the Company. At the AVP to\nMD levels, Citi established\nrepresentation goals of 40%\nfor women globally and 8% for\nU.S. Black employees by the\nend of 2021. As of December\n31, 2021, Citi exceeded its\ngoals for AVP to MD levels for\nwomen globally (at 40.6%) and\nU.S. Black employees (at\n8.1%).\n\nCiti is the first major Wall\nStreet bank to participate in\nManagement Leadership for\nTomorrow\u2019s Black Equity at\nWork Certification, to help\nmeasure internal progress\ntoward Black equity in the\nworkplace.\n\nIn addition, consistent with\nits ongoing support of\nmeasurement and transparency,\nCiti will conduct a third-\nparty racial equity audit to\nhelp assess the true impact of\nCiti\u2019s Action for Racial\nEquity initiatives (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cSustainability and Other ESG\nMatters\u2014Action for Racial\nEquity\u201d above).\n                                                                \n  Diverse Slates in Recruitment                                 \n                                                                \nIn 2021, Citi expanded the use\nof diverse slates in its\nrecruiting efforts to have at\nleast two women or U.S.\nminorities interview for\nU.S.-based roles and at least\ntwo women interview for global\nhire roles at the AVP to MD\nlevels.\n\nSince implementation, Citi has\nincreased the share of diverse\ncandidates on slates by 26%\nand more than doubled the\ntotal number of diverse slates\nbetween March and December\n2021. Candidate slates were as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 74.4% of roles included a\ndiverse slate with at least\ntwo women globally and/or U.S.\nunderrepresented minorities\nfor U.S. hires; and\n\n\u2022 92.2% of roles included a\ndiverse slate with at least\none woman globally and/or U.S.\nunderrepresented minority for\nU.S. hires compared to 86% in\n2020.\n\nIn 2021, women representation\nin Citi\u2019s full-time global\ncampus programs surpassed its\ngoal of 50%, increasing to 51%\nfrom 49% in 2020. In addition,\nBlack and Hispanic/Latino\nrepresentation within Citi\u2019s\nfull-time U.S. campus programs\nincreased to 28% from 24% in\n2020.\n                                                                \n  Workforce Development                                         \n                                                                \nCiti highly values a workplace\nenvironment where colleagues\ncan bring their authentic\nselves to work and where\ndiverse perspectives and ideas\nare embraced. Citi encourages\ncareer growth and development\nby offering broad and diverse\nopportunities to colleagues.\nHighlights of these\nopportunities include the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Citi provides a range of\ninternal development and\nrotational programs to\ncolleagues at all levels,\nincluding various training\nprograms and events to assist\nhigh-performing colleagues in\nbuilding the skills needed to\ntransition to manager and\nsupervisory roles.\n\n\u2022 Citi has a focus on internal\ntalent development and aims to\nprovide colleagues with career\ngrowth opportunities, with 37%\nof open positions filled\ninternally in 2021. These\nopportunities are particularly\nimportant as Citi focuses on\nproviding career paths for its\ninternal talent base as part\nof its efforts to increase\norganic growth and promotions\nwithin the organization.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, a diverse\ngroup of human resources and\nbusiness stakeholders\ncollaborated to provide input\non the current state and\ntarget future state for\npromotions at Citi. Their\nanalysis resulted in the\nidentification of\nopportunities for improvement\nto create greater transparency\nand alignment of the promotion\nprocess across Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, functions and\nregions.\n                                                                \n  Wellness                                                      \n                                                                \nDuring the past two years, the\npandemic\u2019s impact has been\nsubstantial on the mental and\nphysical health of Citi\ncolleagues and their families.\nAs the Company transforms and\nthe future of work evolves,\ncolleague wellness is a\ncentral component of Citi\u2019s\nfocus. Coming out of the\npandemic, Citi has announced\nthree working models:\ncolleagues will be designated\nas hybrid, resident or remote,\nbased on job-specific\nrequirements.\n\nAs colleagues pivoted to\nremote work during their\nrespective country lockdowns,\nCiti\u2019s health plans also\nexpanded to keep colleagues at\nhome and safe. In the U.S.,\nCiti offered free virtual care\nvisits, home delivery of\nprescriptions, enhanced\nbereavement leave and no-cost\nCOVID testing.\n\nIn addition to providing\naccess to COVID vaccinations,\nwhich included several onsite\nlocations in Asia and the\nU.S., Citi organized drive-\nthrough flu vaccination\nprograms in the U.S. for\nthousands of colleagues and\ntheir family members. All\ncolleagues globally were\nprovided time off for\nvaccinations and boosters and\nto recover from any side\neffects, if needed.\n\nTo support the ongoing health\nof its workforce, on October\n28, 2021 Citi announced a\nCOVID-19 vaccination policy\nrequiring all U.S. colleagues\nand new hires to be fully\nvaccinated or receive an\napproved accommodation or\nstate-permitted exemption, as\na condition of employment. As\nof the January 14, 2022\ndeadline, over 99% of U.S.\ncolleagues were in compliance\nwith the vaccine policy.\n                               63                               \nCiti also took actions to\nsupport the emotional well-\nbeing of its colleagues. Citi\nsignificantly enhanced free\nmental well-being programs in\nour largest region by doubling\nthe number of free counseling\nsessions for colleagues and\ntheir family members and\nadding real-time text, video\nand message-based counseling.\nCiti also debuted a new online\ntool so that all colleagues\naround the globe could easily\nfind their local Employee\nAssistance programs and\nresources. Citi also expanded\nlive, town hall-style mental\nwell-being programming to\ninclude targeted events with\nsubject matter experts aimed\nat parents, caregivers and\nother at-risk groups.\n\nCiti\u2019s wellness vision is not\nsimply a reaction to its\nexternal environment. It has\nconsistently been about\nnurturing colleagues and their\nfamilies, however their\nfamilies are grown. Citi\ncontinues to broaden gender\naffirmation medical coverage\nand incorporate it in its\nbasic medical plan coverage\naround the world. Citi also\nenhanced its fertility\ncoverage and support. In North\nAmerica, Citi\u2019s new Adoption\nand Surrogacy Assistance\nProgram provides reimbursement\nto help with certain expenses\nin the adoption of a child or\nsurrogacy parenting\narrangement.\n\nIn early 2020, Citi expanded\nits Paid Parental Leave Policy\nto include Citi colleagues\naround the world. At a\nminimum, all Citi colleagues\nare eligible for 16 weeks of\npaid pregnancy leave or four\nweeks of paid parental bonding\nleave. Colleagues working in\ncountries that require leave\npolicies above the global\nminimum continue to maintain\neven longer periods of paid\ntime off.\n\nFor information about Citi\u2019s\nreliance on a highly qualified\nand motivated workforce, see \u201c\nRisk Factors\u201d above.

                                                   \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nFor Citi, effective risk\nmanagement is of primary\nimportance to its overall\noperations. Accordingly,\nCiti\u2019s risk management process\nhas been designed to monitor,\nevaluate and manage the\nprincipal risks it assumes in\nconducting its activities.\nSpecifically, the activities\nthat Citi engages in, and the\nrisks those activities\ngenerate, must be consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition and the key\nprinciples that guide it, as\nwell as Citi's risk appetite.\nAs discussed above, Citi is\ncontinuing its efforts to\ncomply with the FRB and OCC\nconsent orders, relating\nprincipally to various aspects\nof risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance, and\ninternal controls (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance\nRisks\u201d above).\n\nRisk management must be built\non a foundation of ethical\nculture. Under Citi\u2019s Mission\nand Value Proposition, which\nwas developed by its senior\nleadership and distributed\nthroughout the Company, Citi\nstrives to serve its clients\nas a trusted partner by\nresponsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable\ngrowth and economic progress\nwhile earning and maintaining\nthe public\u2019s trust by\nconstantly adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. As\nsuch, Citi asks all colleagues\nto ensure that their decisions\npass three tests: they are in\nCiti\u2019s clients\u2019 interests,\ncreate economic value and are\nalways systemically\nresponsible. In addition, Citi\nevaluates colleagues\u2019\nperformance against behavioral\nexpectations set out in Citi\u2019s\nLeadership Principles, which\nwere designed in part to\neffectuate Citi\u2019s Mission and\nValue Proposition. Other\nculture-related efforts in\nconnection with conduct risk,\nethics and leadership,\nescalation and treating\ncustomers fairly help Citi to\nexecute its Mission and Value\nProposition.\n\nCiti has established an\nEnterprise Risk Management\n(ERM) Framework to ensure that\nall of Citi\u2019s risks are\nmanaged appropriately and\nconsistently across Citi and\nat an aggregate, enterprise-\nwide level. The ERM Framework\ndetails the principles used to\nsupport effective enterprise-\nwide risk management across\nthe end-to-end risk management\nlifecycle. The ERM Framework\nalso provides clarity on the\nexpected activities in\nrelation to risk management of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors (the Board), Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team (See\n\u201cRisk Governance\u2014Executive\nManagement Team\u201d below) and\nemployees across the lines of\ndefense. The underlying\npillars of the framework\nencompass:\n\n\u2022 Culture \u2014the core principles\nand behaviors that underpin a\nstrong culture of risk\nawareness, in line with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition,\nand Leadership Principles;\n\n\u2022 Governance \u2014the committee\nstructure and reporting\narrangements that support the\nappropriate oversight of risk\nmanagement activities at the\nBoard and Executive Management\nTeam levels;\n\n\u2022 Risk Management \u2014the end-to-\nend risk management cycle\nincluding the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting of\nall risks including emerging,\ngrowing, idiosyncratic or\notherwise material risks, and\naggregated to an enterprise-\nwide level; and\n\n\u2022 Enterprise Programs \u2014the key\nrisk management programs\nperformed across the risk\nmanagement lifecycle for all\nrisk categories; these\nprograms also outline the\nspecific roles played by each\nof the lines of defense in\nthese processes.\n\nEach of these pillars is\nunderpinned by Supporting\nCapabilities, which are the\ninfrastructure, people,\ntechnology and data, and\nmodelling and analytical\ncapabilities that are in place\nto enable the execution of the\nERM Framework.\n\nCiti\u2019s approach to risk\nmanagement requires that its\nrisk-taking be consistent with\nits risk appetite. Risk\nappetite is the aggregate type\nand level of risk Citi is\nwilling to take in order to\nmeet its strategic objectives\nand business plan. Citi\u2019s Risk\nAppetite Framework sets\nboundaries for risk-taking and\nconsists of a set of risk\nappetite statements as well as\nthe governance processes\nthrough which the risk\nappetite is established,\ncommunicated, cascaded and\nmonitored.\n\nCiti\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized and summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality (or\ndowngrade risk) or failure of\na borrower, counterparty,\nthird party or issuer to honor\nits financial or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat Citi will not be able to\nefficiently meet both expected\nand unexpected current and\nfuture cash flow and\ncollateral needs without\nadversely affecting either\ndaily operations or financial\nconditions of Citi.\n\n\u2022 Market risk ( Trading and\nNon-Trading ): Market risk of\ntrading portfolios is the risk\nof loss arising from changes\nin the value of Citi\u2019s assets\nand liabilities resulting from\nchanges in market variables,\nsuch as equity and commodity\nprices or credit spreads.\nMarket risk of non-trading\nportfolios is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from movements in\ninterest rates and resulting\nfrom repricing risk, basis\nrisk, yield curve risk and\noptions risk.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems,\nor from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from the failure of\nCiti to comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards and contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nCiti\u2019s business, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation risks\n(see below).\n\n\u2022 Compliance risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition and\nresilience arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or\nregulations, or from non-\nconformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies\nand procedures or ethical\nstandards.\n\n\u2022 Reputation risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience arising from\nnegative public opinion.\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk\nof a sustained impact (not\nepisodic impact) to Citi\u2019s\ncore strategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization, or capital,\narising from the external\nfactors\n                               66                               \naffecting the Company\u2019s\noperating environment; as well\nas the risks associated with\ndefining the strategy and\nexecuting the strategy, which\nare identified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense\nmodel as a key component of\nits ERM Framework to manage\nits risks. The lines of\ndefense model brings together\nrisk-taking, risk oversight\nand risk assurance under one\numbrella and provides an\navenue for risk accountability\nof first line of defense, a\nconstruct for effective\nchallenge by the second line\nof defense (Independent Risk\nManagement and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management),\nand empowers independent risk\nassurance by the third line of\ndefense (Internal Audit). In\naddition, Citi has enterprise\nsupport functions that support\nsafety and soundness across\nCiti. Each of the lines of\ndefense and enterprise support\nfunctions, along with the\nBoard, are empowered to\nperform relevant risk\nmanagement processes and\nresponsibilities in order to\nmanage Citi\u2019s risks in a\nconsistent and effective\nmanner.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Front\nLine Units and Front Line Unit\nActivities\n\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\nowns the risks inherent in or\narising from their business\nand is responsible for\nidentifying, measuring,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting those risks\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nstrategy, Mission and Value\nProposition, Leadership\nPrinciples and risk appetite.\n\nFront line units are\nresponsible and held\naccountable for managing the\nrisks associated with their\nactivities within the\nboundaries set by independent\nrisk management. They are also\nresponsible for designing and\nimplementing effective\ninternal controls and\nmaintaining processes for\nmanaging their risk profile,\nincluding through risk\nmitigation, so that it remains\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nestablished risk appetite.\n\nFront line unit activities are\nconsidered part of the first\nline of defense and are\nsubject to the oversight and\nchallenge of independent risk\nmanagement.\n                  The first line of defense is                  \n                  composed of Citi\u2019s Business                   \nManagement, Regional and\nCountry Management, certain\nCorporate Functions\n(Enterprise Operations and\nTechnology, Chief\nAdministrative Office, Global\nPublic Affairs, Office of the\nCitibank Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Finance), as\nwell as other front line unit\nactivities. Front line units\nmay also include enterprise\nsupport units and\nactivities\u2014see \u201cEnterprise\nSupport Functions\u201d below.\n\nSecond Line of Defense:\nIndependent Risk Management\nIndependent risk management\nunits are independent of front\nline units. They are\nresponsible for overseeing the\nrisk-taking activities of the\nfirst line of defense and\nchallenging the first line of\ndefense in the execution of\ntheir risk management\nresponsibilities. They are\nalso responsible for\nindependently identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\naggregate risks and for\nsetting standards for the\nmanagement and oversight of\nrisk. Independent risk\nmanagement is comprised of\nIndependent Risk Management\n(IRM) and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\n(ICRM) and are led by chief\nrisk executives (i.e., Chief\nRisk Officer (CRO)\n\nand Chief Compliance Officer\n(CCO)) who have unrestricted\naccess to the Citigroup Board\nof Directors and its Risk\nManagement Committee to\nfacilitate the ability to\nexecute their specific\nresponsibilities pertaining to\nescalation to the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Independent Risk Management                                   \n                                                                \nThe IRM organization sets risk\nand control standards for the\nfirst line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees\naggregate credit, market\n(trading and non-trading),\nliquidity, strategic,\noperational and reputation\nrisks across Citi, including\nrisks that span categories,\nsuch as concentration risk,\ncountry risk and climate risk.\n\nIRM is organized to align to\nrisk categories, legal\nentities/regions and Company-\nwide, cross-risk functions or\nprocesses (i.e., foundational\nareas). There are teams that\nreport to an independent CRO\nfor various risk categories\nand legal entities/regions. In\naddition, there are\nfoundational teams that report\nto Foundational Risk\nManagement heads. The Risk\nCategory, Legal\nEntity/Regional CROs and\nFoundational Risk Management\nHeads report to the Citigroup\nCRO.\n                                                                \n  Independent Compliance Risk Management                        \n                                                                \nThe ICRM organization actively\noversees compliance risk\nacross Citi, sets compliance\nrisk and control standards for\nthe first line of defense to\nmanage compliance risk and\npromotes business conduct and\nactivity that is consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition and the compliance\nrisk appetite. Citi\u2019s\nobjective is to embed an\nenterprise-wide compliance\nrisk management framework and\nculture that identifies,\nmeasures, monitors, controls\nand escalates compliance risk\nacross Citi.\n\nICRM is aligned by product\nline, function and geography\nto provide compliance risk\nmanagement advice and credible\nchallenge on day-to-day\nmatters and strategic\ndecision-making for key\ninitiatives. ICRM also has\nprogram-level Enterprise\nCompliance units responsible\nfor setting standards and\nestablishing priorities for\nprogram-related compliance\nefforts. These Compliance Risk\nManagement heads report\ndirectly to the CCO.\n                                                                \n  Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit                         \n                                                                \nInternal Audit is independent\nof front line units and\nindependent risk management\nunits. The role of Internal\nAudit is to provide\nindependent, objective,\nreliable, valued and timely\nassurance to the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors, its Audit\nCommittee, Citi senior\nmanagement and regulators over\nthe effectiveness of\ngovernance, risk management\nand controls that mitigate\ncurrent and evolving risks and\nenhance the control culture\nwithin Citi.

Credit risk\narises in many of Citigroup\u2019s\nbusiness activities,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 consumer, commercial and\ncorporate lending;\n\n\u2022 capital markets derivative\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 structured finance; and\n\n\u2022 securities financing\ntransactions (repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nand securities loaned and\nborrowed).\n\nCredit risk also arises from\nclearing and settlement\nactivities, when Citi\ntransfers an asset in advance\nof receiving its counter-value\nor advances funds to settle a\ntransaction on behalf of a\nclient. Concentration risk,\nwithin credit risk, is the\nrisk associated with having\ncredit exposure concentrated\nwithin a specific client,\nindustry, region or other\ncategory.\n\nCredit risk is one of the most\nsignificant risks Citi faces\nas an institution. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Credit Risk\u201d\nabove. As a result, Citi has\nan established framework in\nplace for managing credit risk\nacross all businesses that\nincludes a defined risk\nappetite, credit limits and\ncredit policies. Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk management also includes\nprocesses and policies with\nrespect to problem\nrecognition, including \u201cwatch\nlists,\u201d portfolio reviews,\nstress tests, updated risk\nratings and classification\ntriggers.\n\nWith respect to Citi\u2019s\nclearing and settlement\nactivities, intraday client\nusage of clearing lines is\nmonitored against limits, as\nwell as against usage patterns\nwith settlement activity\nmonitored daily and intraday\nfor select products. To the\nextent that a problem\ndevelops, Citi typically moves\nthe client to a secured\n(collateralized) operating\nmodel. Generally, Citi\u2019s\nintraday clearing and\nsettlement lines are\nuncommitted and cancelable at\nany time.\n\nTo manage concentration of\nrisk within credit risk, Citi\nhas in place a framework\nconsisting of industry limits,\nan\n\nidiosyncratic framework\nconsisting of single name\nconcentrations for each\nbusiness and across Citigroup\nand a specialized framework\nconsisting of product limits.\n\nCredit exposures are generally\nreported in notional terms for\naccrual loans, reflecting the\nvalue at which the loans as\nwell as other off-balance\nsheet commitments are carried\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit exposure arising\nfrom capital markets\nactivities is generally\nexpressed as the current mark-\nto-market, net of margin,\nreflecting the net value owed\nto Citi by a given\ncounterparty.\n\nThe credit risk associated\nwith these credit exposures is\na function of the\nidiosyncratic creditworthiness\nof the obligor, as well as the\nterms and conditions of the\nspecific obligation. Citi\nassesses the credit risk\nassociated with its credit\nexposures on a regular basis\nthrough its Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL) process\n(see \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d below and Notes 1 and\n15 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements), as well\nas through regular stress\ntesting at the company,\nbusiness, geography and\nproduct levels. These stress-\ntesting processes typically\nestimate potential incremental\ncredit costs that would occur\nas a result of either\ndowngrades in the credit\nquality or defaults of the\nobligors or counterparties.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s credit risk management,\nsee Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                               69                               \n                                                                \n  CONSUMER CREDIT                                               \n                                                                \nCiti fulfills a broad spectrum\nof customers\u2019 financial needs\nwith activities spanning\nretail banking, wealth\nmanagement, credit card,\npersonal loan, mortgage and\nsmall business banking through\nNorth America GCB .

Citigroup\u2019s policy is generally to accrue interest on\ncredit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification\nof bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios for North America GCB exclude loans guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agencies since the potential loss\npredominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $185 million ($1.1 billion), $171 million ($0.7\nbillion) and $135 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans\n30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans have the\nsame adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $74\nmillion, $98 million and $72 million at December 31, 2021, 2020\nand 2019, respectively.\n\n(5) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA\ncountries for all periods presented.\n\n(6) During 2021, Citi\u2019s Australia and the Philippines consumer\nbanking businesses were reclassified as HFS, due to Citi\u2019s entry\ninto agreements to sell the businesses.

Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of\ndefault of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given\ndefault of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal\nobligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are\nconsidered investment grade, while those below are considered\nnon-investment grade.\n                               77                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) by facility risk\nrating as a percentage of the\ntotal corporate credit\nportfolio:\n                                                                \n                    Total                                       \n                 exposure                                       \n                 December        September         December     \n                      31,              30,              31,     \n                     2021             2021             2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             51  %            49  %            49  %  \n  BBB                  32               32               31     \n  BB/B                 15               16               17     \n  CCC or                2                3                3     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %           100  %           100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the obligor and\nfacility risk ratings assigned\nto all exposures, Citi may\nclassify exposures in the\ncorporate credit portfolio.\nThese classifications are\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the U.S.\nbanking regulators\u2019 definition\nof criticized exposures, which\nmay categorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful or loss. Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. This includes but\nis not limited to exposures in\nthose sectors significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic\n(including consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\ntransportation). Citi believes\nthe corporate credit portfolio\nto be appropriately rated and\nclassified as of December 31,\n2021. Since the onset of the\npandemic, Citi has taken\naction to adjust internal\nratings and classifications of\nexposures as both the\nmacroeconomic environment and\nobligor-specific factors have\nchanged, particularly where\nadditional stress has been\nseen. As obligor risk ratings\nare downgraded, the\nprobability of default\nincreases. Downgrades of\nobligor risk ratings tend to\nresult in a higher provision\nfor credit losses. In\naddition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

Of the $38.8 billion of purchased credit protection,\n$36.8 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased\ncredit derivatives on individual reference entities. The\nremaining $2.0 billion represents the first loss tranche of\nportfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional\nof $16.1 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first\nloss on the referenced loan portfolios.\n\n(6) Autos total credit exposure includes securitization\nfinancing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended\nmainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto\nmanufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance\ncompanies, of approximately $20.2 billion ($10.3 billion in\nfunded, with more than 99% rated investment grade) at December\n31, 2020.\n\n(7) In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related\nexposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-\nowned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector\n(e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Citi\u2019s total exposure to these energy-\nrelated entities was approximately $7.0 billion, of which\napproximately $3.8 billion consisted of direct outstanding\nfunded loans.\n                               80                               \nExposure to Commercial Real\nEstate As of December 31,\n2021, ICG \u2019s total corporate\ncredit exposure to commercial\nreal estate (CRE) was $66\nbillion, with $44 billion\nconsisting of direct\noutstanding funded loans\n(mainly included in the real\nestate and private bank\ncategories in the above\ntable), or 7% of Citi\u2019s total\noutstanding loans. In\naddition, as of December 31,\n2021, more than 70% of ICG \u2019s\ntotal corporate CRE exposure\nwas to borrowers in the U.S.\nAlso as of December 31, 2021,\napproximately 77% of ICG \u2019s\ntotal corporate CRE exposure\nwas rated investment grade. As\nof December 31, 2021, the ACLL\nwas 0.9% of funded CRE\nexposure, including 2.4% of\nfunded non-investment-grade\nexposure. Of the total CRE\nexposure: \u2022 $20 billion ($12\nbillion of direct outstanding\nfunded loans) relates to\nCommunity Reinvestment Act-\nrelated lending provided\npursuant to Citi\u2019s regulatory\nrequirements to meet the\ncredit needs of borrowers in\nlow and moderate income\nneighborhoods. \u2022 $20 billion\n($16 billion of direct\noutstanding funded loans)\nrelates to exposure secured by\nmortgages on underlying\nproperties or in well-rated\nsecuritization exposures. \u2022\n$15 billion ($5 billion of\ndirect outstanding funded\nloans) relates to unsecured\nloans to large REITs, with\nnearly 74% of the exposure\nrated investment grade. \u2022 $11\nbillion ($11 billion of direct\noutstanding funded loans)\nrelates to CRE exposure in the\nprivate bank, of which 100% is\nsecured by mortgages. In\naddition, 48% of the exposure\nis also full recourse to the\nclient. As of December 31,\n2021, 82% of the exposure was\nrated investment grade.\n\nCredit Risk Mitigation As part\nof its overall risk management\nactivities, Citi uses credit\nderivatives and other risk\nmitigants to hedge portions of\nthe credit risk in its\ncorporate credit portfolio, in\naddition to outright asset\nsales. Citi may enter into\npartial-term hedges as well as\nfull-term hedges. In advance\nof the expiration of partial-\nterm hedges, Citi will\ndetermine, among other\nfactors, the economic\nfeasibility of hedging the\nremaining life of the\ninstrument. The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At December 31, 2021,\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, ICG\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) had economic hedges\non the corporate credit\nportfolio of $39.6 billion,\n$38.1 billion and $38.8\nbillion, respectively. Citi\u2019s\nexpected credit loss model\nused in the calculation of its\nACL does not include the\nfavorable impact of credit\nderivatives and other\nmitigants that are marked to\nmarket. In addition, the\nreported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions. The credit\nprotection was economically\nhedging underlying ICG\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) corporate credit\nportfolio exposures with the\nfollowing risk

                                        \n(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(CECL) . The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology\nrequiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1,\n2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%,\npretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a\n$3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a\ndeferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due\nto longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a\n$0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter\nremaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more\nspecific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 1 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on\nthe impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n\n(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded\nas an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for\ncredit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(4) 2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to\nCiti\u2019s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in\nAustralia and an approximate $90 million reclass related to\nCiti\u2019s agreement to sell its consumer banking business in the\nPhilippines. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during\n2021. 2021 also includes a decrease of approximately $134\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(5) 2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related\nto the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios.\nIn addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(6) 2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of\napproximately $60 million related to FX translation.\n\n(7) 2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In\naddition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(8) 2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In\naddition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(9) December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 exclude $6.1\nbillion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion and $4.4\nbillion, respectively, of loans which are carried at fair value.\n\n(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of\n$68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees.\nThe reserves on these contracts were reclassified out of the ACL\non unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.\n\n(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nand troubled debt restructurings.

Renegotiated Loans\n\nThere is a certain amount of\noverlap among non-accrual\nloans and assets and\nrenegotiated loans. The\nfollowing summary provides a\ngeneral description of each\ncategory.\n\nNon-Accrual Loans and Assets :\n\n\u2022 Corporate and consumer\n(including commercial banking)\nnon-accrual status is based on\nthe determination that payment\nof interest or principal is\ndoubtful.\n\n\u2022 A corporate loan may be\nclassified as non-accrual and\nstill be performing under the\nterms of the loan structure.\nNon-accrual loans may still be\ncurrent on interest payments.\nCiti\u2019s corporate non-accrual\nloans were $1.9 billion, $2.4\nbillion and $3.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021, September\n30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.

Citigroup\u2019s\nprimary liquidity objectives\nare established by entity, and\nin aggregate, across two major\ncategories:\n\n\u2022 Citibank (including Citibank\nEurope plc, Citibank Singapore\nLtd. and Citibank (Hong Kong)\nLtd.); and\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s non-bank and other\nentities, including the parent\nholding company (Citigroup\nInc.), Citi\u2019s primary\nintermediate holding company\n(Citicorp LLC), Citi\u2019s broker-\ndealer subsidiaries (including\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nCitigroup Global Markets\nLimited. and Citigroup Global\nMarkets Japan Inc.) and other\nbank and non-bank subsidiaries\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup (including\nCitibanamex).\n\nAt an aggregate Citigroup\nlevel, Citi\u2019s goal is to\nmaintain sufficient funding in\namount and tenor to fully fund\ncustomer assets and to provide\nan appropriate amount of cash\nand high-quality liquid assets\n(as discussed below), even in\ntimes of stress, in order to\nmeet its payment obligations\nas they come due. The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary funding sources\ninclude (i) corporate and\nconsumer deposits via Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries, including\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank),\n(ii) long-term debt (primarily\nsenior and subordinated debt)\nmainly issued by Citigroup\nInc., as the parent, and\nCitibank, and (iii)\nstockholders\u2019 equity. These\nsources may be supplemented by\nshort-term borrowings,\nprimarily in the form of\nsecured funding transactions.\n\nAs referenced above, Citi\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity\nframework ensures that the\ntenor of these funding sources\nis of sufficient term in\nrelation to the tenor of its\nasset base. The goal of Citi\u2019s\nasset/liability management is\nto ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and tenor\nin the liability structure\nrelative to the liquidity\nprofile of the assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nliabilities will become due\nbefore assets mature or are\n\nmonetized. This excess\nliquidity is held primarily in\nthe form of high-quality\nliquid assets (HQLA), as set\nforth in the table below.\n\nCiti\u2019s liquidity is managed\nvia a centralized treasury\nmodel by Treasury, in\nconjunction with regional and\nin-country treasurers with\noversight provided by\nIndependent Risk Management\nand various Asset & Liability\nCommittees (ALCOs) at the\nCitigroup, region, country and\nbusiness levels. Pursuant to\nthis approach, Citi\u2019s HQLA is\nmanaged with emphasis on\nasset-liability management and\nentity-level liquidity\nadequacy throughout Citi.\n\nCiti\u2019s CRO and Chief Financial\nOfficer co-chair Citigroup\u2019s\nALCO, which includes Citi\u2019s\nTreasurer and other senior\nexecutives. The ALCO sets the\nstrategy of the liquidity\nportfolio and monitors\nportfolio performance (for\nadditional information about\nthe ALCO, see \u201cRisk\nGovernance\u2014Board and Executive\nManagement Committees\u201d above).\nSignificant changes to\nportfolio asset allocations\nare approved by the ALCO. Citi\nalso has other ALCOs, which\nare established at various\norganizational levels to\nensure appropriate oversight\nfor countries, franchise\nbusinesses and regions,\nserving as the primary\ngovernance committees for\nmanaging Citi\u2019s balance sheet\nand liquidity.\n\nAs a supplement to ALCO,\nCiti\u2019s Funding and Liquidity\nRisk Committee (FLRC) is a\nmore focused assembly for\nfunding and liquidity risk\nmatters. The FLRC reviews and\ndiscusses the funding and\nliquidity risk profile of, as\nwell as risk management\npractices for Citigroup and\nCitibank and reports its\nfindings and recommendations\nto each relevant ALCO as\nappropriate.\n                                                                \n  Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nLiquidity stress testing is\nperformed for each of Citi\u2019s\nmajor entities, operating\nsubsidiaries and/or countries.\nStress testing and scenario\nanalyses are intended to\nquantify the potential impact\nof an adverse liquidity event\non the balance sheet and\nliquidity position, and to\nidentify viable funding\nalternatives that can be\nutilized. These scenarios\ninclude assumptions about\nsignificant changes in key\nfunding sources, market\ntriggers (such as credit\nratings), potential uses of\nfunding and macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude expected and stressed\nmarket conditions as well as\nCompany-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are\nperformed to ascertain\npotential mismatches between\nliquidity sources and uses\nover a variety of time\nhorizons and over different\nstressed conditions. To\nmonitor the liquidity of an\nentity, these stress tests and\npotential mismatches are\ncalculated with varying\nfrequencies, with several\ntests performed daily.\n\nGiven the range of potential\nstresses, Citi maintains\ncontingency funding plans on a\nconsolidated basis and for\nindividual entities. These\nplans specify a wide range of\nreadily available actions for\na variety of adverse market\nconditions or idiosyncratic\nstresses.\n                               92                               \n                                                                \n  High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts set forth in\nthe table above are presented\non an average basis. For\nsecurities, the amounts\nrepresent the liquidity value\nthat potentially could be\nrealized and, therefore,\nexclude any securities that\nare encumbered and incorporate\nany haircuts applicable under\nthe U.S. LCR rule. The table\nabove incorporates various\nrestrictions that could limit\nthe transferability of\nliquidity between legal\nentities, including Section\n23A of the Federal Reserve\nAct.\n\n(1) Foreign government debt\nincludes securities issued or\nguaranteed by foreign\nsovereigns, agencies and\nmultilateral development\nbanks. Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Mexico, South Korea,\nIndia and Hong Kong.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLiquidity Coverage ratio\n(LCR), pursuant to the U.S.\nLCR rules. These amounts\ninclude the HQLA needed to\nmeet the minimum requirements\nat these entities and any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are assumed to\nbe transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s HQLA increased\nquarter-over-quarter as of the\nfourth quarter of 2021,\nprimarily reflecting an\nincrease in deposits. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, Citigroup\nhad $961 billion of available\nliquidity resources to support\nclient and business needs,\nincluding end-of-period HQLA\nassets; additional\nunencumbered securities,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup; and\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and Federal\nReserve Bank discount window\nborrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing HQLA by estimated net\noutflows assuming a stressed\n30-day period, with the net\noutflows determined by\nstandardized stress outflow\nand inflow rates prescribed in\nthe LCR rule. The outflows are\npartially offset by\ncontractual inflows from\nassets maturing within 30\ndays. Similar to outflows, the\ninflows are calculated based\non prescribed factors to\nvarious assets categories,\nsuch as retail loans as well\nas unsecured and secured\nwholesale lending. The minimum\nLCR requirement is 100%.

In\ngeneral, a bank\u2019s available\nstable funding includes\nportions of equity, deposits\nand long-term debt, while its\nrequired stable funding will\nbe based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings are\nrequired to be applied to the\nvarious asset and liabilities\nclasses. The ratio of\navailable stable funding to\nrequired stable funding is\nrequired to be greater than\n100%. The final rule became\neffective beginning July 1,\n2021, while public disclosure\nrequirements to report the\nratio will occur on a\nsemiannual basis beginning\nJune 30, 2023. Citi was in\ncompliance with the final rule\nas of December 31, 2021.

As of the fourth\nquarter of 2021, end-of period\nloans declined 1% year-over-\nyear and were largely\nunchanged quarter-over-\nquarter. On an average basis,\nloans were largely unchanged\nboth year-over-year and\nsequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\naverage loans increased 1%\nyear-over-year and were\nlargely unchanged\nsequentially. On this basis,\naverage GCB loans declined 4%\nyear-over-year, primarily\nreflecting the\nreclassification of loans to\nheld-for-sale as a result of\nCiti\u2019s\n\nentry into agreements to sell\nits consumer banking\nbusinesses in Australia and\nthe Philippines. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\naverage ICG loans increased 5%\nyear-over-year. Loans in\ncorporate lending declined 12%\non an average basis,\nreflecting net repayments as\nCiti continued to assist its\nclients in accessing the\ncapital markets, as well as\nlower demand. Private bank\nloans increased 10%, largely\ndriven by increased secured\nlending to high-net-worth\nclients. Markets and\nsecurities services loans\nincreased 29%, reflecting an\nincrease in securitization\nfinancing. TTS loans increased\n15%, reflecting an increase in\ntrade flows and originations.\nAverage Corporate/Other loans\ncontinued to decline (down\n46%), driven by the wind-down\nof legacy assets.

Long-term debt is an\nimportant funding source due\nin part to its multiyear\ncontractual maturity\nstructure. The weighted-\naverage maturity of unsecured\nlong-term debt issued by\nCitigroup and its affiliates\n(including Citibank) with a\nremaining life greater than\none year was approximately 8.6\nyears as of December 31, 2021,\nunchanged from the prior\nquarter and the prior year.\nThe weighted-average maturity\nis calculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of December 31,\n2021, non-bank included $65.9\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. Within bank,\nborrowings under certain U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity\nprograms are also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by branded credit card\nreceivables. As of the fourth\nquarter of 2021, Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\ndecreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by declines\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt at the non-bank entities\nand the bank, as well as\nsecuritizations and FHLB\nborrowings at the bank. The\ndecrease in total long-term\ndebt was partially offset by\nthe issuance of customer-\nrelated debt at the non-bank\nentities. Sequentially, long-\nterm debt outstanding\ndecreased, driven primarily by\ndecreases in unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt at the\nnon-bank entities and\nsecuritizations at the bank,\npartially offset by the\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nAs part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi also has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During 2021,\nCiti redeemed or repurchased\nan aggregate of approximately\n$33.8 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               95                               \n

and Federal Reserve\nBoard to periodically submit a\nplan for Citi\u2019s rapid and\norderly resolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code in the\nevent of material financial\ndistress or failure.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, the\nFederal Reserve Board and FDIC\nissued feedback on the\nresolution plans filed on July\n1, 2019 by the eight U.S.\nGlobal Systemically Important\nBanks, including Citigroup.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and\nFDIC identified one\nshortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies, in Citigroup's\nresolution plan relating to\ngovernance mechanisms. Based\non regulatory changes\neffective December 31, 2019,\nCitigroup's 2021 resolution\nplan submission, which was\nfiled on July 1, 2021 was a\ntargeted resolution plan, only\nincluding a subset of the\ninformation of a full\nresolution plan and additional\ninformation, identified by the\nFederal Reserve Board and FDIC\non July 1, 2020. Citigroup\nwill alternate between\nsubmitting a full resolution\nplan and a targeted resolution\nplan on a biennial cycle. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s resolution plan\nsubmissions, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove. Citigroup\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy is \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2021\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s websites)\nwould remain operational\noutside of any resolution or\ninsolvency proceedings.\nCitigroup\u2019s resolution plan\nhas been designed to minimize\nthe risk of systemic impact to\nthe U.S. and global financial\nsystems, while maximizing the\nvalue of the bankruptcy estate\nfor the benefit of Citigroup\u2019s\ncreditors, including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders.\n\nIn addition, in line with the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s final\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity\n(TLAC) rule, Citigroup\nbelieves it has developed the\nresolution plan so that\nCitigroup\u2019s shareholders and\nunsecured creditors\u2014including\nits unsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC has also indicated\nthat it was developing a\nsingle point of entry strategy\nto implement the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, which provides the FDIC\nwith the ability to resolve a\nfirm when it is determined\nthat bankruptcy would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nU.S.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in\nresponse to feedback received\nfrom the Federal Reserve Board\nand FDIC, Citigroup took the\nfollowing actions:\n\n(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp),\nan existing wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, was\nestablished as an intermediate\nholding company (an IHC) for\ncertain of Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities;\n\n(ii) Citigroup executed an\ninter-affiliate agreement with\nCiticorp, Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities and certain other\naffiliated entities pursuant\nto which Citicorp is required\nto provide liquidity and\ncapital support to Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities in the event\nCitigroup were to enter\nbankruptcy proceedings (Citi\nSupport Agreement);\n\n(iii) pursuant to the Citi\nSupport Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Citigroup made an initial\ncontribution of assets,\nincluding certain high-quality\nliquid assets and inter-\naffiliate loans (Contributable\nAssets), to Citicorp, and\nCiticorp became the business-\nas-usual funding vehicle for\nCitigroup\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities;\n\n\u2022 Citigroup will be obligated\nto continue to transfer\nContributable Assets to\nCiticorp over time, subject to\ncertain amounts retained by\nCitigroup to, among other\nthings, meet Citigroup\u2019s near-\nterm cash needs;\n\n\u2022 in the event of a Citigroup\nbankruptcy, Citigroup will be\nrequired to contribute most of\nits remaining assets to\nCiticorp; and\n\n(iv) the obligations of both\nCitigroup and Citicorp under\nthe Citi Support Agreement, as\nwell as the Contributable\nAssets, are secured pursuant\nto a security agreement.\n\nThe Citi Support Agreement\nprovides two mechanisms,\nbesides Citicorp\u2019s issuing of\ndividends to Citigroup,\npursuant to which Citicorp\nwill be required to transfer\ncash to Citigroup during\nbusiness as usual so that\nCitigroup can fund its debt\nservice as well as other\noperating needs: (i) one or\nmore funding notes issued by\nCiticorp to Citigroup and (ii)\na committed line of credit\nunder which Citicorp may make\nloans to Citigroup.\n                                                                \n  Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)                          \n                                                                \nU.S. GSIBs are required to\nmaintain minimum levels of\nTLAC and eligible LTD, each\nset by reference to the GSIB\u2019s\nconsolidated risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and total\nleverage exposure. The\nintended purpose of the\nrequirements is to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution of U.S.\nGSIBs under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and Title II\nof the Dodd-Frank Act.

Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $191\nbillion as of December 31,\n2021 decreased 3% from the\nprior-year period and 9%\nsequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nsecured funding decreased 1%\nfrom the prior-year period and\n8% sequentially, driven by\nnormal business activity. The\naverage balance for secured\nfunding was approximately $222\nbillion for the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury\n\nsecurities, U.S. agency\nsecurities and foreign\ngovernment debt\n\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market-making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $28 billion as of the\nfourth quarter of 2021\ndecreased 5% year-over-year,\nreflecting a decline in FHLB\nadvances, and 6% sequentially,\nprimarily driven by a decline\nin structured notes (see Note\n17 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for\nfurther information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 outstanding short-\nterm borrowings).\n                               98                               \n                                                                \n  CREDIT RATINGS                                                \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, funding capacity,\nability to access capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds, the cost of these funds\nand its ability to maintain\ncertain deposits are partially\ndependent on its credit\nratings.\n\nThe table below shows the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of December 31,\n2021.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.8 billion,\ncompared to $1.1 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2021. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.6\nbillion, compared to $0.5\nbillion as of September 30,\n2021. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured financing\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\naffected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31,\n2021, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.4 billion, compared to $1.6\nbillion as of September 30,\n2021 (see also Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). As detailed under\n\u201cHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               99                               \n                                                                \n  Citibank\u2014Additional Potential Impacts                         \n                                                                \nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of December 31,\n2021, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximate ly\n$9.0 billi on to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, compared to $10.0\nbillion as of September 30,\n2021 (fo r additional\ninformation, see Note 21 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                              100                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  OVERVIEW                                                      \n                                                                \nMarket risk is the potential\nfor losses arising from\nchanges in the value of Citi\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nresulting from changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices,\ncommodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities. Market\nrisk emanates from both Citi\u2019s\ntrading and non-trading\nportfolios. For additional\ninformation on market risk and\nmarket risk management, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d above.\n\nEach business is required to\nestablish, with approval from\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\na market risk limit framework\nfor identified risk factors\nthat clearly defines approved\nrisk profiles and is within\nthe parameters of Citi\u2019s\noverall risk appetite. These\nlimits are monitored by the\nRisk organization, including\nvarious regional, legal entity\nand business Risk Management\ncommittees, Citi\u2019s country and\nbusiness Asset & Liability\nCommittees and the Citigroup\nRisk Management and Asset &\nLiability Committees. In all\ncases, the businesses are\nultimately responsible for the\nmarket risks taken and for\nremaining within their defined\nlimits.\n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS                         \n                                                                \nMarket risk from non-trading\nportfolios stems from the\npotential impact of changes in\ninterest rates and foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income, and on Citi\u2019s\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) from its debt\nsecurities portfolios. Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Net Interest Income at Risk                                   \n                                                                \nNet interest income, for\ninterest rate exposure\npurposes, is the difference\nbetween the yield earned on\nthe non-trading portfolio\nassets (including customer\nloans) and the rate paid on\nthe liabilities (including\ncustomer deposits or company\nborrowings). Net interest\nincome is affected by changes\nin the level of interest\nrates, as well as the amounts\nand mix of assets and\nliabilities, and the timing of\ncontractual and assumed\nrepricing of assets and\nliabilities to reflect market\nrates.\n\nCiti\u2019s principal measure of\nrisk to net interest income is\ninterest rate exposure (IRE).\nIRE measures the change in\nexpected net interest income\nin each currency resulting\nsolely from unanticipated\nchanges in forward interest\nrates.\n\nCiti\u2019s estimated IRE\nincorporates various\nassumptions including\nprepayment rates on loans,\ncustomer behavior and the\nimpact of pricing decisions.\nFor example, in rising\ninterest rate scenarios,\nportions of the deposit\nportfolio may be assumed to\nexperience rate increases that\nare less than the change in\nmarket interest rates. In\ndeclining interest rate\nscenarios, it is assumed that\nmortgage portfolios experience\nhigher prepayment rates.\nCiti\u2019s estimated IRE below\nassumes that its businesses\nand/or Citi Treasury make no\nadditional changes in balances\nor positioning in response to\nthe unanticipated rate\nchanges.\n\nCiti is planning to transition\nthe sensitivity analysis for\nits IRE (see the current IRE\nsensitivity impacts below),\nemploying enhanced\nmethodologies and changes to\ncertain\n\nassumptions. The changes\ninclude, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet (being\nmore static), coupled with\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\nto IRE, mainly accrual\npositions in ICG \u2019s Markets\nbusinesses. These changes are\nplanned for 2022, and will\nresult in a higher impact to\nCiti\u2019s NII and AOCI and a\nbetter reflection of the\nnature of the portfolios.\n\nIn order to manage changes in\ninterest rates effectively,\nCiti may modify pricing on new\ncustomer loans and deposits,\npurchase fixed-rate\nsecurities, issue debt that is\neither fixed or floating or\nenter into derivative\ntransactions that have the\nopposite risk exposures. Citi\nregularly assesses the\nviability of these and other\nstrategies to reduce its\ninterest rate risks and\nimplements such strategies\nwhen it believes those actions\nare prudent.\n\nCiti manages interest rate\nrisk as a consolidated\nCompany-wide position. Citi\u2019s\nclient-facing businesses\ncreate interest rate-sensitive\npositions, including loans and\ndeposits, as part of their\nongoing activities. Citi\nTreasury aggregates these risk\npositions and manages them\ncentrally. Operating within\nestablished limits, Citi\nTreasury makes positioning\ndecisions and uses tools, such\nas Citi\u2019s investment\nsecurities portfolio, company-\nissued debt and interest rate\nderivatives, to target the\ndesired risk profile. Changes\nin Citi\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition reflect the\naccumulated changes in all\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, with potentially\nlarge and offsetting impacts,\nas well as in Citi Treasury\u2019s\npositioning decisions.\n\nCitigroup employs additional\nmeasurements, including stress\ntesting the impact of non-\nlinear interest rate movements\non the value of the balance\nsheet, and the analysis of\nportfolio duration and\nvolatility, particularly as\nthey relate to mortgage loans\nand mortgage-backed securities\nand the potential impact of\nthe change in the spread\nbetween different market\nindices.\n\nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\n\non AOCI\n\nCiti also measures the\npotential impacts of changes\nin interest rates on the value\nof its AOCI , which can in\nturn impact Citi\u2019s common\nequity and tangible common\nequity. This will impact\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nand other regulatory capital\nratios. Citi\u2019s goal is to\nbenefit from an increase in\nthe market level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\nimpact of changes in AOCI on\nits regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential changes in AOCI (and\nthe corresponding impact on\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio) relative to\nCiti\u2019s capital generation\ncapacity.\n                              101                               \nThe following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an\nunanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point (bps)\nincrease in interest rates:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                                                            \n  dollars,                                                      \n  except                                                        \n  as                                                            \n  otherwi\u2026        Dec. 31,        Sept. 30,        Dec. 31,     \n  noted               2021             2021            2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  annuali\u2026                                                      \n  impact                                                        \n  to net                                                        \n  interest                                                      \n  income                                                        \n  U.S.        $        563     $        151     $       373     \n  dollar(\u2026                                                      \n  All                                                           \n  other                612              586             683     \n  currenc\u2026                                                      \n  Total       $      1,175     $        737     $     1,056     \n  As a                                                          \n  percent\u2026                                                      \n  of                  0.05  %          0.03  %         0.05  %  \n  average                                                       \n  interes\u2026                                                      \n  assets                                                        \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  initial                                                       \n  negative    $     -4,609     $     -4,914     $    -5,645     \n  impact                                                        \n  toAOCI(\u2026                                                      \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  initial                                                       \n  impact                                                        \n  on                                                            \n  Common               -30              -30             -34     \n  Equity                                                        \n  Tier 1                                                        \n  Capital                                                       \n  ratio                                                         \n  (bps)                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) Certain trading-oriented\nbusinesses within Citi have\naccrual-accounted positions\nthat are excluded from the\nestimated impact to net\ninterest income in the table,\nsince these exposures are\nmanaged economically in\ncombination with mark-to-\nmarket positions. The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(179) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof December 31, 2021.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in\nthe estimated impact to net\ninterest income primarily\nreflected changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet composition and\nCiti Treasury positioning. The\nyear-over-year changes in the\nestimated impact to AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio primarily\nreflected the impact of the\ncomposition of Citi Treasury\u2019s\ninvestment and derivatives\nportfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, Citi\nexpects that the negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over a period of\ntime. As of December 31, 2021,\nCiti expects that the $4.6\nbillion negative\n\nimpact to AOCI in such a\nscenario could potentially be\noffset over approximately 27\nmonths.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  in\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $   563    $   647    $     86    $  -244    $   -770  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        612        655          41        -41        -353  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $  1,1\u2026    $  1,3\u2026    $    127    $  -285    $  -1,1\u2026  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -4,\u2026    $  -2,\u2026    $  -1,7\u2026    $  1,3\u2026    $  3,050  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -30        -19         -12          9          18  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously.

This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro, Singapore\ndollar and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its FX\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nIn addition, the effect of\nCiti\u2019s ongoing management\nstrategies with respect to\nquarterly changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the\nquarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio, are shown in the table\nbelow.

In addition, it excludes\nfees and other revenue\nassociated with capital\nmarkets origination\nactivities.

As shown in the\nchart below, positive trading-\nrelated revenue was achieved\nfor 95.8% of the trading days\nin 2021.\n                                                  \n  Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)\u2014Twelve  \n  Months Ended December 31, 2021In millions of    \n  dollars                                         \n                                                  \n(1) Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic\nhedges of certain AFS debt securities.

Citi\u2019s Global Market\nRisk function, within the\nIndependent Risk Management\norganization, works to ensure\nthat factor sensitivities are\ncalculated, monitored and\nlimited for all material risks\ntaken in the trading\nportfolios.\n                                                                \n  Value at Risk (VAR)                                           \n                                                                \nVAR estimates, at a 99%\nconfidence level, the\npotential decline in the value\nof a position or a portfolio\nunder normal market conditions\nassuming a one-day holding\nperiod. VAR statistics, which\nare based on historical data,\ncan be materially different\nacross firms due to\ndifferences in portfolio\ncomposition, differences in\nVAR methodologies and\ndifferences in model\nparameters. As a result, Citi\nbelieves VAR statistics can be\nused more effectively as\nindicators of trends in risk-\ntaking within a firm, rather\nthan as a basis for inferring\ndifferences in risk-taking\nacross firms.\n\nCiti uses a single,\nindependently approved Monte\nCarlo simulation VAR model\n(see \u201cVAR Model Review and\nValidation\u201d below), which has\nbeen designed to capture\nmaterial risk sensitivities\n(such as first- and second-\norder sensitivities of\npositions to changes in market\nprices) of\n\nvarious asset classes/risk\ntypes (such as interest rate,\ncredit spread, foreign\nexchange, equity and commodity\nrisks). Citi\u2019s VAR includes\npositions that are measured at\nfair value; it does not\ninclude investment securities\nclassified as AFS or HTM. For\ninformation on these\nsecurities, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCiti believes its VAR model is\nconservatively calibrated to\nincorporate fat-tail scaling\nand the greater of short-term\n(approximately the most recent\nmonth) and long-term (three\nyears) market volatility. The\nMonte Carlo simulation\ninvolves approximately 450,000\nmarket factors, making use of\napproximately 350,000 time\nseries, with sensitivities\nupdated daily, volatility\nparameters updated intra-\nmonthly and correlation\nparameters updated monthly.\nThe conservative features of\nthe VAR calibration contribute\nan approximate 33% add-on to\nwhat would be a VAR estimated\nunder the assumption of stable\nand perfectly, normally\ndistributed markets.\n\nAs set forth in the table\nbelow, Citi\u2019s average trading\nVAR decreased $5 million from\n2020 to 2021, mainly due to a\nreduction of market\nvolatility, given improved\nmacroeconomic conditions,\ncompared to 2020. Citi\u2019s\naverage trading and credit\nportfolio VAR decreased $24\nmillion from 2020 to 2021 due\nto VAR volatility\nrecalibration.\n\nYear-end and Average Trading\nVAR and Trading and

In addition, product specific back-testing on\nportfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing\nmodel performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi\u2019s\nU.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios\nacross the organization (trading desk level, ICG business\nsegment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S.\nbanking regulators. Material VAR model and assumption changes\nmust be independently validated within Citi\u2019s Independent Risk\nManagement organization. All model changes, including those for\nthe VAR model, are validated by the model validation group\nwithin Citi\u2019s Model Risk Management. In the event of significant\nmodel changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to\nimplementation. In addition, significant model and assumption\nchanges are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by\nCiti\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. Citi uses the same independently\nvalidated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management\nVAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios\nVARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for\nboth purposes is as described above. Regulatory VAR, which is\ncalculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk\nManagement VAR due to the fact that certain positions included\nin Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk\ntreatment in Regulatory VAR. The\n\ncomposition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under \u201cValue at\nRisk\u201d above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions\neligible for market risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital\nrules is periodically reviewed and approved by Citi\u2019s U.S.\nbanking regulators. In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR\nincludes all trading book-covered positions and all foreign\nexchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III,\nRegulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent\nand ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified\nas non-trading book and categories of exposures that are\nspecifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR\nexcludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from\nRegulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as\ncomputed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-\nweighted assets. Regulatory VAR Back-Testing In accordance with\nBasel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR\nback-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a\n99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit\nand loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is\nheld constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following\nday). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in\ncovered positions from the close of the previous business day.\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue,\nnet interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions.\n                              112                               \nThe following graph shows the\ndaily buy-and-hold profit and\nloss associated with Citi\u2019s\ncovered positions compared to\nCiti\u2019s one-day Regulatory VAR\nduring 2021. As of December\n31, 2021, one back-testing\nexception was observed at the\nCitigroup level.\n\nThe difference between the\n54.4% of days with buy-and-\nhold gains for Regulatory VAR\nback-testing and the 95.8% of\ndays with trading, net\ninterest and other revenue\nassociated with Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses, shown in the\nhistogram of daily trading-\nrelated revenue below,\nreflects, among other things,\nthat a significant portion of\nCiti\u2019s trading-related revenue\nis not generated from daily\nprice movements on these\npositions and exposures, as\nwell as differences in the\nportfolio composition of\nRegulatory VAR and Risk\nManagement VAR.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit     \n  and Loss(1)\u201412 Months ended December 31, 2021                 \n  In millions of dollars                                        \n                                                                \n(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking\nregulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market\nrevenue movement attributable to the trading position from the\nclose of the previous business day.

Therefore, it is not comparable to the\ntrading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-\nrelated revenue above.\n                              113                               \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nCiti performs market risk\nstress testing on a regular\nbasis to estimate the impact\nof extreme market movements.\nIt is performed on individual\npositions and trading\nportfolios, as well as in\naggregate, inclusive of\nmultiple trading portfolios.\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\nafter consultations with the\nbusinesses, develops both\nsystemic and specific stress\nscenarios, reviews the output\nof periodic stress testing\nexercises and uses the\ninformation to assess the\nongoing appropriateness of\nexposure levels and limits.\nCiti uses two complementary\napproaches to market risk\nstress testing across all\nmajor risk factors (i.e.,\nequity, foreign exchange,\ncommodity, interest rate and\ncredit spreads): top-down\nsystemic stresses and bottom-\nup business-specific stresses.\nSystemic stresses are designed\nto quantify the potential\nimpact of extreme market\nmovements on an institution-\nwide basis, and are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical periods of market\nstress and projections of\nadverse economic scenarios.\nBusiness-specific stresses are\ndesigned to probe the risks of\nparticular portfolios and\nmarket segments, especially\nthose risks that are not fully\ncaptured in VAR and systemic\nstresses.\n\nThe systemic stress scenarios\nand business-specific stress\nscenarios at Citi are used in\nseveral reports reviewed by\nsenior management and also to\ncalculate internal risk\ncapital for trading market\nrisk. In general, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na one-year horizon. For the\nmost liquid positions and\nmarket factors, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na shorter two-month horizon.\nThe limited set of positions\nand market factors whose\nmarket value changes are\ndefined over a two-month\nhorizon are those that in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment have\nhistorically remained very\nliquid during financial\ncrises, even as the trading\nliquidity of most other\npositions and market factors\nmaterially declined.\n                              114                               \n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nOperational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems\nor from external events. This\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements,\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from the failure of\nCiti to comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards, and contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nits businesses, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation\nrisks. Citi also recognizes\nthe impact of operational risk\non the reputation risk\nassociated with Citi\u2019s\nbusiness activities.\n\nOperational risk is inherent\nin Citi\u2019s global business\nactivities, as well as related\nsupport functions, and can\nresult in losses. Citi\nmaintains a comprehensive\nCiti-wide risk taxonomy to\nclassify operational risks\nthat it faces using\nstandardized definitions\nacross Citi\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement Framework (see\ndiscussion below). This\ntaxonomy also supports\nregulatory requirements and\nexpectations inclusive of\nthose related to U.S. Basel\nIII, Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR),\nHeightened Standards for Large\nFinancial Institutions and\nDodd Frank Annual Stress\nTesting (DFAST).\n\nCiti manages operational risk\nconsistent with the overall\nframework described in\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d above. Citi\u2019s\ngoal is to keep operational\nrisk at appropriate levels\nrelative to the\ncharacteristics of its\nbusinesses, the markets in\nwhich it operates, its capital\nand liquidity and the\ncompetitive, economic and\nregulatory environment. This\nincludes effectively managing\noperational risk and\nmaintaining or reducing\noperational risk exposures\nwithin Citi\u2019s operational risk\nappetite.\n\nCiti\u2019s Independent Operational\nRisk Management group has\nestablished a global-\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework with policies and\npractices for identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\nmanaging and reporting\noperational risks and the\noverall operating\neffectiveness of the internal\ncontrol environment. As part\nof this framework, Citi has\ndefined its operational risk\nappetite and established a\nmanager\u2019s control assessment\n(MCA) process for self-\nidentification of significant\noperational risks, assessment\nof the performance of key\ncontrols and mitigation of\nresidual risk above acceptable\nlevels.\n\nEach major business segment\nmust implement operational\nrisk processes consistent with\nthe requirements of this\nframework. This includes:\n\n\u2022 understanding the\noperational risks they are\nexposed to;\n\n\u2022 designing controls to\nmitigate identified risks;\n\n\u2022 establishing key indicators;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reporting\nwhether the operational risk\nexposures are in or out of\ntheir operational risk\nappetite;\n\n\u2022 having processes in place to\nbring operational risk\nexposures within acceptable\nlevels;\n\n\u2022 periodically estimate and\naggregate the operational\nrisks they are exposed to; and\n\n\u2022 ensuring that sufficient\nresources are available to\nactively improve the\noperational risk environment\nand mitigate emerging risks.\n\nCiti considers operational\nrisks that result from the\nintroduction of new or changes\nto existing products, or\nresult from significant\nchanges in its organizational\nstructures, systems, processes\nand personnel.\n\nCiti has a governance\nstructure for the oversight of\noperational risk exposures\nthrough Business Risk and\nControls Committees (BRCCs),\nwhich include a Citigroup BRCC\nas well as business,\nfunctions, regional and\ncountry BRCCs. BRCCs are\nchaired by the individuals in\nthe first line of defense and\nprovide escalation channels\nfor senior management to\nreview operational risk\nexposures including breaches\nof operational risk appetite,\nkey indicators, operational\nrisk events, and control\nissues. Membership includes\nsenior business and functions\nleadership as well as members\nof the second line of defense.\n\nIn addition, Independent Risk\nManagement, including the\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup, works proactively with\nCiti\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions to drive a strong\nand embedded operational risk\nmanagement culture and\nframework across Citi. The\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup actively challenges\nbusiness and functions\nimplementation of the\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework requirements and the\nquality of operational risk\nmanagement practices and\noutcomes.\n\nInformation about businesses\u2019\nkey operational risks,\nhistorical operational risk\nlosses and the control\nenvironment is reported by\neach major business segment\nand functional area. Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nrelated information is\nsummarized and reported to\nsenior management, as well as\nto the Audit and Risk\nCommittees of Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors by the Head of\nOperational Risk Management.\n\nOperational risk is measured\nthrough Operational Risk\nCapital and Operational Risk\nRegulatory Capital for the\nAdvanced Approaches under\nBasel III. Projected\noperational risk losses under\nstress scenarios are estimated\nas a required part of the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR process.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s operational risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisk\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCybersecurity risk is the\nbusiness risk associated with\nthe threat posed by a cyber\nattack, cyber breach or the\nfailure to protect Citi\u2019s most\nvital business information\nassets or operations,\nresulting in a financial or\nreputational loss (for\nadditional information, see\nthe operational processes and\nsystems and cybersecurity risk\nfactors in \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). With an evolving\nthreat landscape, ever-\nincreasing sophistication of\nthreat actor tactics,\ntechniques and procedures, and\nuse of new technologies to\nconduct financial\ntransactions, Citi and its\nclients, customers and third\nparties are and will continue\nto be at risk from cyber\nattacks and information\nsecurity incidents. Citi\nrecognizes the significance of\nthese risks and, therefore,\nleverages an intelligence-led\nstrategy to protect against,\ndetect and respond to, and\nrecover from cyber attacks.\nFurther, Citi actively\nparticipates in financial\nindustry, government and\ncross-sector knowledge-sharing\ngroups to enhance individual\nand collective cybersecurity\npreparedness and resilience.\n                              115                               \n                                                                \n  Risk Management                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s technology and\ncybersecurity risk management\nprogram is built on three\nlines of defense. Citi\u2019s first\nline of defense under the\nOffice of the Chief\nInformation Security Officer\nprovides frontline business,\noperational and technical\ncontrols and capabilities to\nprotect against cybersecurity\nrisks, and to respond to cyber\nincidents and data breaches.\nCiti manages these threats\nthrough state-of-the-art\nFusion Centers, which serve as\ncentral commands for\nmonitoring and coordinating\nresponses to cyber threats.\nThe enterprise information\nsecurity team is responsible\nfor infrastructure defense and\nsecurity controls, performing\nvulnerability assessments and\nthird-party information\nsecurity assessments, employee\nawareness and training\nprograms and security incident\nmanagement. In each case the\nteam works in coordination\nwith a network of information\nsecurity officers who are\nembedded within the businesses\nand functions globally.\n\nCiti\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nCyber (ORM-T/C) and\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nInformation Security (ICRM-T)\ngroups serve as the second\nline of defense, and actively\nevaluate, anticipate and\nchallenge Citi\u2019s risk\nmitigation practices and\ncapabilities. Citi seeks to\nproactively identify\n\nand remediate technology and\ncybersecurity risks before\nthey materialize as incidents\nthat negatively affect\nbusiness operations.\nAccordingly, the ORM-T/C team\nindependently challenges and\nmonitors capabilities in\naccordance with Citi\u2019s defined\nTechnology and Cyber Risk\nAppetite statements. To\naddress evolving cybersecurity\nrisks and corresponding\nregulations, ORM-T/C and\nICRM-T teams collectively also\nmonitor cyber legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nidentify and define emerging\nrisks, execute strategic cyber\nthreat assessments, perform\nnew products and initiative\nreviews, perform data\nmanagement risk oversight and\nconduct cyber risk assurance\nreviews (inclusive of third-\nparty assessments). In\naddition, ORM-T/C employs\ntools and oversees and\nchallenges metrics that are\nboth tailored to cybersecurity\n\nand technology and aligned\nwith Citi\u2019s overall\noperational risk management\nframework to effectively\ntrack, identify and\n\nmanage risk.\n\nInternal audit serves as the\nthird line of defense and\nindependently provides\nassurance on how effectively\nthe organization as a whole\nmanages cybersecurity risk.\nCiti also has multiple senior\ncommittees such as the\nInformation Security Risk\nCommittee (ISRC), which\ngoverns enterprise-level risk\ntolerance inclusive of\ncybersecurity risk.\n                                                                \n  Board Oversight                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors\nprovides oversight of\nmanagement\u2019s efforts to\nmitigate cybersecurity risk\nand respond to cyber\nincidents. The Board receives\nregular reports on\ncybersecurity and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the\nyear with management and\nsubject-matter experts on the\neffectiveness of Citi\u2019s\noverall cybersecurity program.\nThe Board also obtains updates\non Citi\u2019s inherent\ncybersecurity risks and Citi\u2019s\nroad map and progress for\naddressing these risks.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Board and its\ncommittee members receive\ncontemporaneous reporting on\nsignificant cyber events\nincluding response, legal\nobligations, and outreach and\nnotification to regulators,\nand customers when needed, as\nwell\n\nas guidance to management as\nappropriate. In 2021, the\nBoard of Directors underwent a\ncyber incident tabletop\nexercise. Also in 2021, the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee approved a\nstandalone Cybersecurity Risk\nAppetite Statement against\nwhich Citi\u2019s performance is\nmeasured quarterly. For\nadditional information on the\nBoard\u2019s oversight of\ncybersecurity risk management,\nsee Citi\u2019s 2022 proxy\nstatement to be filed with the\nSEC in March 2022.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCompliance risk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from violations of\nlaws, rules, or regulations,\nor from non-conformance with\nprescribed practices, internal\npolicies and procedures or\nethical standards. Compliance\nrisk exposes Citi to fines,\ncivil money penalties, payment\nof damages and the voiding of\ncontracts. Compliance risk can\nresult in diminished\nreputation, harm to Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, limited business\nopportunities and lessened\nexpansion potential. It\nencompasses the risk of\nnoncompliance with all laws\nand regulations, as well as\nprudent ethical standards and\nsome contractual obligations.\nIt could also include exposure\nto litigation (known as legal\nrisk) from all aspects of\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional banking.\n\nCiti seeks to operate with\nintegrity, maintain strong\nethical standards and adhere\nto applicable policies and\nregulatory and legal\nrequirements. Citi must\nmaintain and execute a\nproactive Compliance Risk\nManagement (CRM) Policy that\nis designed to manage\ncompliance risk effectively\nacross Citi, with a view to\nfundamentally strengthen the\ncompliance risk management\nculture across the lines of\ndefense taking into account\nCiti\u2019s risk governance\nframework and regulatory\nrequirements. Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\u2019s\n(ICRM) primary objectives are\nto:\n\n\u2022 Drive and embed a culture of\ncompliance and control\nthroughout Citi;\n\n\u2022 Maintain and oversee an\nintegrated CRM Policy and\nCompliance Risk Framework that\nfacilitates enterprise-wide\ncompliance with local,\nnational or cross-border laws,\nrules or regulations, Citi\u2019s\ninternal policies, standards\nand procedures and relevant\nstandards of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Assess compliance risks and\nissues across product lines,\nfunctions and geographies,\nsupported by globally\nconsistent systems and\ncompliance risk management\nprocesses; and\n\n\u2022 Provide compliance risk data\naggregation and reporting\ncapabilities.\n\nTo anticipate, control and\nmitigate compliance risk, Citi\nhas established the CRM Policy\nto achieve standardization and\ncentralization of\nmethodologies and processes,\nand to enable more consistent\nand comprehensive execution of\ncompliance risk management.\n\nCiti has a commitment, as well\nas an obligation, to identify,\nassess and mitigate compliance\nrisks associated with its\nbusinesses and functions. ICRM\nis responsible for oversight\nof Citi\u2019s CRM Policy, while\nall businesses and global\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for managing their\ncompliance risks and operating\nwithin the Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nCiti carries out its\nobjectives and fulfills its\nresponsibilities through the\nCompliance Risk Framework,\n                              116                               \nwhich is composed of the\nfollowing integrated key\nactivities, to holistically\nmanage compliance risk:\n\n\u2022 Management of Citi\u2019s\ncompliance with laws, rules\nand regulations by identifying\nand analyzing changes,\nassessing the impact, and\nimplementing appropriate\npolicies, processes and\ncontrols;\n\n\u2022 Developing and providing\ncompliance training to ensure\ncolleagues are aware of and\nunderstand the key laws, rules\nand regulations;\n\n\u2022 Monitoring the Compliance\nRisk Appetite, which is\narticulated through\nqualitative compliance risk\nstatements describing Citi\u2019s\nappetite for certain types of\nrisk and quantitative measures\nto monitor the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk exposure;\n\n\u2022 Monitoring and testing of\ncompliance risks and controls\nin assessing conformance with\nlaws, rules, regulations and\ninternal policies; and\n\n\u2022 Issue identification,\nescalation and remediation to\ndrive accountability,\nincluding measurement and\nreporting of compliance risk\nmetrics against established\nthresholds in support of the\nCRM Policy and Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi is\nworking to address the FRB and\nOCC consent orders, which\ninclude improvements to Citi\u2019s\nCompliance Risk Framework and\nits Enterprise-wide\napplication (for additional\ninformation regarding the\nconsent orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove).\n                                                                \n  REPUTATION RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s reputation is a vital\nasset in building trust with\nits stakeholders and Citi is\ndiligent in enhancing and\nprotecting its reputation with\nits colleagues, customers,\ninvestors and regulators. To\nsupport this, Citi has\ndeveloped a reputation risk\nframework. Under this\nframework, Citigroup and\nCitibank have implemented a\nrisk appetite statement and\nrelated key indicators to\nmonitor corporate activities\nand operations relative to our\nrisk appetite. The framework\nalso requires that business\nsegments and regions escalate\nsignificant reputation risks\nthat require review or\nmitigation through a\nReputation Risk Committee or\nequivalent.\n\nThe Reputation Risk\nCommittees, which are composed\nof Citi\u2019s most senior\nexecutives, govern the process\nby which material reputation\nrisks are identified,\nmonitored, reported, managed,\nand escalated. The Reputation\nRisk Committees determine the\nappropriate actions to be\ntaken in line with risk\nappetite and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting\na culture of risk awareness\nand high standards of\nintegrity and ethical behavior\nacross the Company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s mission and value\nproposition. The Reputation\nRisk Committees in the\nbusiness segments and regions\nare part of the governance\ninfrastructure that Citi has\nin place to review the\nreputation risk posed by\nbusiness activities, sales\npractices, product design, or\nperceived conflicts of\ninterest. These committees may\nalso raise potential\nreputation risks for due\nconsideration by the\nReputation Risk Committee at\nthe corporate level. The\nCitigroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee may escalate\nreputation risks to the\nNomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee or\nother appropriate committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n\nThe responsibility for\nenhancing and protecting\nCiti\u2019s reputation is shared by\nall colleagues, who are guided\nby Citi\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nColleagues are expected to\nexercise sound judgment and\ncommon sense in decisions and\nactions. They are also\nexpected to promptly escalate\nall issues that present\npotential reputation risk in\nline with policy.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nAs discussed above, strategic\nrisk is the risk of a\nsustained impact (not episodic\nimpact) to Citi\u2019s core\nstrategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization, or capital,\narising from the external\nfactors affecting the\nCompany\u2019s operating\nenvironment; as well as the\nrisks associated with defining\nthe strategy and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nIn this context, external\nfactors affecting Citi\u2019s\noperating environment are the\neconomic environment,\ngeopolitical/political\nlandscape,\nindustry/competitive\nlandscape, societal trends,\ncustomer/client behavior,\nregulatory/legislative\nenvironment and trends related\nto investors/shareholders.\n\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam is responsible for the\ndevelopment and execution of\nCiti\u2019s strategy. This strategy\nis translated into forward-\nlooking plans (collectively\nCiti\u2019s Strategic Plan) that\nare then cascaded across the\norganization. Citi\u2019s Strategic\nPlan is presented to the board\non an annual basis and is\naligned with Risk Appetite\nthresholds and includes Top\nRisk identification as\nrequired by internal\nframeworks. It is also aligned\nwith limit requirements for\ncapital allocation. Governance\nand oversight of strategic\nrisk is facilitated by\ninternal committees on a\ngroup-wide basis as well as\nstrategic committees at the\nICG , GCB and regional levels.\n\nCiti works to ensure that\nstrategic risks are adequately\nconsidered and addressed\nacross its various risk\nmanagement activities, and\nthat strategic risks are\nassessed in the context of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite. Citi\nconducts a top-down, bottom-up\nrisk identification process to\nidentify risks, including\nstrategic risks. Business\nsegments undertake a quarterly\nrisk identification process to\nsystematically identify and\ndocument all material risks\nfaced by Citi. Independent\nRisk Management oversees the\nRisk Identification process\nthrough regular reviews and\ncoordinates identification and\nmonitoring of Top Risks.\nIndependent Risk Management\nalso manages strategic risk by\nmonitoring risk appetite\nthresholds in conjunction with\nvarious strategic risk\ncommittees, which are part of\nthe governance structure that\nCiti has in place to manage\nits strategic risks.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s strategic risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  LIBOR Transition Risk                                         \n                                                                \nThe LIBOR administrator ceased\npublication of non-USD LIBOR\nand one week and two-month USD\nLIBOR on a representative\nbasis on December 31, 2021,\nwith plans to cease\npublication of all other USD\nLIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023.\nRegulators expect banks,\nincluding Citi, to have ceased\nentering into new contracts\nthat reference USD LIBOR as a\n                              117                               \nbenchmark by December 31,\n2021, except for limited\ncircumstances as set out in\nregulatory guidance.\n\nCiti recognizes that a\ntransition away from and\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR\npresents various risks and\nchallenges that could\nsignificantly impact financial\nmarkets and market\nparticipants, including Citi\n(for information about Citi\u2019s\nrisks from a transition away\nfrom and discontinuation of\nLIBOR or any other benchmark\nrates, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other\nRisks\u201d above). Accordingly,\nCiti has continued its efforts\nto identify and manage its\nLIBOR transition risks.\n\nFor example, Citi continues to\nclosely monitor legislative,\nregulatory and other\ndevelopments related to LIBOR\ntransition matters and\nlegislative relief. The\nInternational Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA)\npublished the Interbank\nOffered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks\nProtocol for existing IBOR\nderivatives transactions,\nwhich became effective in\nJanuary 2021. The IBOR\nFallbacks Protocol provides\nderivatives market\nparticipants with new\nfallbacks for legacy and new\nderivatives contracts if both\ncounterparties adhere to the\nprotocol or engage in\nbilateral amendments (see\ndiscussion below regarding\nCiti\u2019s adherence to the\nprotocol). In April 2021,\nlegislation was adopted in New\nYork State that provides for\nthe use of a statutory\nreplacement for USD LIBOR in\ncertain New York law legacy\ncontracts. Similar federal\nlegislation was passed in the\nHouse of Representatives in\nDecember 2021 and is pending\npassage by the Senate,\nalthough there is no guarantee\nthat the federal legislative\nproposal will become law.\n\nIn addition, Citi has\nestablished a LIBOR governance\nand implementation program\nfocused on identifying and\naddressing the impact of LIBOR\ntransition on Citi\u2019s clients,\noperational capabilities and\nfinancial contracts. The\nprogram operates globally\nacross Citi\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions and includes active\ninvolvement of senior\nmanagement, oversight by\nCiti\u2019s Asset and Liability\nCommittee and reporting to the\nRisk Management Committee of\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. As part of the\nprogram, Citi has continued to\nimplement its LIBOR transition\naction plans and associated\nroadmaps under the following\nkey workstreams: program\nmanagement; transition\nstrategy and risk management;\ncustomer management, including\ninternal communications and\ntraining, legal/contract\nmanagement and product\nmanagement; financial\nexposures and risk management;\nregulatory and industry\nengagement; operations and\ntechnology; and finance, risk,\ntax and treasury.\n\nDuring 2021, Citi continued to\nparticipate in a number of\nworking groups formed by\nglobal regulators, including\nthe Alternative Reference\nRates Committee (ARRC)\nconvened by the FRB. These\nworking groups promote and\nadvance development of\nalternative reference rates\nand seek to identify and\naddress potential challenges\nfrom any transition to such\nrates. Citi\u2019s LIBOR transition\naction plans and associated\nroadmaps are intended to be\nconsistent with the timelines\nrecommended by these working\ngroups. This includes the\nCommodity Futures Trading\nCommission\u2019s SOFR First\nInitiative, which is designed\nto promote derivatives trading\nin SOFR. Citi also continued\nto engage with regulators,\nfinancial accounting bodies\nand others on LIBOR transition\nmatters.\n\nCiti\u2019s LIBOR transition\nefforts include, among other\nthings, reducing its overall\nexposure to LIBOR, increasing\n\nCiti\u2019s virtual client\ncommunication efforts and\nclient transition\nfacilitation, including\noutreach regarding new\nindustry-led protocols and\nsolutions, and using\nalternative reference rates in\ncertain newly issued financial\ninstruments and products. In\nthe past several years, Citi\nhas issued preferred stock and\nbenchmark debt referencing the\nSecured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR) and issued\ncustomer-related debt\nreferencing SOFR and the\nSterling Overnight Interbank\nAverage Rate (SONIA), the\nrecommended replacement rate\nfor Sterling LIBOR. Citi has\nalso originated and arranged\nloans referencing SOFR and\nSONIA and executed SOFR and\nSONIA-based derivatives\ncontracts. Further, Citi has\nalso been investing in its\nsystems and infrastructure, as\nclient activity moves away\nfrom LIBOR to alternative\nreference rates. Since the\nARRC\u2019s recommendation of CME\nGroup\u2019s Term SOFR in July\n2021, Citi has focused on\nsystems\u2019 readiness to provide\nTerm SOFR loan and derivatives\nto clients, where permitted.\n\nIn 2021, Citi also focused on\nremediating existing LIBOR\ncontracts for which\npublication ceased on a\nrepresentative basis on\nDecember 31, 2021.\nSubstantially all of these\ncontracts were remediated by\nDecember 31, 2021, and Citi\ncontinues to actively engage\nin and track the remediation\nof any remaining contracts\nafter December 31, 2021. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, Citi\u2019s\noverall USD LIBOR gross\nnotional exposure for\ncontracts maturing after the\nLIBOR cessation date of June\n30, 2023 was approximately\n$7.1 trillion, which includes\napproximately $4 trillion of\ncleared derivatives that are\ncovered by planned Central\nCounterparty Clearing House\n(CCP) conversions, and\napproximately $2.4 trillion of\nbilateral derivatives that are\ncovered by robust contract\nfallback language. The\nremaining exposure of\napproximately $0.7 trillion\nincludes bilateral derivatives\nand cash products that will be\naddressed by 2022 contract\nremediation plans.\n\nIn addition, for LIBOR\ncontracts that have not yet\nbeen remediated, Citi\ncontinues to review the effect\nof relevant legislative\nsolutions, which are expected\nto facilitate the transition\nto replacement rates.\n                                                                \n  Climate Risk                                                  \n                                                                \nClimate change presents\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its clients and\ncustomers, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risk refers to\nthe risk of loss arising from\nclimate change and is\ncomprised of both physical\nrisk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk considers how\nchronic and acute climate\nchange (e.g., increased\nstorms, drought, fires,\nfloods) can directly damage\nphysical assets (e.g., real\nestate, crops) or otherwise\nimpact their value or\nproductivity. Transition risk\nconsiders how changes in\npolicy, technology, business\npractices and market\npreferences to address climate\nchange (e.g., carbon pricing\npolicies, power generation\nshifts from fossil fuels to\nrenewable energy) can lead to\nchanges in the value of\nassets, commodities and\ncompanies.\n\nClimate risk is an overarching\nrisk that can act as a driver\nof other categories of risk,\nsuch as credit risk from\nobligors exposed to high\nclimate risk, reputational\nrisk from increased\nstakeholder concerns about\nfinancing high-carbon\nindustries and operational\nrisk from physical risks to\nCiti\u2019s facilities and\npersonnel.\n\nCiti currently identifies\nclimate risk as an \u201cemerging\nrisk\u201d within its enterprise\nrisk management framework.\nEmerging\n                              118                               \nrisks are risks or thematic\nissues that are either new to\nthe landscape, or in the case\nof climate risk, existing\nrisks that are rapidly\nchanging or evolving in an\nescalating fashion, which are\ndifficult to assess due to\nlimited data or other\nuncertainties. For additional\ninformation on climate risk,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCiti reviews factors related\nto climate risk under its\nlongstanding Environmental and\nSocial Risk Management (ESRM)\nPolicy, which includes a focus\non climate risk related to\nfinanced projects and clients\nin high-carbon sectors.\nCautious of the credit risk of\nstranded assets, as well as\nthe reputational risks\nassociated with the coal\nsector due to its high carbon\nemissions, Citi began a phase-\ndown of its financing of\nthermal coal mining companies\nin 2015 and of new coal-fired\npower plants in 2018. As\nCiti\u2019s phase-down has\ncontinued, Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy\nwas updated to include a\nprohibition on all project-\nrelated financing of new coal-\nfired power plants and new or\nexpanding thermal coal mines\nas well as clear timetables to\nreduce financing of companies\nwith high exposure to coal\nfired power and coal mining\nwho do not pursue low-carbon\ntransition in the coming\nyears. These sector approaches\nallow Citi to set a\ncomprehensive and industry-\nwide approach to clarify its\npositions, set clear\nexpectations for its clients\nand help address certain\nclimate risk driven credit\nrisk concerns while reducing\nreputation risk.\n\nCiti continues to explore and\ntest methodologies for\nquantifying how climate risks\ncould impact the individual\ncredit profiles of its clients\nacross various sectors. To\nassist in embedding climate\nrisk assessments in its credit\nassessment process, Citi is\ndeveloping sector-specific\nclimate risk assessments. Such\nclimate risk assessments are\ndesigned to supplement\npublicly available client\ndisclosures and data provided\nfrom third-party vendors and\nfacilitate conversations with\nclients on their most material\nclimate risks and management\nplans for adaptation and\nmitigation. In the near term,\nCiti\u2019s assessments will\nconsider sectors that have\nbeen identified as higher\nclimate risk by Citi\u2019s risk\nidentification process. This\nwill not only help Citi better\nunderstand its clients\u2019\nbusinesses and climate-related\nrisks, but will also provide a\nsource of climate data. Citi\u2019s\nnet zero plan is leading to\nthe further integration of\nclimate risk discussions into\nclient engagement and client\nselection.\n\nFurthermore, Citi is\ndeveloping globally consistent\nprinciples and approaches for\nmanaging climate risk across\nCiti. Climate risk will be\nembedded into relevant\npolicies and processes over\ntime.\n\nIn addition, Citi continues to\nparticipate in financial\nindustry collaborations to\ndevelop and pilot new\nmethodologies and approaches\nfor measuring and assessing\nthe potential financial risks\nof climate change. Citi is\nalso closely monitoring\nregulatory developments on\nclimate risk and sustainable\nfinance, and actively engaging\nwith regulators on these\ntopics.\n\nFor additional information\nabout sustainability and other\nESG matters at Citi, see\n\u201cSustainability and Other ESG\nMatters\u201d above.\n                              119                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2021.\n(Including the U.S., the total\nexposure as of December 31,\n2021 to the top 25 countries\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 33% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (36% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n87% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 88% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

As\nof December 31, 2021, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its\nArgentine operations was\napproximately $1.5 billion.\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar as\nthe functional currency for\nits operations in highly\ninflationary countries under\nU.S. GAAP. Citi uses\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate to remeasure its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets into the U.S. dollar.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the\nofficial Argentine peso\nexchange rate against the U.S.\ndollar was 102.73.\n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina\nmaintains certain capital and\ncurrency controls that\ngenerally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nsubstantially all of its\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations. Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely to\nincrease as Citi continues to\ngenerate net income from its\nArgentine franchise and the\nmajority of its earnings\ncannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of December\n31, 2021, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge nearly all of its\nArgentine peso exposure. As a\nresult, and to the extent that\nCiti does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof December 31, 2021. However,\nU.S. regulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentine exposures, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Russia                                                        \n                                                                \nCiti operates both its ICG and\nGCB businesses in Russia,\nalthough the Company is\ncurrently pursuing the exit of\nits GCB business in the\ncountry. All of Citi\u2019s\ndomestic operations in Russia\nare conducted through a\nsubsidiary of Citibank, which\nuses the Russian ruble as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in Russia was\napproximately $1 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The\nmajority of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment was hedged for\nforeign currency depreciation\nas of December 31, 2021, using\nforward foreign exchange\ncontracts. Citi\u2019s total third-\nparty exposure was\napproximately $8.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2021. These\nassets primarily consisted of\ncorporate and consumer loans,\nlocal government debt\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and cash on\ndeposit and placements with\nthe Bank of Russia and other\nfinancial institutions. A\nsignificant portion of Citi\u2019s\nthird-party exposures were\nfunded with domestic deposit\nliabilities from both ICG and\nGCB clients. Further, Citi has\napproximately $1.6 billion of\nadditional exposures to\nRussian counterparties that\nare not held on the Russian\nsubsidiary and are not\nincluded in the $8.2 billion\nabove.\n\nThe $5.4 billion in Russia\ncredit and other exposures in\nthe \u201cTop 25 Country Exposures\u201d\ntable above does not include\napproximately $1.0 billion of\ncash and placements with the\nBank of Russia and other\nfinancial institutions and\n$1.8 billion of reverse\nrepurchase agreements with\nvarious counterparties.\n\nCiti continues to monitor the\ncurrent Russia\u2013Ukraine\ngeopolitical situation and\neconomic conditions and will\nmitigate its exposures and\nrisks as appropriate.

As an example, because\ntotal outstandings under FFIEC\nguidelines do not include the\nbenefit of margin or hedges,\nmarket volatility in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates\nand credit spreads may cause\nsignificant fluctuations in\nthe level of total\noutstandings, all else being\nequal.\n                              122                               \nThe tables below show each country whose total outstandings\nexceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Non-bank financial institutions.\n\n(2) Included in total outstanding.\n\n(3) Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third\nparties, as well as local country assets.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements contains a summary\nof all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of\n\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices in\nactive markets to determine\nfair value and classifies such\nitems within Level 1 of the\nfair value hierarchy\nestablished under ASC 820-10,\nFair Value Measurement . If\nquoted market prices are not\navailable, fair value is based\non internally developed\nvaluation models that use,\nwhere possible, current\nmarket-based or independently\nsourced market parameters,\nsuch as interest rates,\ncurrency rates and option\nvolatilities. Such models are\noften based on a discounted\ncash flow analysis. In\naddition, items valued using\nsuch internally generated\nvaluation techniques are\nclassified according to the\nlowest level input or value\ndriver that is significant to\nthe valuation. Thus, an item\nmay be classified under the\nfair value hierarchy as Level\n3 even though there may be\nsome significant inputs that\nare readily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

In addition,\nCiti reserves for expected\ncredit losses on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses a forward-\nlooking base macroeconomic\nforecast. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects economic\nuncertainty using alternative\ndownside macroeconomic\nscenarios and portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as adjustments\nto reflect uncertainty around\nthe estimated impact of the\npandemic on credit losses.\nBoth the quantitative and\nqualitative management\nadjustment components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation, and (iv) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables that\ninform the forecasts, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand operating segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates (among\nother things), as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP). This methodology is\napplied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic\nregion in which these\nportfolios exist.\n\nThis evaluation process is\nsubject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. The frequency\nof default, risk ratings, loss\nrecovery rates, size and\ndiversity of individual large\ncredits and ability of\nborrowers with foreign\ncurrency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary\nfor orderly debt servicing,\namong other things, are all\ntaken into account.\n                              125                               \nChanges in these estimates\ncould have a direct impact on\nCiti\u2019s credit costs and the\nallowance in any period.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect\neconomic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of\ndownside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as\nconcentrations, collateral\nvaluation, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nfactors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent also reflects the\nuncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates. The ultimate extent\nof the pandemic\u2019s impact on\nCiti\u2019s ACL will depend on,\namong other things, (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\nconclusion of government\nstimulus and assistance\nprograms, (ii) the impact on\nunemployment, (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery, (iv) the severity\nand duration of any resurgence\nof COVID-19, (v) the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of vaccines and\n(vi) the extent of any market\nvolatility. 4Q21 Changes in\nthe ACL In the fourth quarter\nof 2021, Citi released $1.0\nbillion of the ACL for its\nconsumer portfolios and $0.4\nbillion of the ACL for its\ncorporate portfolios, for a\ntotal release of $1.4 billion.\nThe releases in the consumer\nand corporate ACLs were driven\nprimarily by the continued\nimprovement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook, as well\nas continued improvements in\ncredit quality. The overall\nqualitative management\nadjustments declined compared\nto the previous quarter. Based\non its latest macroeconomic\nforecast, Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic environment as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nmacroeconomic variables for\nboth the base and downside\nmacroeconomic forecasts it\nuses to estimate the ACL,\nincluding domestic and\ninternational variables for\nits global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The\ntables below show Citi\u2019s\nforecasted quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate and\nyear-over-year U.S. Real GDP\ngrowth rate used in\ndetermining Citi\u2019s ACL for\neach quarterly reporting\nperiod from 4Q20 to 4Q21:\n                                                                \n                     Quarterly                                  \n                       average                                  \n  U.S.                    4Q21    2Q22    4Q22      13-quarter  \n  unemployme\u2026                                       average(1)  \n  Citi                                                          \n  forecast at              6.3     6.1     5.7             6.1  \n  4Q20                                                          \n  Citi                                                          \n  forecast at              4.9     4.1     3.8             4.3  \n  1Q21                                                          \n  Citi                                                          \n  forecast at              4.6     4.1     3.9             4.1  \n  2Q21                                                          \n  Citi                                                          \n  forecast at              4.5     4.1     3.9             4.0  \n  3Q21                                                          \n  Citi                                                          \n  forecast at              4.3     4.0     3.8             3.8  \n  4Q21                                                          \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking 13\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                         Year-over-year growth                  \n                                       rate(1)                  \n                                     Full year                  \n  U.S. Real GDP                           2021    2022    2023  \n  Citi forecast at                         3.7     2.7     2.6  \n  4Q20                                                          \n  Citi forecast at                         6.2     4.1     1.9  \n  1Q21                                                          \n  Citi forecast at                         6.5     3.7     2.0  \n  2Q21                                                          \n  Citi forecast at                         5.9     3.9     2.1  \n  3Q21                                                          \n  Citi forecast at                         5.5     4.0     2.2  \n  4Q21                                                          \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the Real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level.

Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL release\n(including Corporate/Other )\nof $1.0 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACLL balance to $13.6 billion,\nor 5.0% of total consumer\nloans as of December 31, 2021.\nThe release was primarily\ndriven by the continued\nimprovement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook, as well\nas continued improvements in\ncredit quality. Citi\u2019s\nconsumer ACLL is largely\ndriven by the cards\nbusinesses. For cards,\nincluding Citi\u2019s international\nbusinesses, the level of\nreserves relative to EOP loans\ndecreased to 7.9% as of\nDecember 31, 2021, compared to\n9.1% at September 30, 2021,\nprimarily driven by by the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook, as well\nas continued improvements\n                              126                               \nin credit quality. For the\nremaining consumer exposures,\nthe level of reserves relative\nto EOP loans was 1.4% at\nDecember 31, 2021, essentially\nunchanged from September 30,\n2021.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti\u2019s corporate ACLL release\nof $0.2 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACLL reserve balance to $2.8\nbillion, or 0.73% of total\nfunded loans. The release was\nprimarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as\nimprovement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe Allowance for credit\nlosses on unfunded lending\ncommitments (ACLUC) release of\n$191 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 decreased the\ntotal ACLUC reserve balance\nincluded in Other liabilities\nto $1.9 billion at December\n31, 2021.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2021, the\nratio of the allowance for\ncredit losses to total funded\nloans was 2.49% (5.02% for\nconsumer loans and 0.73% for\ncorporate loans) compared to\n2.69% at September 30, 2021\n(5.55% for consumer loans and\n0.77% for corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $3.4 billion at December\n31, 2021, down $610 million\nfrom September 30, 2021.\nConsumer non-accrual loans\ndecreased $87 million to $1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2021\nfrom $1.6 billion at September\n30, 2021, while corporate non-\naccrual loans decreased $523\nmillion to $1.9 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 from $2.4\nbillion at September 30, 2021.\nIn addition, the ratio of non-\naccrual loans to total\nconsumer loans was 0.55% and\nnon-accrual loans to total\ncorporate loans was 0.47%, at\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes.

The\nallocated equity in the\nreporting units is determined\nbased on the capital the\nbusiness would require if it\nwere operating as a standalone\nentity, incorporating\nsufficient capital to be in\ncompliance with both current\nand expected regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding capital for\nspecifically identified\ngoodwill and intangible\nassets. The capital allocated\nto the reporting units is\nincorporated into the annual\nbudget process, which is\napproved by Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing\ninvolves management judgment,\nrequiring an assessment of\nwhether the carrying value of\na reporting unit can be\nsupported by its fair value of\nthe reporting unit using\nwidely accepted valuation\ntechniques, such as the market\napproach (earnings multiples\nand/or transaction multiples)\nand/or the income approach\n(discounted cash flow (DCF)\nmethod). In applying these\nmethodologies, Citi utilizes a\nnumber of factors, including\nactual operating results,\nfuture business plans,\neconomic projections and\nmarket data.\n\nSimilar to 2020, Citi engaged\nan independent valuation\nspecialist in 2021 to assist\nin Citi\u2019s valuation of all the\nreporting units, employing\nboth the market approach and\nthe DCF method. The resulting\nfair values were relatively\nconsistent and appropriate\nweighting was given to outputs\nfrom both methods. The DCF\nmethod utilized at the time of\neach impairment test used\ndiscount rates that Citi\nbelieves adequately reflected\nthe risk and uncertainty in\nthe financial markets in the\ninternally generated cash flow\nprojections.\n\nThe DCF method employs a\ncapital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate.\nSince none of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units are publicly\ntraded, individual reporting\nunit fair value determinations\ncannot be directly correlated\nto Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice. The sum of the fair\nvalues of the reporting units\nexceeded the overall market\ncapitalization of Citi as of\nJuly 1, 2021. However, Citi\nbelieves that it is not\nmeaningful to reconcile the\nsum of the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units to\nits market capitalization due\nto several factors. The market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\nreflects the execution risk in\na transaction involving\nCitigroup due to its size.\nHowever, the individual\nreporting units\u2019 fair values\nare not subject to the same\nlevel of execution risk nor a\nbusiness model that is as\ninternational. In addition,\nthe market capitalization of\nCitigroup does not include\nconsideration of the\nindividual reporting unit\u2019s\ncontrol premium.\n\nCiti performed its annual\ngoodwill impairment test as of\nJuly 1, 2021. The fair values\nof Citi\u2019s reporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from\napproximately 125% to 153%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the economic and\nbusiness\n                              127                               \nenvironments continue to\nevolve as management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh, which includes, among\nothers, the exits of consumer\nbusinesses in 13 markets in\nAsia and EMEA , as well as the\nexit of the Mexico consumer,\nsmall business and middle-\nmarket banking operations. If\nmanagement\u2019s future estimate\nof key economic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture. Citi expects that the\nimplementation of its new\noperating segments and\nreporting units in the first\nquarter of 2022, as well as\nthe timing and sequencing of\nthe sales of its Asia consumer\nbanking businesses, may result\nin goodwill impairment. See\nNotes 1 and 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for additional\ninformation on goodwill,\nincluding the changes in the\ngoodwill balance year-over-\nyear and the segments\u2019\ngoodwill balances as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                                                \n  Income Taxes                                                  \n                                                                \nOverview\n\nCiti is subject to the income\ntax laws of the U.S., its\nstates and local\nmunicipalities and the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in\nwhich Citi operates. These tax\nlaws are complex and are\nsubject to differing\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing\nauthorities. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax\nlaws may be subject to review\nand adjudication by the court\nsystems of the various tax\njurisdictions or may be\nsettled with the taxing\nauthority upon audit.\n\nIn establishing a provision\nfor income tax expense, Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these\ninherently complex tax laws.\nCiti must also make estimates\nabout when in the future\ncertain items will affect\ntaxable income in the various\ntax jurisdictions, both\ndomestic and foreign. Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the\nfuture consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in\nthe financial statements or\ntax returns, based upon\nenacted tax laws and rates.\nDeferred tax assets (DTAs) are\nrecognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment that\nrealization is more-likely-\nthan-not. For example, if it\nis more-likely-than-not that a\ncarry-forward would expire\nunused, Citi would set up a\nvaluation allowance (VA)\nagainst that DTA. Citi has\nestablished valuation\nallowances as described below.\n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (Tax Reform),\nbeginning in 2018, Citi is\ntaxed on income generated by\nits U.S. operations at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%. The\neffect on Citi\u2019s state tax\nrate is dependent upon how and\nwhen the individual states\nthat have not yet addressed\nthe federal tax law changes\nchoose to adopt the various\nnew provisions of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\nCiti\u2019s non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries are subject to\ntax at their local tax rates.\nNon-U.S. branches also\ncontinue to be subject to U.S.\ntaxation. The impact of this\non Citi\u2019s earnings depends on\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and allocations of\noverall domestic loss (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to branch earnings.\nCiti expects no residual U.S.\ntax on such earnings since it\ncurrently has sufficient\nbranch tax carry-forwards.\nWith respect to non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, dividends from\nthese subsidiaries are\nexcluded from U.S. taxation.\nWhile the majority of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\nare classified\n\nas Global Intangible Low Taxed\nIncome (GILTI), Citi expects\nno material residual U.S. tax\non such earnings based on its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 local\ntax rates, which exceed, on\naverage, the GILTI tax rate.\nFinally, Citi does not expect\nthe Base Erosion Anti-Abuse\nTax (BEAT) to affect its tax\nprovision.\n                                                                \n  Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances                  \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2021, Citi had\nnet DTAs of $24.8 billion. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2021,\nCiti\u2019s DTAs increased by $0.3\nbillion, primarily as a result\nof losses in Other\ncomprehensive income . On a\nfull-year basis, Citi\u2019s DTAs\nat December 31, 2021 were\nessentially unchanged from\n$24.8 billion at December 31,\n2020.\n\nOf Citi\u2019s total net DTAs of\n$24.8 billion as of December\n31, 2021, $9.5 billion,\nprimarily related to tax\ncarry-forwards, was deducted\nin calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. Net DTAs\narising from temporary\ndifferences are deducted from\nregulatory capital if in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the\nquarter and year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, Citi did\nnot have any such DTAs.\nAccordingly, the remaining\n$15.3 billion of net DTAs as\nof December 31, 2021 was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to\nBasel III standards, and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder those rules.\n\nCiti\u2019s total VA at December\n31, 2021 was $4.2 billion, a\ndecrease of $1.0 billion from\n$5.2 billion at December 31,\n2020. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by usage of\ncarry-forwards and expirations\nin the FTC branch basket.\nCiti\u2019s VA of $4.2 billion is\ncomposed of $2.5 billion on\nits FTC carry-forwards, $1.0\nbillion on its U.S. residual\nDTA related to its non-U.S.\nbranches, $0.6 billion on\nlocal non-U.S. DTAs and $0.1\nbillion on state net operating\nloss carry-forwards.\n\nIn 2021, Citi reduced its VA\nfor DTAs related to FTCs in\nits branch basket for 2021 and\nfuture periods. As stated\nabove with regard to the\nimpact of non-U.S. branches on\nCiti\u2019s earnings, the level of\nbranch pretax income, the\nlocal branch tax rate and the\nallocations of ODL and\nexpenses for U.S. tax purposes\nto the branch basket are the\nmain factors in determining\nthe branch VA. The allocated\nODL was enhanced by\nsignificant taxable income\ngenerated in the current year.\nIn addition, during 2021, the\nglobal interest rate\nenvironment and balance sheet\nrequirements in non-U.S.\nbranches resulted in a lower\nrelative allocation of\ninterest expense to non-U.S.\nbranches. The combination of\nthe factors enumerated\nresulted in a VA release of\n$0.2 billion. Citi also\nreleased branch basket VA of\n$0.1 billion with respect to\nfuture years, based upon\nCiti\u2019s operating plan and\nestimates of future branch\nbasket factors, as outlined\nabove.\n\nCiti\u2019s VA of $0.8 billion\nagainst FTC carry-forwards in\nits general basket was reduced\nby $0.2 billion in 2021,\nprimarily as a result of audit\nadjustments made to prior\nyears\u2019 returns. In Citi\u2019s\ngeneral basket for FTCs,\nchanges in the forecasted\namount of income in U.S.\nlocations derived from sources\noutside the U.S., in addition\nto tax examination changes\nfrom prior years, could alter\nthe amount of valuation\nallowance that is needed\nagainst such FTCs. Citi\ncontinues to look for\nadditional actions that may\nbecome prudent and feasible,\ntaking into account client,\nregulatory and operational\n                              128                               \nconsiderations. (See Note 9 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements.)\n\nRecognized FTCs comprised\napproximately $2.8 billion of\nCiti\u2019s DTAs as of December 31,\n2021, compared to\napproximately $4.4 billion as\nof December 31, 2020. The\ndecrease in FTCs year-over-\nyear was primarily due to\ncurrent-year usage. The FTC\ncarry-forward period\nrepresents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs.\n\nCiti has an ODL of\napproximately $15 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021, which\nallows Citi to elect a\npercentage between 50% and\n100% of future years\u2019 domestic\nsource income to be\nreclassified as foreign source\nincome. (See Note 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for a description\nof the ODL.)\n\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nfederal net operating loss\ncarry-forward and all of its\nNew York State and City net\noperating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward\nperiod of 20 years. This\nprovides enough time to fully\nutilize the net DTAs\npertaining to these existing\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. This is due to\nCiti\u2019s forecast of sufficient\nU.S. taxable income and the\ncontinued taxation of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income by New York\nState and City.\n\nAlthough realization is not\nassured, Citi believes that\nthe realization of its\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.8\nbillion at December 31, 2021\nis more-likely-than-not, based\nupon management\u2019s expectations\nof future taxable income in\nthe jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\navailable tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC\nTopic 740, Income Taxes ).\nCiti has concluded that it has\nthe necessary positive\nevidence to support the\nrealization of its net DTAs\nafter taking its valuation\nallowances into consideration.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s income taxes, including\nits income tax provision, tax\nassets and liabilities and a\ntabular summary of Citi\u2019s net\nDTAs balance as of December\n31, 2021 (including the FTCs\nand applicable expiration\ndates of the FTCs), see Note 9\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. For information on\nCiti\u2019s ability to use its\nDTAs, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d above\nand Note 9 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Potential U.S. Tax Legislation                                \n                                                                \nOn January 4, 2022, final FTC\nregulations were published in\nthe Federal Register. These\nregulations eliminate the\ncreditability of foreign taxes\npaid in certain situations.\nThese include countries that\ndo not align with U.S. tax\nprinciples in significant part\nand for services performed\noutside the recipient country.\nCiti is examining the extent\nto which these regulations\nwill impact its effective tax\nrate. Any adoption effect on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including its\nvaluation allowance against\nFTC carry-forwards, will be\nreported in the first quarter\nof 2022. Citi does not expect\na significant impact on its\n2022 effective tax rate.\nHowever, the U.S. president\u2019s\nproposed legislation discussed\nbelow, if enacted, could\nexacerbate the impact of these\nregulations.\n\nThe president has proposed the\nBuild Back Better Act, which\nmakes substantial changes to\nthe taxation of multinational\ncorporations. While the Act\ndoes not presently contain an\nincrease to the U.S. corporate\ntax rate, it would impose a\nminimum level of U.S.\ntaxation, computed on a\njurisdiction by jurisdiction\nbasis.

Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the\nreliability of its financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that\n(i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of Citi\u2019s assets,\n(ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of\nfinancial statements in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles\nand that Citi\u2019s receipts and\nexpenditures are made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof Citi\u2019s management and\ndirectors and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of Citi\u2019s\nassets that could have a\nmaterial effect on its\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect all\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCiti\u2019s management assessed the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021 based on the\ncriteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) . Based on this\nassessment, management\nbelieves that, as of December\n31, 2021, Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was effective. In\naddition, there were no\nchanges in Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended December 31,\n2021 that materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nThe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021 has been\naudited by KPMG LLP, Citi\u2019s\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in\ntheir report below, which\nexpressed an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                              132                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nForm 10-K, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin the Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and\nResults of Operations, are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the U.S.\nPrivate Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995.

Such statements\nmay be identified by words\nsuch as believe, expect,\nanticipate, intend, estimate,\nmay increase, may fluctuate,\ntarget and illustrative, and\nsimilar expressions or future\nor conditional verbs such as\nwill, should, would and could.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u2019s current\nexpectations and are subject\nto risks, uncertainties and\nchanges in circumstances.\nActual results and capital and\nother financial conditions may\ndiffer materially from those\nincluded in these statements\ndue to a variety of factors,\nincluding without limitation\n(i) the precautionary\nstatements included within\neach individual business\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis of its\nresults of operations and (ii)\nthe factors listed and\ndescribed under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nabove.\n\nAny forward-looking statements\nmade by or on behalf of\nCitigroup speak only as to the\ndate they are made, and Citi\ndoes not undertake to update\nforward-looking statements to\nreflect the impact of\ncircumstances or events that\narise after the forward-\nlooking statements were made.\n                              133                               \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board\nof Directors\n\nCitigroup Inc.:\n\nOpinions on the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the\naccompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Citigroup\nInc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, the related\nconsolidated statements of\nincome, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019\nequity and cash flows for each\nof the years in the three-year\nperiod ended December 31,\n2021, and the related notes\n(collectively, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements). We also have\naudited the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the\nfinancial position of the\nCompany as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, and the results\nof its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2021, in\nconformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Also in our\nopinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2021 based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, the Company has\nchanged its method of\naccounting for the recognition\nand measurement of credit\nlosses as of January 1, 2020\ndue to the adoption of ASC\nTopic 326, Financial\nInstruments \u2013 Credit Losses.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is\nresponsible for these\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining\neffective internal control\nover financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, included in the\naccompanying management\u2019s\nannual report on internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards\nof the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free\nof material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud,\nand whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as\nevaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other\nprocedures as we considered\nnecessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that\nour audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is a\nprocess designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal purposes in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of\nthe company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\n                              134                               \ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are matters\narising from the current\nperiod audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit\ncommittee and that (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved\nour especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication\nof critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value\nof certain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 24\nand 25 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nwere $856.6 billion and $313.4\nbillion, respectively at\nDecember 31, 2021. The Company\nestimated the fair value of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities\nmeasured on a recurring basis\n($14.7 billion and $35.2\nbillion, respectively at\nDecember 31, 2021) utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques\nwith one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers being unobservable\nincluding, but not limited to,\ncomplex internal valuation\nmodels, alternative pricing\nprocedures or comparables\nanalysis and discounted cash\nflows.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the measurement of fair\nvalue for certain Level 3\nassets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as a critical\naudit matter. A high degree of\neffort, including specialized\nskills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor\njudgment was involved in the\nassessment of the Level 3 fair\nvalues due to measurement\nuncertainty. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the fair value\nmethodology, including\nmethods, models and\nsignificant assumptions and\ninputs used to estimate fair\nvalue. Significant assumptions\nand inputs include interest\nrate, price, yield, credit\nspread, volatilities,\ncorrelations and forward\nprices. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance of the valuation\nmodels.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in evaluating the\ndesign and testing the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s Level\n3 fair value measurements,\nincluding controls over:\n\n\u2022 valuation methodologies,\nincluding significant inputs\nand assumptions\n\n\u2022 independent price\nverification\n\n\u2022 evaluating that significant\nmodel assumptions and inputs\nreflected those which a market\nparticipant\n\nwould use to determine an exit\nprice in the current market\nenvironment\n\n\u2022 the valuation models used\nwere mathematically accurate\nand appropriate to value the\nfinancial instruments\n\n\u2022 relevant information used\nwithin the Company\u2019s models\nthat was reasonably available\nwas considered in the fair\nvalue determination.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nmethodology for compliance\nwith U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. We\ninvolved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in developing an\nindependent fair value\nestimate for a selection of\ncertain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis,\nbased on independently\ndeveloped valuation models and\nassumptions, as applicable,\nusing market data sources we\ndetermined to be relevant and\nreliable, and compared our\nindependent expectation to the\nCompany\u2019s fair value\nmeasurements.\n\nAssessment of the allowance\nfor credit losses collectively\nevaluated for impairment\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 15\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses\nrelated to loans and unfunded\nlending commitments\ncollectively evaluated for\nimpairment (the collective\nACLL) was $18.3 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The\nexpected credit losses for the\nquantitative component of the\ncollective ACLL is the product\nof multiplying the probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) for consumer and\ncorporate loans. For consumer\ncredit cards, the Company uses\nthe payment rate approach over\nthe life of the loan, which\nleverages payment rate curves,\nto determine the payments that\nshould be applied to liquidate\nthe end-of-period balance in\nthe estimation of EAD. For\nunconditionally cancelable\naccounts, reserves are based\non the expected life of the\nbalance as of the evaluation\ndate and do not include any\nundrawn commitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable.\nThe Company\u2019s models utilize a\nsingle forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast and\nmacroeconomic assumptions over\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast periods. Reasonable\nand supportable forecast\nperiods vary by product. For\nconsumer loan models, the\nCompany uses a 13-quarter\nreasonable and supportable\nperiod and reverts to\nhistorical loss experience\nthereafter. For corporate loan\nmodels, the Company uses a\nnine-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period followed by\na three-quarter transition to\nhistorical loss experience.\nAdditionally, for consumer\nloans, these models consider\nleading credit indicators\nincluding loan delinquencies,\nas well as economic factors.\nFor corporate loans, these\nmodels consider the credit\nquality as measured by risk\nratings and economic factors.\nThe qualitative component\nconsiders idiosyncratic events\nand the uncertainty of\nforward-looking economic\nscenarios.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the collective ACLL as a\ncritical audit matter. The\nassessment involved\nsignificant measurement\nuncertainty requiring complex\n                              135                               \nauditor judgment, and\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge as well as\nexperience in the industry.\nThis assessment encompassed\nthe evaluation of the various\ncomponents of the collective\nACLL methodology, including\nthe methods and models used to\nestimate the PD, LGD, and EAD\nand certain key assumptions\nand inputs for the Company\u2019s\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Key assumptions\nand inputs for consumer loans\nincluded loan delinquencies,\ncertain credit indicators,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast periods, expected\nlife as well as economic\nfactors, including\nunemployment rates, gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and\nhousing prices, which are\nconsidered in the model. For\ncorporate loans, key\nassumptions and inputs\nincluded risk ratings,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecasts, credit conversion\nfactor for unfunded lending\ncommitments, and economic\nfactors, including GDP and\nunemployment rates considered\nin the model. Key assumptions\nand inputs for the qualitative\ncomponent for both consumer\nand corporate loan portfolios\nincluded the likelihood and\nseverity of a downside\nscenario and consideration of\nuncertainties due to\nidiosyncratic events as a\nresult of the COVID-19\npandemic. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance of the PD, LGD,\nand EAD models. In addition,\nauditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the sufficiency of\naudit evidence obtained.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\nmeasurement of the collective\nACLL estimate, including\ncontrols over the:\n\n\u2022 approval of the collective\nACLL methodologies\n\n\u2022 determination of the key\nassumptions and inputs used to\nestimate the quantitative and\nqualitative components of the\ncollective ACLL\n\n\u2022 performance monitoring of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\ncollective ACLL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of\ndata and assumptions that the\nCompany used and considered\nthe relevance and reliability\nof such data and assumptions.\nIn addition, we involved\ncredit risk professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 reviewing the Company\u2019s\ncollective ACLL methodologies\nand key assumptions for\ncompliance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the PD, LGD, and\nEAD models by inspecting the\nmodel documentation to\ndetermine whether the models\nare suitable for their\nintended use\n\n\u2022 evaluating judgments made by\nthe Company relative to the\ndevelopment and performance\nmonitoring testing of the PD,\nLGD, and EAD models by\ncomparing them to relevant\nCompany-specific metrics\n\n\u2022 assessing the economic\nforecast scenarios through\ncomparison to publicly\navailable forecasts\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused to develop certain\neconomic forecast scenarios by\ncomparing them to relevant\nindustry practices\n\n\u2022 testing corporate loan risk\nratings for a selection of\nborrowers by evaluating the\nfinancial performance of the\nborrower, sources of\nrepayment, and any relevant\nguarantees or underlying\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused in determining the\nqualitative components and the\neffect of those components on\nthe collective ACLL compared\nwith relevant credit risk\nfactors and consistency with\ncredit trends.\n\nWe also assessed the\nsufficiency of the audit\nevidence obtained related to\nthe collective ACLL by\nevaluating the:\n\n\u2022 cumulative results of the\naudit procedures\n\n\u2022 qualitative aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting practices\n\n\u2022 potential bias in the\naccounting estimates.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP)\n\nWe have served as the\nCompany\u2019s auditor since 1969.\n\nNew York, New York\n\n(PCAOB ID # 185)\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                 \n                                                                \nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and the\n\u201cCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the\naccounts of Citigroup and its\nsubsidiaries prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The Company\nconsolidates subsidiaries in\nwhich it holds, directly or\nindirectly, more than 50% of\nthe voting rights or where it\nexercises control. Entities in\nwhich the Company holds 20% to\n50% of the voting rights\nand/or has the ability to\nexercise significant\ninfluence, other than\ninvestments of designated\nventure capital subsidiaries\nor investments accounted for\nat fair value under the fair\nvalue option, are accounted\nfor under the equity method,\nand the pro rata share of\ntheir income (loss) is\nincluded in Other revenue .\nIncome from investments in\nless-than-20%-owned companies\nis recognized when dividends\nare received. As discussed in\nmore detail in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements, Citigroup also\nconsolidates entities deemed\nto be variable interest\nentities when Citigroup is\ndetermined to be the primary\nbeneficiary. Gains and losses\non the disposition of\nbranches, subsidiaries,\naffiliates, buildings and\nother investments are included\nin Other revenue . Citibank\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a\ncommercial bank and indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup. Citibank\u2019s\nprincipal offerings include\ninvestment banking, commercial\nbanking, cash management,\ntrade finance and e-commerce;\nprivate banking products and\nservices; consumer finance,\ncredit cards, and mortgage\nlending; and retail banking\nproducts and services.\nVariable Interest Entities\n(VIEs) An entity is a variable\ninterest entity (VIE) if it\nmeets either of the criteria\noutlined in Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 810, Consolidation ,\nwhich are (i) the entity has\nequity that is insufficient to\npermit the entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional subordinated\nfinancial support from other\nparties, or (ii) the entity\nhas equity investors that\ncannot make significant\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s\noperations or that do not\nabsorb their proportionate\nshare of the entity\u2019s expected\nlosses or expected returns.\nThe Company consolidates a VIE\nwhen it has both the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and\na right to receive benefits or\nthe obligation to absorb\nlosses of the entity that\ncould be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE (that\nis, Citi is the primary\nbeneficiary). In addition to\nvariable interests held in\nconsolidated VIEs, the Company\nhas variable interests in\nother\n\nVIEs that are not consolidated\nbecause the Company is not the\nprimary beneficiary. All\nunconsolidated VIEs are\nmonitored by the Company to\nassess whether any events have\noccurred to cause its primary\nbeneficiary status to change.\nAll entities not deemed to be\nVIEs with which the Company\nhas involvement are evaluated\nfor consolidation under other\nsubtopics of ASC 810.See Note\n21 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for more\ndetailed information. Foreign\nCurrency Translation Assets\nand liabilities of Citi\u2019s\nforeign operations are\ntranslated from their\nrespective functional\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars\nusing period-end spot foreign\nexchange rates. The effects of\nthose translation adjustments\nare reported in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(loss) , a component of\nstockholders\u2019 equity, net of\nany related hedge and tax\neffects, until realized upon\nsale or substantial\nliquidation of the foreign\nentity, at which point such\namounts are reclassified into\nearnings. Revenues and\nexpenses of Citi\u2019s foreign\noperations are translated\nmonthly from their respective\nfunctional currencies into\nU.S. dollars at amounts that\napproximate weighted average\nexchange rates. For\ntransactions that are\ndenominated in a currency\nother than the functional\ncurrency, including\ntransactions denominated in\nthe local currencies of\nforeign operations that use\nthe U.S. dollar as their\nfunctional currency, the\neffects of changes in exchange\nrates are primarily included\nin Principal transactions ,\nalong with the related effects\nof any economic hedges.\nInstruments used to hedge\nforeign currency exposures\ninclude foreign currency\nforward, option and swap\ncontracts and, in certain\ninstances, designated issues\nof non-U.S.-dollar debt.\nForeign operations in\ncountries with highly\ninflationary economies\ndesignate the U.S. dollar as\ntheir functional currency,\nwith the effects of changes in\nexchange rates primarily\nincluded in Other revenue .\nInvestment Securities\nInvestments include debt and\nequity securities. Debt\nsecurities include bonds,\nnotes and redeemable preferred\nstocks, as well as certain\nloan-backed and structured\nsecurities that are subject to\nprepayment risk. Equity\nsecurities include common and\nnonredeemable preferred stock.\nDebt Securities \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cheld-to-maturity\u201d (HTM) are\nsecurities that the Company\nhas both the ability and the\nintent to hold until maturity\nand are carried at amortized\ncost. Interest income on such\nsecurities is included in\nInterest revenue . \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d (AFS) are\ncarried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value reported\nin Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) ,\na component of stockholders\u2019\nequity, net of applicable\nincome taxes and hedges.\nInterest income on such\nsecurities is included in\nInterest revenue .\n                              146                               \nEquity Securities \u2022 Marketable equity securities are measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. \u2022\nNon-marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the\nmeasurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment\nrepresents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.\nNon-marketable equity securities under the measurement\nalternative are carried at cost less impairment (if any), plus\nor minus changes resulting from observed prices for orderly\ntransactions for the identical or a similar investment of the\nsame issuer. \u2022 Certain investments that would otherwise have\nbeen accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, since\nthe Company elected to apply fair value accounting. For\ninvestments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity\n(HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS), the accrual of interest\nincome is suspended for investments that are in default or for\nwhich it is likely that future interest payments will not be\nmade as scheduled. Debt securities not measured at fair value\nthrough earnings include securities held in HTM or AFS, and\nequity securities accounted for under the Measurement\nAlternative or equity method and Federal Reserve Bank, Federal\nHome Loan Bank stock and certain exchange seats. These\nsecurities are subject to evaluation for impairment as described\nin Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for HTM\nsecurities and in Note 13 for AFS, Measurement Alternative and\nequity method investments. Realized gains and losses on sales of\ninvestments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific\nidentification basis. The Company uses a number of valuation\ntechniques for investments carried at fair value, which are\ndescribed in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets\ninclude debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a\nreceivable position, residual interests in securitizations and\nphysical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in\nNote 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets\nthat Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair\nvalue option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also\nincluded in Trading account assets . Trading account liabilities\ninclude securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and\nderivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain\nliabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value\n(as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). Other than physical commodities inventory, all\ntrading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair\nvalue. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading\nliabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and\ninclude realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains\nand losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such\ninstruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in\nInterest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading\nliabilities. Physical commodities inventory is carried at the\nlower of cost or market with related losses reported in\nPrincipal transactions , except when included in a hedge\nrelationship. Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities\ninventory are included in Principal transactions . Investments\nin unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum\nand palladium) are accounted for as hybrid instruments\ncontaining a debt host contract and an embedded non-financial\nderivative instrument indexed to the price of the relevant\nprecious metal. The embedded derivative instrument and debt host\ncontract are carried at fair value under the fair value option,\nas described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Derivatives used for trading purposes include\ninterest rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity swap\nagreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial\nand commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset\nand liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement\nexists and the other conditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20,\nBalance Sheet\u2014Offsetting , are met. See Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The Company uses a number of\ntechniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and\nliabilities, which are described in Note 24 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute\na sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and\nare treated as collateralized financing transactions. Such\ntransactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or\nreceived plus accrued interest. As described in Note 25 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to\napply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing\nand lending transactions. Fees received or paid for all\nsecurities borrowing and lending transactions are recorded in\nInterest revenue or Interest expense at the contractually\nspecified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-1, Balance\nSheet\u2014Offsetting: Right of Setoff Conditions , are met,\nsecurities borrowing and lending transactions are presented net\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company monitors the fair\nvalue of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and\nobtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. As described in Note 24 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted\ncash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities\nlending and borrowing transactions. Repurchase and Resale\nAgreements Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell\n(reverse repos) do not constitute a sale (or purchase) of the\nunderlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 25\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has\n                              147                               \nelected to apply fair value accounting to certain of such\ntransactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings.\nAny transactions for which fair value accounting has not been\nelected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received\nplus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has\nelected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all\nrepo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest\nexpense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.\nWhere the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance\nSheet\u2014Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements ,\nare met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The Company\u2019s policy is to take\npossession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase\nagreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities\nsubject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow\ntechnique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo\ntransactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized\ndeferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable\nbalances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan\norigination fees and certain direct origination costs are\ngenerally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over\nthe lives of the related loans. As described in Note 25 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Citi has elected fair value\naccounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest\nincome on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the\ncontractually specified rate. Loans that are held-for-investment\nare classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are\nincluded within the cash flows from investing activities\ncategory in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line\nChange in loans . However, when the initial intent for holding a\nloan has changed from held-for-investment to held-for-sale\n(HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related cash\nflows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing\nactivities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the\nline Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer\nLoans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by the Global Consumer Banking (GCB) businesses and\nCorporate/Other . Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies As\na general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real\nestate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments are\n90days contractually past due. For credit cards and other\nunsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues\ninterest until payments are 180days past due. As a result of OCC\nguidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are\nclassified as non-accrual if the related residential first\nmortgage is 90days or more past due. Also as a result of OCC\nguidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities are\nclassified as non-accrual within 60days of notification that the\nborrower has filed for bankruptcy, with the exception of Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA)-insured loans. Loans that have been\nmodified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial\ndifficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the\nmodification. The policy for returning such modified loans to\naccrual status varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a\nminimum number of payments (ranging from oneto six) is required,\nwhile in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual\nstatus. For regulated bank entities, such modified loans are\nreturned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time\nof, or subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is\nable to meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is current\nand has demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment\nperformance (minimum six monthsof consecutive payments). For\nU.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify\nfor modification (other than for loan modifications made through\nthe CARES Act relief provisions or banking agency guidance for\npandemic-related issues) is that a minimum number of payments\n(typically ranging from oneto three) must be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However,\nre-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such\nas credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer\nloans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the\nloan to be re-aged to current status is that at least\nthreeconsecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent\namount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines,\nthe number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject\nto limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nloans may only be modified under those respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-\nage a modified loan to current. Consumer Charge-Off Policies\nCiti\u2019s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:\n\u2022 Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120days\ncontractually past due. \u2022 Unsecured revolving loans and credit\ncard loans are charged off at 180days contractually past due. \u2022\nLoans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down\nto the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at\n120days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans are\nwritten down to the estimated value of the property, less costs\nto sell, at 180days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-\nsecured loans are charged off no later than 180days\ncontractually past due if a decision has been made not to\nforeclose on the loans. \u2022 Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are\ncharged off within 60days of notification of filing by the\nbankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off policy,\nwhichever occurs earlier.\n                              148                               \n\u2022 Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy, other than FHA-\ninsured loans, are written down to the estimated value of the\nproperty, less costs to sell, within 60days of notification that\nthe borrower has filed for bankruptcy or in accordance with\nCiti\u2019s charge-off policy, whichever is earlier. Corporate Loans\nCorporate loans represent loans and leases managed by\nInstitutional Clients Group ( ICG ). Corporate loans are\nidentified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis\nwhen it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-\nlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full,\nthat the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when\ninterest or principal is 90days past due, except when the loan\nis well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any\ninterest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days past due and charged against current\nearnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only\nto the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash\nreceipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are\nwritten down to the extent that principal is deemed to be\nuncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases,\nwhere repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of\nthe underlying collateral and there are no other available and\nreliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of\ncarrying value or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are\nreturned to accrual status when all contractual principal and\ninterest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there\nis a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance\nwith the contractual terms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and\nconsumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified\nas loans HFS and included in Other assets . The practice of\nCiti\u2019s U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell\nsubstantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime\nmortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the fair\nvalue option is elected at origination, with changes in fair\nvalue recorded in Other revenue . With the exception of those\nloans for which the fair value option has been elected, HFS\nloans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value,\nwith any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other\nrevenue . The related cash flows are classified in the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from\noperating activities category on the line Change in loans held-\nfor-sale . Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL) Commencing January\n1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASC) 326,\nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses , using the methodologies\ndescribed below. For information about Citi\u2019s accounting for\nloan losses prior to January 1, 2020, see \u201cSuperseded Accounting\nPrinciples\u201d below. The current expected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology is based on relevant information about past events,\nincluding historical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the\ncollectability of the reported financial asset balances. If the\nasset\u2019s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, then\nhistorical experience is considered over the remaining life of\nthe assets in the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each\nsubsequent reporting period through Provisions for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in\nhistory, current conditions and forecasts as well as changes in\nasset positions and portfolios. ASC 326 defines the ACL as a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the amortized cost of a\nfinancial asset to present the net amount that management\nexpects to collect on the financial asset over its expected\nlife. All financial assets carried at amortized cost are in the\nscope of ASC 326, while assets measured at fair value are\nexcluded. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor a discussion of impairment on available-for-sale (AFS)\nsecurities. Increases and decreases to the allowances are\nrecorded in Provisions for credit losses . The CECL methodology\nutilizes a lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) measurement\nobjective for the recognition of credit losses for held-for-\ninvestment (HFI) loans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities,\nreceivables and other financial assets measured at amortized\ncost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.\nWithin the life of a loan or other financial asset, the\nmethodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the\nprovision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S.\nGAAP. Estimation of ECLs requires Citi to make assumptions\nregarding the likelihood and severity of credit loss events and\ntheir impact on expected cash flows, which drive the probability\nof default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) models and, where Citi discounts the ECL, using\ndiscounting techniques for certain products. Where the asset\u2019s\nlife extends beyond the R&S forecast period, Citi considers\nhistorical experience over the remaining life of the assets in\nestimating the ACL. Citi uses a multitude of variables in its\nmacroeconomic forecast as part of its calculation of both the\nqualitative and quantitative components of the ACL, including\nboth domestic and international variables for its global\nportfolios and exposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the\nkey macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its\nestimate of its consumer and corporate ACLs. Under the\nquantitative base scenario, Citi\u2019s 4Q21 forecasts are for U.S.\nunemployment to continue to improve as the U.S. continues to\nmove past the peak of the pandemic-related health and economic\ncrisis. The following are the main factors and interpretations\nthat Citi considers when estimating the ACL under the CECL\nmethodology: \u2022 The most important reasons for the change in the\nACL during 2021 were the ACL releases resulting from the\nrecovery from the pandemic. \u2022 CECL reserves are estimated over\nthe contractual term of the financial asset, which is adjusted\nfor expected prepayments. Expected extensions are generally not\nconsidered unless the option to extend the loan cannot be\ncanceled unilaterally by Citi. Modifications are also not\n                              149                               \nconsidered, unless Citi has a reasonable expectation that it\nwill execute a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). \u2022 Credit\nenhancements that are not freestanding (such as those that are\nincluded in the original terms of the contract or those executed\nin conjunction with the lending transaction) are considered loss\nmitigants for purposes of CECL reserve estimation. \u2022 For\nunconditionally cancelable accounts such as credit cards,\nreserves are based on the expected life of the balance as of the\nevaluation date (assuming no further charges) and do not include\nany undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable.\nReserves are included for undrawn commitments for accounts that\nare not unconditionally cancelable (such as letters of credit\nand corporate loan commitments, home equity lines of credit\n(HELOCs), undrawn mortgage loan commitments and financial\nguarantees). \u2022 CECL models are designed to be economically\nsensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts provided by\nCiti\u2019s economic forecasting team (EFT) that are approved by\nsenior management. Analysis is performed and documented to\ndetermine the necessary qualitative management adjustment (QMA)\nto capture forward-looking macroeconomic expectations and model\nuncertainty. \u2022 The portion of the forecast that reflects the\nEFT\u2019s reasonable and supportable (R&S) period indicates the\nmaximum length of time its models can produce a R&S\nmacroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion reflecting\nhistorical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the\nloan to estimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast,\nbusinesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to\nbe appropriate and justifiable. Citi\u2019s ability to forecast\ncredit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period\nis based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a\nreasonable and supportable time window. The R&S period reflects\nthe overall ability to have a reasonable and supportable\nforecast of credit loss based on economic forecasts. \u2022 The loss\nmodels consume all or a portion of the R&S economic forecast and\nthen revert to historical loss experience. The R&S forecast\nperiod for consumer loans is 13 quarters and, in most cases,\nreverts to historically based loss experience either immediately\nor using a straight-line approach thereafter, while the R&S\nperiod for corporate loans is nine quarters with an additional\nstraight-line reversion period of three quarters for ECL\nparameters. \u2022 The ACL incorporates provisions for accrued\ninterest on products that are not subject to a non-accrual and\ntimely write-off policy (e.g., credit cards, etc.). \u2022 The\nreserves for TDRs are calculated using the discounted cash flow\nmethod and considers appropriate macroeconomic forecast data for\nthe exposure type. For TDR loans that are collateral dependent,\nthe ACL is based on the fair value of the collateral. \u2022 Citi\nuses the most recent available information to inform its\nmacroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis\nof the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are\nreviewed for significant changes through year end and changes to\nportfolio positions are reflected in the ACL. \u2022 Reserves are\ncalculated at an appropriately granular level and on a pooled\nbasis where financial assets share risk characteristics. At a\nminimum, reserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product\nand country). Where a financial asset does not share risk\ncharacteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for\ncredit losses individually. Quantitative and Qualitative\nComponents of the ACL The loss likelihood and severity models\nuse both internal and external information and are sensitive to\nforecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the\nquantitative component, Citi uses a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast, complemented by the qualitative\ncomponent that reflects economic uncertainty due to a different\npossible more adverse scenario for estimating the ACL. Estimates\nof these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup\u2019s internal system of\ncredit risk ratings; (ii) historical default and loss data,\nincluding comprehensive internal history and rating agency\ninformation regarding default rates and internal data on the\nseverity of losses in the event of default; and (iii) a R&S\nforecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models for the borrowers\u2019 PD, LGD and\nEAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i)\nstatistically calculated estimates to cover the historical\nfluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the\nhistorical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans\nand the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations\nin the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such as current environmental factors\nand credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled\nexpected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed\nthrough a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things: the uncertainty of forward-\nlooking scenarios based on the likelihood and severity of a\npossible recession; the uncertainty of economic conditions\nrelated to an alternative downside scenario; certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and concentrations; collateral coverage; model\nlimitations; idiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria\nunder banking supervisory guidance for loan loss reserves. The\nqualitative adjustment also reflects the estimated impact of the\npandemic on the economic forecasts and the impact on credit loss\nestimates. The total ACL is composed of the quantitative and\nqualitative components.\n                              150                               \nConsumer Loans For consumer loans, most portfolios including\nNorth America cards, mortgages and personal installment loans\n(PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss forecasting\nmodels. Some smaller international portfolios are covered by\neconometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is\nforecasted. The modeling of all retail products is performed by\nexamining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these drivers\nrelate to exposures with similar credit risk characteristics and\nconsider past events, current conditions and R&S forecasts.\nUnder the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are\ncaptured on an undiscounted basis. Citi incorporates expected\nrecoveries on loans into its reserve estimate, including\nexpected recoveries on assets previously written off. CECL\ndefines the exposure\u2019s expected life as the remaining\ncontractual maturity including any expected prepayments.\nSubsequent changes to the contractual terms that are the result\nof a re-underwriting are not included in the loan\u2019s expected\nCECL life. Citi does not establish reserves for the\nuncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer\nproducts, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are\nsubject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy. As such,\nonly the principal balance is subject to the CECL reserve\nmethodology and interest does not attract a further reserve. FAS\n91-deferred origination costs and fees related to new account\noriginations are amortized within a 12-month period, and an ACL\nis provided for components in the scope of the ASC. Separate\nvaluation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR. Long-\nterm modification programs, and short-term (less than 12 months)\nmodifications that provide concessions (such as interest rate\nreductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty, are reported\nas TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that involve a trial\nperiod are reported as TDRs at the start of the trial period.\nThe ACL for TDRs is determined using a discounted cash flow\n(DCF) approach. When a DCF approach is used, the initial\nallowance for ECLs is calculated as the expected contractual\ncash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest\nrate. DCF techniques are applied only for consumer loans\nclassified as TDR loan exposures. For credit cards, Citi uses\nthe payment rate approach, which leverages payment rate curves,\nto determine the payments that should be applied to liquidate\nthe end-of-period balance (CECL balance) in the estimation of\nEAD. The payment rate approach uses customer payment behavior\n(payment rate) to establish the portion of the CECL balance that\nwill be paid each month. These payment rates are defined as the\npercentage of principal payments received in the respective\nmonth divided by the prior month\u2019s billed principal balance. The\nliquidation (CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is\ndetermined by multiplying the CECL balance by that period\u2019s\nforecasted payment rate. The cumulative sum of these payments\nless the CECL balance produces the balance liquidation curve.\nCiti does not apply a non-accrual policy to credit card\nreceivables; rather, they are subject to full charge-off at 180\ndays past due. As such, the entire customer balance up until\nwrite-off, including accrued interest and fees, will be subject\nto the CECL reserve methodology. Corporate Loans and HTM\nSecurities Citi records allowances for credit losses on all\nfinancial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope\nof CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM\ndebt securities. Discounting techniques are applied for\ncorporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities and non-\naccrual/TDR loan exposures. All cash flows are fully discounted\nto the reporting date. The ACL includes Citi\u2019s estimate of all\ncredit losses expected to be incurred over the estimated full\ncontractual life of the financial asset. The contractual life of\nthe financial asset does not include expected extensions,\nrenewals or modifications, except for instances where the\nCompany reasonably expects to extend the tenor of the financial\nasset pursuant to a future TDR. Where Citi has an unconditional\noption to extend the contractual term, Citi does not consider\nthe potential extension in determining the contractual term;\nhowever, where the borrower has the sole right to exercise the\nextension option without Citi\u2019s approval, Citi does consider the\npotential extension in determining the contractual term. The\ndecrease in credit losses under CECL at the date of adoption on\nJanuary 1, 2020, compared with the prior incurred loss\nmethodology, was largely due to more precise contractual\nmaturities that resulted in shorter remaining tenors, the\nincorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical\nloss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across\nindustries and geographies. The Company primarily bases its ACL\non models that assess the likelihood and severity of credit\nevents and their impact on cash flows under R&S forecasted\neconomic scenarios. Allowances consider the probability of the\nborrower\u2019s default, the loss the Company would incur upon\ndefault and the borrower\u2019s exposure at default. Such models\ndiscount the present value of all future cash flows, using the\nasset\u2019s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a more\nsimplified approach based on historical loss rates to certain\nexposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan exposures in\nthe private bank. The Company considers the risk of nonpayment\nto be zero for U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government-sponsored\nagency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such,\nCiti does not have an ACL for these securities. For all other\nHTM debt securities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and\ndiscounting techniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding\nthe likelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured\nsecurities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the\nunderlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to\nHTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used\nfor corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero\nExpected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero\nexpected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation\nof nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on\nthere being no history of loss and the nature of the\nreceivables.\n                              151                               \nSecured Financing Transactions Most of Citi\u2019s reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities borrowing arrangements and margin loans\nrequire that the borrower continually adjust the amount of the\ncollateral securing Citi\u2019s interest, primarily resulting from\nchanges in the fair value of such collateral. In such\narrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by\nwhich the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of\nthe collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the\ncollateral is equal to or exceeds the asset\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such\nwell-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans\npresented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, credit\nlosses are estimated using the same approach as corporate loans.\nAccrued Interest CECL permits entities to make an accounting\npolicy election not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a\npolicy in place that will result in timely reversal or write-off\nof interest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off\npolicy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest.\nFor HTM debt securities, Citi established a non-accrual policy\nthat results in timely write-off of accrued interest. For\ncorporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy is used, Citi\nhas elected to recognize an ACL on accrued interest receivable.\nThe LGD models for corporate loans include an adjustment for\nestimated accrued interest. Reasonably Expected TDRs For\ncorporate loans, the reasonable expectation of TDR concept\nrequires that the contractual life over which ECLs are estimated\nbe extended when a TDR that results in a tenor extension is\nreasonably expected. Reasonably expected TDRs are included in\nthe life of the asset. A discounting technique or collateral-\ndependent practical expedient is used for non-accrual and TDR\nloan exposures that do not share risk characteristics with other\nloans and are individually assessed. Loans modified in\naccordance with the CARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are\nnot classified as TDRs. Purchased Credit-Deteriorated (PCD)\nAssets ASC 326 requires entities that have acquired financial\nassets (such as loans and HTM securities) with an intent to\nhold, to evaluate whether those assets have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since\norigination. These assets are subject to specialized accounting\nat initial recognition under CECL. Subsequent measurement of PCD\nassets will remain consistent with other purchased or originated\nassets, i.e., non-PCD assets. CECL introduces the notion of PCD\nassets, which replaces purchased credit impaired (PCI)\naccounting under prior U.S. GAAP. CECL requires the estimation\nof credit losses to be performed on a pool basis unless a PCD\nasset does not share characteristics with any pool. If certain\nPCD assets do not meet the conditions for aggregation, those PCD\nassets should be accounted for separately. This determination\nmust be made at the date the PCD asset is purchased. In\nestimating ECLs from day 2 onward, pools can potentially be\nreassembled based upon similar risk characteristics. When PCD\nassets are pooled, Citi determines the amount of the initial ACL\nat the pool level. The amount of the initial ACL for a PCD asset\nrepresents the portion of the total discount at acquisition that\nrelates to credit and is recognized as a \u201cgross-up\u201d of the\npurchase price to arrive at the PCD asset\u2019s (or pool\u2019s)\namortized cost. Any difference between the unpaid principal\nbalance and the amortized cost is considered to be related to\nnon-credit factors and results in a discount or premium, which\nis amortized to interest income over the life of the individual\nasset (or pool). Direct expenses incurred related to the\nacquisition of PCD assets and other assets and liabilities in a\nbusiness combination are expensed as incurred. Subsequent\naccounting for acquired PCD assets is the same as the accounting\nfor originated assets; changes in the allowance are recorded in\nProvisions for credit losses . Consumer Citi does not purchase\nwhole portfolios of PCD assets in its retail businesses.\nHowever, there may be a small portion of a purchased portfolio\nthat is identified as PCD at the purchase date. Interest income\nrecognition does not vary between PCD and non-PCD assets. A\nconsumer financial asset is considered to be more-than-\ninsignificantly credit deteriorated if it is more than 30 days\npast due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi generally\nclassifies wholesale loans and debt securities classified as HTM\nor AFS as PCD when both of the following criteria are met: (i)\nthe purchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the\npurchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or\nissuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated\nAA- and lower obtained at origination from certain\nsecuritization transactions as PCD when there is a significant\ndifference (i.e., 10% or greater) between contractual cash\nflows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected cash flows at the\ndate of recognition. Reserve Estimates and Policies Management\nprovides reserves for an estimate of lifetime ECLs in the funded\nloan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of\nan ACL. These reserves are established in accordance with\nCitigroup\u2019s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi\u2019s Chief Risk\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the\ncredit loss reserves each quarter with risk management and\nfinance representatives for each applicable business area.\nApplicable business areas include those having classifiably\nmanaged portfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are\nassigned (primarily ICG ) and delinquency managed portfolios\n(primarily GCB ) or modified consumer loans, where concessions\nwere granted due to the borrowers\u2019 financial difficulties. The\naforementioned representatives for these business areas present\nrecommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded\nlending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and\nqualitative data discussed below:\n                              152                               \nEstimated Credit Losses in the Delinquency-Managed Portfolios\nfor Performing Exposures In addition, risk management and\nfinance representatives who cover business areas with\ndelinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances\nbased on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies\nand changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends,\nincluding current and future housing prices, unemployment,\nlength of time in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This\nmethodology is applied separately for each product within each\ngeographic region in which these portfolios exist. This\nevaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and\njudgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery\nrates, size and diversity of individual large credits and\nability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing, among\nother things, are all taken into account during this review.\nChanges in these estimates could have a direct impact on the\ncredit costs in any period and could result in a change in the\nallowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments Credit\nloss reserves are recognized on all off-balance sheet\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Corporate\nloan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit\nconversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the\nreporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded\nexposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting\ncommitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees\n(excluding performance guarantees). This reserve is classified\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other liabilities . Changes\nto the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded\nin Provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments .\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or\nwhen the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through\npurchase or origination and retains the right to service the\nloans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair\nvalue, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s MSRs, see Notes 16 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill represents\nthe excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net\ntangible and intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing\nand interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs\nor circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce\nthe fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nUnder ASC Topic 350, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other and upon the\nadoption of ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, the Company has\nan option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is\nnecessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company\ndetermines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no\nfurther testing is necessary. If, however, the Company\ndetermines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the\nCompany must perform the quantitative test. The Company has an\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\nany reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly\nto the quantitative test. The quantitative test requires a\ncomparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to\nits carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the\nreporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related\ngoodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is\nnecessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds\nthe fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount\nequal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. Upon any business disposition,\ngoodwill is allocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed\nbusiness based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed\nbusiness to the fair value of the reporting unit. Additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment testing can be found\nin Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible\nAssets Intangible assets\u2014 including core deposit intangibles,\npresent value of future profits, purchased credit card\nrelationships, credit card contract related intangibles, other\ncustomer relationships and other intangible assets, but\nexcluding MSRs\u2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful\nlives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are subject\nto annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair\nvalue. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an\nimpairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not\nrecoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include, among\nother items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method\ninvestments, interest and fees receivable, lease right-of-use\nassets, premises and equipment (including purchased and\ndeveloped software), repossessed assets and other receivables.\nOther liabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses\nand other payables, lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities\nand reserves for legal claims, taxes, unfunded lending\ncommitments, repositioning reserves and other payables. Other\nReal Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets Real estate or other\nassets received through foreclosure or repossession are\ngenerally reported in Other assets , net of a valuation\nallowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair\nvalue.\n                              153                               \nSecuritizations There are two key accounting determinations that\nmust be made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a\ndetermination as to whether the securitization entity must be\nconsolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of\nfinancial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP.\nIf the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates\nthe VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as discussed in\n\u201cVariable Interest Entities\u201d above). For all other\nsecuritization entities determined not to be VIEs in which\nCitigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party\nhas voting control of the entity, giving consideration to\nremoval and liquidation rights in certain partnership\nstructures. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup\nare consolidated. Interests in the securitized and sold assets\nmay be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-\nonly strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and\nservicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company\nretains a seller\u2019s interest in the credit card receivables\ntransferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In\nthe case of consolidated securitization entities, including the\ncredit card trusts, these retained interests are not reported on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain\non the balance sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans\nsold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup\nare U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in\nnon-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified\nas Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included\nin Intangible assets on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDebt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for\nat amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to\nreport the debt instruments, including certain structured notes,\nat fair value, or the debt is in a fair value hedging\nrelationship. Transfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of\nfinancial assets to be considered a sale: (i) the assets must be\nlegally isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other\nreceivership, (ii) the purchaser must have the right to pledge\nor sell the assets transferred (or, if the purchaser is an\nentity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization and\nasset-backed financing activities through the issuance of\nbeneficial interests and that entity is constrained from\npledging the assets it receives, each beneficial interest holder\nmust have the right to sell or pledge their beneficial\ninterests) and (iii) the Company may not have an option or\nobligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements\nare met, the assets are removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the\ntransfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets\nremain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds\nare recognized as the Company\u2019s liability. A legal opinion on a\nsale generally is obtained for complex transactions or where the\nCompany has continuing involvement with assets transferred or\nwith the securitization entity. For a transfer to be eligible\nfor sale accounting, that opinion must state that the asset\ntransfer would be considered a sale and that the assets\ntransferred would not be consolidated with the Company\u2019s other\nassets in the event of the Company\u2019s insolvency. For a transfer\nof a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale, the\nportion transferred must meet the definition of a participating\ninterest. A participating interest must represent a pro rata\nownership in an entire financial asset; all cash flows must be\ndivided proportionately, with the same priority of payment; no\nparticipating interest in the transferred asset may be\nsubordinated to the interest of another participating interest\nholder; and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange\nthe entire financial asset unless all participating interest\nholders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is accounted for as a\nsecured borrowing. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further discussion. Risk Management\nActivities\u2014Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The Company\nmanages its exposures to market movements outside of its trading\nactivities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either\ndirectly or through the use of derivative financial products,\nincluding interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, purchased\noptions and commodities, as well as foreign-exchange contracts.\nThese end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in Trading\naccount assets and Trading account liabilities . See Note 22 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion\nof the Company\u2019s hedging and derivative activities. Instrument-\nSpecific Credit Risk Citi presents separately in AOCI the\nportion of the total change in the fair value of a liability\nresulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk,\nwhen the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair\nvalue in accordance with the fair value option for financial\ninstruments. Accordingly, the change in fair value of\nliabilities for which the fair value option was elected, related\nto changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads, is presented in\nAOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense\nincludes current service costs of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current\nbasis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other\nemployee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and\ncosts of other employee benefits. For its most significant\npension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans),\nCitigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets\nand periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The\neffect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and\nassets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly\nbasis is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) and periodic plan expense. All other plans (All Other\nPlans) are remeasured annually.See Note 8 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                              154                               \nStock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense related to stock and option awards over the requisite\nservice period, generally based on the instruments\u2019 grant-date\nfair value, reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur.\nCompensation cost related to awards granted to employees who\nmeet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-\neligible employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant\ndate, in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive\ncompensation. Certain stock awards with performance conditions\nor certain clawback provisions are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which the associated compensation\nexpense fluctuates with changes in Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are\ncomplex and may be subject to different interpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In\nestablishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company\nmust make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws.\nThe Company must also make estimates about when in the future\ncertain items will affect taxable income in the various tax\njurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and\nadjudication by the court systems of the various tax\njurisdictions, or may be settled with the taxing authority upon\nexamination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties\non income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in financial statements or tax returns,\nbased upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are\nrecognized subject to management\u2019s judgment about whether\nrealization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes ,\nsets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate\nlevel of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions.\nThis interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax\nbenefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to\nbe sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be\nthe highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be\nrealized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to\nenhance transparency of an entity\u2019s tax reserves. See Note 9 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description\nof the Company\u2019s tax provision and related income tax assets and\nliabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal\nTransactions Commissions and fees revenues are recognized in\nincome when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in\nincome typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal\ntransactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date\nbasis.See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a\ndescription of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies for\nCommissions and fees , and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for details of Principal transactions revenue.\nEarnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after\ndeducting preferred stock dividends. The Company has granted\nrestricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that\nare considered to be participating securities, which are akin to\na second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of\nCitigroup\u2019s earnings is allocated to those participating\nsecurities in the EPS calculation. Basic earnings per share is\ncomputed by dividing income available to common stockholders\nafter the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to\nthe participating securities by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per\nshare reflects the potential dilution that could occur if\nsecurities or other contracts to issue common stock were\nexercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the\nweighted average dilutive effect of the Company\u2019s stock options\nand warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation\nof earnings to the participating securities. Anti-dilutive\noptions and warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations.\nUse of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the\nrelated Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such\nestimates are used in connection with certain fair value\nmeasurements. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further discussions on estimates used in the\ndetermination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant\nin determining the amounts of other-than-temporary impairments,\nimpairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions\nfor probable losses that may arise from credit-related exposures\nand probable and estimable losses related to litigation and\nregulatory proceedings, and income taxes. While management makes\nits best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from\nthose estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as\nthose amounts included in Cash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk\nmanagement activities are classified in the same category as the\nrelated assets and liabilities. Related Party Transactions The\nCompany has related party transactions with certain of its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are\nprimarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts,\ncollateralized financing transactions, margin accounts,\nderivative transactions, charges for operational support and the\nborrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the\nordinary course of business.\n                              155                               \nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for Deposit Insurance Expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi changed its presentation\nof accounting for deposit insurance costs paid to the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and similar foreign\nregulators. These costs were previously presented within\nInterest expense and, as a result of this change, are now\npresented within Other operating expenses . Citi concluded that\nthis presentation was preferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances, as it\nbetter reflected the nature of these deposit insurance costs in\nthat these costs do not directly represent interest payments to\ncreditors, but are similar in nature to other payments to\nregulatory agencies that are accounted for as operating\nexpenses. This change in income statement presentation\nrepresents a \u201cchange in accounting principle\u201d under ASC Topic\n250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , with\nretrospective application to the earliest period presented. This\nchange in accounting principle resulted in a reclassification of\n$ 1,207million, $ 1,203million and $ 781million of deposit\ninsurance expenses from Interest expense to Other operating\nexpenses , for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. This change had no impact on Citi\u2019s net income or\nthe total deposit insurance expense incurred by Citi. Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses Overview In June 2016,\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.\n2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326). The\nASU introduced a new credit loss methodology, the CECL\nmethodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses\nwhile also providing additional disclosure about credit risk.\nCiti adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed\nbelow, resulted in an increase in Citi\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of\ndeferred income taxes, at January 1, 2020. The CECL methodology\nutilizes a lifetime \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit losses for loans, HTM debt\nsecurities, receivables and other financial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or\nacquired. The ACL is adjusted each period for changes in\nlifetime expected credit losses. The CECL methodology represents\na significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior\nmultiple existing impairment methods, which generally required\nthat a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the\nlife cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology\ngenerally results in the earlier recognition of the provision\nfor credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than\ncost that Citi intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not\nbe required to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes\nin credit risk. January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact\nThe CECL methodology\u2019s impact on expected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s view of the current state of the\neconomy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and quality of\nCiti\u2019s portfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption,\nbased on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at\nthat time, the aggregate impact to Citi was an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1billion after-\ntax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $ 1.0billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$ 4.9billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi\u2019s\nconsumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit\ncard receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL\nlifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of\napproximately 23months) compared to shorter estimated tenors\nunder the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately 14months), net of recoveries; and (ii)\na release of $ 0.8billion of reserves primarily related to\nCiti\u2019s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining\ntenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. Under the CECL\nmethodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists of\nquantitative and qualitative components. Citi\u2019s quantitative\ncomponent of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and\nutilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast and\ndiscounts inputs for the corporate classifiably managed\nportfolios, complemented by the qualitative component described\nbelow, in estimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs\nfor the corporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable\nand supportable forecast periods vary by product. For example,\nCiti\u2019s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period and revert to historical loss experience\nthereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter\nreasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter\ngraduated transition to historical loss experience. The\nqualitative management adjustment component includes, among\nother things, management adjustments to reflect economic\nuncertainty based on the likelihood and severity of downside\nscenarios and certain portfolio characteristics not captured in\nthe quantitative component, such as concentrations, collateral\ncoverage, model limitations, idiosyncratic events and other\nfactors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL.\nThe qualitative management adjustment component also includes\nmanagement adjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates.\nAccounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection\nCosts During the second quarter of 2020, Citi changed its\naccounting for variable post-charge-off third-party collection\ncosts, whereby these costs were accounted for as an increase in\nexpenses as incurred rather than a reduction in expected credit\nrecoveries. Citi concluded that such a change in the method of\naccounting is preferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances as it better\n                              156                               \nreflects the nature of these collection costs. That is, these\ncosts do not represent reduced payments from borrowers and are\nsimilar to Citi\u2019s other executory third-party vendor contracts\nthat are accounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a\nresult of this change, Citi had a consumer ACL release of $\n426million in the second quarter of 2020 for its U.S. cards\nportfolios and $ 122million in the third quarter of 2020 for its\ninternational portfolios. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi\nrevised the second quarter of 2020 accounting conclusion from a\n\u201cchange in accounting estimate effected by a change in\naccounting principle\u201d to a \u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d\nwhich required an adjustment to opening retained earnings rather\nthan net income, with retrospective application to the earliest\nperiod presented. Citi considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250,\nAccounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic 270,\nInterim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ;\nand ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively\nApplied Due to Immateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior\nYear Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current\nYear Financial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of\nthe revisions were not material to any previously reported\nquarterly or annual period. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and\nquarterly results were revised to reflect this change as if it\nwere effective as of January 1, 2020 (impacts to 2018 and 2019\nwere de minimis). Accordingly, Citi recorded an increase to its\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330million\nand a decrease of $ 443million to its ACL. Further, Citi\nrecorded a decrease of $ 18million to its provisions for credit\nlosses on loans in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of\n$ 339million and $ 122million to its provisions for credit\nlosses on loans in the second and third quarters of 2020,\nrespectively. In addition, Citi`s operating expenses increased\nby $ 49million and $ 45million, with a corresponding decrease in\nnet credit losses, in the first and second quarters of 2020,\nrespectively. As a result of these changes, Citi\u2019s net income\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 330million lower, or\n$ 0.16per share lower, than under the previous presentation as a\nchange in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting\nprinciple. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation\nof the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ,\nwhich provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in\naccounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate\nreform on financial reporting. Specifically, the guidance\npermits an entity, when certain criteria are met, to consider\namendments to contracts made to comply with reference rate\nreform to meet the definition of a modification under U.S. GAAP.\nIt further allows hedge accounting to be maintained and permits\na one-time transfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity\nsecurities. The expedients and exceptions provided by the\namendments are permitted to be adopted any time through December\n31, 2022 and do not apply to contract modifications made and\nhedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December\n31, 2022, except for certain optional expedients elected for\ncertain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022.\nThe ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective\napplication and did not impact financial results in 2020. In\nJanuary 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of\nthe initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020\nincludes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate\nthat is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest\nrate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that\nis modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cdiscounting transition\u201d). The amendments do\nnot apply to contract modifications made after December 31,\n2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31,\n2022 and existing hedging relationships evaluated for\neffectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for\nhedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022 that\napply certain optional expedients in which the accounting\neffects are recorded through the end of the hedging\nrelationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi on a full\nretrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial\nresults in 2020. Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which increases the\ntransparency and comparability of accounting for lease\ntransactions. The ASU requires lessees to recognize liabilities\nfor operating leases and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets\non the balance sheet. The ASU also requires quantitative and\nqualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing\narrangements. Lessee accounting for finance leases, as well as\nlessor accounting, is largely unchanged. Effective January 1,\n2019, Citi prospectively adopted the provisions of the ASU. At\nadoption, Citi recognized a lease liability and a corresponding\nROU asset of approximately $ 4.4billion on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet related to its future lease payments as a lessee\nunder operating leases. In addition, Citi recorded a $\n151million increase in Retained earnings for the cumulative\neffect of recognizing previously deferred gains on\nsale/leaseback transactions. Adoption of the ASU did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income. See\nNotes 14 and 26 for additional details. Citi has elected not to\nseparate lease and non-lease components in its lease contracts\nand accounts for them as a single lease component. Citi has also\nelected not to record an ROU asset for short-term leases that\nhave a term of 12 months or less and do not contain purchase\noptions that Citi is reasonably certain to exercise. The cost of\nshort-term leases is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In\naddition, Citi applies the portfolio approach to account for\ncertain equipment leases with nearly identical contractual\nterms. Lessee Accounting Operating lease ROU assets and lease\nliabilities are included in Other assets and Other liabilities ,\nrespectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease\nassets and liabilities are included in Other assets and Long-\nterm debt , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCiti uses its incremental borrowing rate, factoring in the lease\nterm, to\n                              157                               \ndetermine the lease liability, which is measured at the present\nvalue of future lease payments. The ROU asset is initially\nmeasured at the amount of the lease liability plus any prepaid\nrent and remaining initial direct costs, less any remaining\nlease incentives and accrued rent. The ROU asset is subject to\nimpairment, during the lease term, in a manner consistent with\nthe impairment of long-lived assets. The lease terms include\nperiods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease\ndepending on whether Citi is reasonably certain to exercise such\noptions. Lessor Accounting Lessor accounting is largely\nunchanged under the ASU. Citi acts as a lessor for power,\nrailcar, shipping and aircraft assets, where Citi has executed\noperating, direct financing and leveraged leasing arrangements.\nIn a direct financing or a leveraged lease, Citi derecognizes\nthe leased asset and records a lease financing receivable at\nlease commencement in Loans . Upon lease termination, Citi may\nobtain control of the asset, which is then recorded in Other\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and any remaining\nreceivable for the asset\u2019s residual value is derecognized. Under\nthe ASU, leveraged lease accounting is grandfathered and may\ncontinue to be applied until the leveraged lease is terminated\nor modified. Upon modification, the lease must be classified as\nan operating, direct finance or sales-type lease in accordance\nwith the ASU. Separately, as part of managing its real estate\nfootprint, Citi subleases excess real estate space via operating\nlease arrangements. FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Long-Duration\nInsurance Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2018-12, Financial Services\u2014Insurance: Targeted Improvements to\nthe Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures\nfor long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits\nand prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for\nlong-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves\nthe accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii)\nsimplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and\n(iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily\nin Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as\ntraditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity\ncontracts that will be impacted by the requirements of ASU\n2018-12. The effective date of ASU 2018-12 was deferred for all\ninsurance entities by ASU 2019-09, Finance Services\u2014Insurance:\nEffective Date (issued in October 2019) and by ASU 2020-11,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance: Effective Date and Early\nApplication (issued in November 2020). Citi plans to adopt the\ntargeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of the standard on its insurance\nsubsidiaries. Citi does not expect a material impact to its\nresults of operations as a result of adopting the standard.\nSUPERSEDED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The following accounting\nprinciple was in effect for 2019 since ASU No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326) became\neffective beginning on January 1, 2020. Allowance for Credit\nLosses The allowance for credit losses on loans represents\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in\nthe portfolio, including probable losses related to large\nindividually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings. Additions to the allowance are made through the\nProvision for credit losses on loans . Loan losses are deducted\nfrom the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added. Assets\nreceived in exchange for loan claims in a restructuring are\ninitially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss\nreflected as a recovery or charge-off in the provision.\n                              158                               \n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,\nSIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND\nOTHER BUSINESS EXITS\n\nSummary of Discontinued\nOperations\n\nThe Company\u2019s results from\nDiscontinued operations\nconsisted of residual\nactivities related to the\nsales of the Egg Banking plc\ncredit card business in 2011\nand the German retail banking\nbusiness in 2008. All\nDiscontinued operations\nresults are recorded within\nCorporate/Other.\nThe following table summarizes\nfinancial information for all\nDiscontinued operations :\n                                                                \n  In millions of dollars            2021       2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total revenues, net of         $     \u2014    $     \u2014    $     \u2014  \n  interest expense                                              \n  Income (loss) from                                            \n  discontinued                   $     7    $   -20    $   -31  \n  operations                                                    \n  Benefit for income taxes             \u2014          \u2014        -27  \n  Income (loss) from                                            \n  discontinued                   $     7    $   -20    $    -4  \n  operations, net of taxes                                      \n                                                                \nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor any period presented.\n\nSignificant Disposals\n\nThe following transactions\nwere identified as significant\ndisposals that are recorded\nwithin the GCB segment,\nincluding the assets and\nliabilities that were\nreclassified to held-for-sale\nwithin Other assets and Other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and\nthe Income (loss) before taxes\n(benefits) related to each\nbusiness.\n\nAgreement to Sell Australia\nConsumer Banking Business\n\nOn August 9, 2021, Citi\nentered into an agreement to\nsell its Australia consumer\nbanking business, which is\npart of Asia GCB . The sale,\nwhich is subject to regulatory\napprovals and other closing\nconditions, is expected to\nclose in the first half of\n2022.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES;\nADMINISTRATION AND OTHER\nFIDUCIARY FEES\n\nCommissions and Fees The\nprimary components of\nCommissions and fees revenue\nare investment banking fees,\nbrokerage commissions, credit\ncard and bank card income and\ndeposit-related fees.\nInvestment banking fees are\nsubstantially composed of\nunderwriting and advisory\nrevenues. Such fees are\nrecognized at the point in\ntime when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of\na contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically\nat the closing of a\ntransaction. Reimbursed\nexpenses related to these\ntransactions are recorded as\nrevenue and are included\nwithin investment banking\nfees. In certain instances for\nadvisory contracts, Citi will\nreceive amounts in advance of\nthe deal\u2019s closing. In these\ninstances, the amounts\nreceived will be recognized as\na liability and not recognized\nin revenue until the\ntransaction closes. For the\nperiods presented, the\ncontract liability amount was\nnegligible. Out-of-pocket\nexpenses associated with\nunderwriting activity are\ndeferred and recognized at the\ntime the related revenue is\nrecognized, while out-of-\npocket expenses associated\nwith advisory arrangements are\nexpensed as incurred. In\ngeneral, expenses incurred\nrelated to investment banking\ntransactions, whether\nconsummated or not, are\nrecorded in Other operating\nexpenses . The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as\nprincipal in the majority of\nthese transactions and\ntherefore presents expenses\ngross within Other operating\nexpenses . Brokerage\ncommissions primarily include\ncommissions and fees from the\nfollowing: executing\ntransactions for clients on\nexchanges and over-the-counter\nmarkets; sales of mutual funds\nand other annuity products;\nand assisting clients in\nclearing transactions,\nproviding brokerage services\nand other such activities.\nBrokerage commissions are\nrecognized in Commissions and\nfees at the point in time the\nassociated service is\nfulfilled, generally on the\ntrade execution date. Sales of\ncertain investment products\ninclude a portion of variable\nconsideration associated with\nthe underlying product. In\nthese instances, a portion of\nthe revenue associated with\nthe sale of the product is not\nrecognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes fixed.\nThe Company recognized $\n639million, $ 495million and $\n485million of revenue related\nto such variable consideration\nfor the years ended December\n31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. These amounts\nprimarily relate to\nperformance obligations\nsatisfied in prior periods.\nCredit card and bank card\nincome is primarily composed\nof interchange fees, which are\nearned by card issuers based\non purchase sales, and certain\ncard fees, including annual\nfees. Costs related to\ncustomer reward programs and\ncertain payments to partners\n(primarily based on program\nsales, profitability and\ncustomer acquisitions) are\nrecorded as a reduction of\ncredit card and bank card\nincome. Citi\u2019s credit card\nprograms have certain partner\nsharing agreements that vary\nby partner. These partner\nsharing agreements are subject\nto contractually based\nperformance thresholds that,\nif met, would require Citi to\nmake ongoing payments to the\npartner. The threshold is\nbased on the profitability of\na program and is\n\ngenerally calculated based on\npredefined program revenues\nless predefined program\nexpenses. In most of Citi\u2019s\npartner sharing agreements,\nprogram expenses include net\ncredit losses and, to the\nextent that the increase in\nnet credit losses reduces\nCiti\u2019s liability for the\npartners\u2019 share for a given\nprogram year, it would\ngenerally result in lower\npayments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa.\nFurther, in some instances,\nother partner payments are\nbased on program sales and new\naccount acquisitions.\nInterchange revenues are\nrecognized as earned on a\ndaily basis when Citi\u2019s\nperformance obligation to\ntransmit funds to the payment\nnetworks has been satisfied.\nAnnual card fees, net of\norigination costs, are\ndeferred and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over a\n12-month period. Costs related\nto card reward programs are\nrecognized when the rewards\nare earned by the cardholders.\nPayments to partners are\nrecognized when incurred.\nDeposit-related fees consist\nof service charges on deposit\naccounts and fees earned from\nperforming cash management\nactivities and other deposit\naccount services. Such fees\nare recognized in the period\nin which the related service\nis provided. Transactional\nservice fees primarily consist\nof fees charged for processing\nservices such as cash\nmanagement, global payments,\nclearing, international funds\ntransfer and other trade\nservices. Such fees are\nrecognized as/when the\nassociated service is\nsatisfied, which normally\noccurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by\nthe customer and provided by\nCiti. Insurance distribution\nrevenue consists of\ncommissions earned from third-\nparty insurance companies for\nmarketing and selling\ninsurance policies on behalf\nof such entities. Such\ncommissions are recognized in\nCommissions and fees at the\npoint in time the associated\nservice is fulfilled,\ngenerally when the insurance\npolicy is sold to the\npolicyholder. Sales of certain\ninsurance products include a\nportion of variable\nconsideration associated with\nthe underlying product. In\nthese instances, a portion of\nthe revenue associated with\nthe sale of the policy is not\nrecognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes\ndeterminable. The Company\nrecognized $ 260million, $\n290million and $ 322million of\nrevenue related to such\nvariable consideration for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThese amounts primarily relate\nto performance obligations\nsatisfied in prior periods.\nInsurance premiums consist of\npremium income from insurance\npolicies that Citi has\nunderwritten and sold to\npolicyholders.\n                              163                               \nThe following table presents Commissions and fees revenue:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Citi\u2019s consumer credit card programs have certain partner-\nsharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 107million, $ 100million and $\n127million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

Amounts reported\nin Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance\nprimarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs\nand certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance\npremiums and loan servicing fees.\n                              164                               \nAdministration and Other Fiduciary Fees Administration and other\nfiduciary fees revenue is primarily composed of custody fees and\nfiduciary fees. The custody product is composed of numerous\nservices related to the administration, safekeeping and\nreporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The\nservices offered to clients include trade settlement,\nsafekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,\nrecord-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management.\nThese services are provided for a wide range of securities,\nincluding but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate\nbonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market\ninstruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative\ninstruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious\nmetals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated\npromised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the\npoint in time the service is requested by the customer and\nprovided by Citi. Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and\ninvestment management services. As an escrow agent, Citi\nreceives, safe-keeps, services and manages clients\u2019 escrowed\nassets, such as cash, securities, property (including\nintellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi\nperforms its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the assets\nduring the specified time period agreed upon by all parties and\ntherefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration.\nInvestment management services consist of managing assets on\nbehalf of Citi\u2019s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from\nthese services primarily consists of asset-based fees for\nadvisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the\nclient\u2019s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is\nfixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party\nadvisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as principal in the majority of these\ntransactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third\nparties gross within Other operating expenses .

INCENTIVE PLANS\nDiscretionary Annual Incentive\nAwards Citigroup grants\nimmediate cash bonus payments\nand various forms of immediate\nand deferred awards as part of\nits discretionary annual\nincentive award program\ninvolving a large segment of\nCitigroup\u2019s employees\nworldwide. Discretionary\nannual incentive awards are\ngenerally awarded in the first\nquarter of the year based on\nthe previous year\u2019s\nperformance. Awards valued at\nless than U.S. $ 100,000(or\nthe local currency equivalent)\nare generally paid entirely in\nthe form of an immediate cash\nbonus. Pursuant to Citigroup\npolicy and/or regulatory\nrequirements, certain\nemployees are subject to\nmandatory deferrals of\nincentive pay and generally\nreceive 25%\u2013 60% of their\nawards in the form of deferred\nstock and deferred cash stock\nunits. Discretionary annual\nincentive awards to many\nemployees in the EU are\nsubject to deferral\nrequirements regardless of the\ntotal award value, with at\nleast 50% of the immediate\nincentive delivered in the\nform of a stock payment award\nsubject to a restriction on\nsale or transfer (generally,\nfor 12months). Subject to\ncertain exceptions\n(principally, for retirement-\neligible employees),\ncontinuous employment within\nCitigroup is required to vest\nin deferred annual incentive\nawards. Post employment\nvesting by retirement-eligible\nemployees and participants who\nmeet other conditions is\ngenerally conditioned upon\ntheir refraining from\ncompetition with Citigroup\nduring the remaining vesting\nperiod, unless the employment\nrelationship has been\nterminated by Citigroup under\ncertain conditions. Generally,\nthe deferred awards vest in\nequal annual installments over\nthree- or four-yearperiods.\nVested CAP awards are\ndelivered in shares of common\nstock. Deferred cash awards\nare payable in cash and,\nexcept as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, earn a fixed\nnotional rate of interest that\nis paid only if and when the\nunderlying principal award\namount vests. Deferred cash\nstock unit awards are payable\nin cash at the vesting value\nof the underlying stock.\nGenerally, in the EU, vested\nCAP shares are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer after vesting, and\nvested deferred cash awards\nand deferred cash stock units\nare subject to hold back\n(generally, for 6or 12months\nbased on the award type).\nUnvested CAP, deferred cash\nstock units and deferred cash\nawards may be subject to\nperformance conditions and are\nsubject to one or more\ncancellation and clawback\nprovisions that apply in\ncertain circumstances,\nincluding gross misconduct.\n\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock\nAwards\nA summary of the status of\nunvested stock awards granted\nas discretionary annual\nincentive or sign-on and\nreplacement awards is\npresented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Unvested\u00a0stock\u00a0awards           Shares       value per share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unvested at December        28,226,292    $            69.25  \n  31, 2020                                                      \n  Granted(1)                  17,535,978                 62.10  \n  Canceled                    -1,453,029                 67.01  \n  Vested(2)                  -12,664,557                 67.17  \n  Unvested at December        31,644,684    $            66.22  \n  31, 2021                                                      \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares granted\nduring 2020 and 2019 was $\n76.68and $ 61.78,\nrespectively.\n(2) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares vesting\nduring 2021 was approximately\n$ 64.23per share on the\nvesting date, compared to $\n67.17on the grant date.\nTotal unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to\nunvested stock awards was $\n654million at December 31,\n2021. The cost is expected to\nbe recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 1.6years.\n                              167                               \nPerformance Share Units\nExecutive officers were\nawarded performance share\nunits (PSUs) every February\nfrom 2018 to 2021, for\nperformance in the year prior\nto the award date based on two\nperformance metrics. For PSUs\nawarded in 2018, 2019 and\n2020, those metrics were\nreturn on tangible common\nequity and earnings per share.\nFor PSUs awards in 2021, the\nmetrics were return on\ntangible common equity and\ntangible book value per share.\nIn each year, the metrics were\nequally weighted. For all\naward years, if the total\nshareholder return is negative\nover the three-yearperformance\nperiod, executives may earn no\nmore than 100% of the target\nPSUs, regardless of the extent\nto which Citigroup outperforms\nagainst performance goals\nand/or peer firms. The number\nof PSUs ultimately earned\ncould vary from zero, if\nperformance goals are not met,\nto as much as 150% of target,\nif performance goals are\nmeaningfully exceeded. For all\naward years, the value of each\nPSU is equal to the value of\noneshare of Citi common stock.\nDividend equivalents are\naccrued and paid on the number\nof earned PSUs after the end\nof the performance period.\nPSUs are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s stock\nprice and the attainment of\nthe specified performance\ngoals for each award, until\nthe award is settled solely in\ncash after the end of the\nperformance period. The value\nof the award, subject to the\nperformance goals and taking\ninto account any mandatory\nequitable adjustments as per\nthe terms of the award\nagreement, is estimated using\na simulation model that\nincorporates multiple\nvaluation assumptions,\nincluding the probability of\nachieving the specified\nperformance goals of each\naward. The risk-free rate used\nin the model is based on the\napplicable U.S. Treasury yield\ncurve.

Participation in these\nplans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for\ndiscretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms of variable\ncompensation include monthly commissions paid to financial\nadvisors and mortgage loan officers. Summary Except for awards\nsubject to variable accounting, the total expense recognized for\nstock awards represents the grant date fair value of such\nawards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income\nratably over the vesting period, other than for awards to\nretirement-eligible employees and immediately vested awards.\nWhenever awards are made or are expected to be made to\nretirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is\naccelerated based on when the applicable conditions to\nretirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is\nretirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at\nthe grant date, Citi recognizes the expense each year equal to\nthe grant date fair value of the awards that it estimates will\nbe granted in the following year. Recipients of Citigroup stock\nawards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares\nare delivered upon vesting or exercise, or after the expiration\nof applicable required holding periods. Recipients of deferred\nstock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards, however, may,\nexcept as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, be\nentitled to receive or accrue dividends or dividend-equivalent\npayments during the vesting period. Recipients of stock payment\nawards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their award\nduring the sale-restriction period. Once a stock award vests,\nthe shares delivered to the participant are freely transferable,\nunless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for\na specified period. All equity awards granted since April 19,\n2005 have been made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock\nincentive plans that are administered by the P&C Committee,\nwhich is composed entirely of independent non-employee\ndirectors. At December 31, 2021, approximately 39.0million\nshares of Citigroup common stock were authorized and available\nfor grant under Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the only\nplan from which equity awards are currently granted. The 2019\nStock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the use of\ntreasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards\ngranted under the plans. Treasury shares were used to settle\nvestings from 2018 to 2021, and for the first quarter of 2022,\nexcept where local laws favor newly issued shares. The use of\ntreasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards\ndoes not affect the compensation expense recorded in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income for equity awards.\n                              169                               \nIncentive Compensation Cost\nThe following table shows\ncomponents of compensation\nexpense, relating to certain\nof the incentive compensation\nprograms described above:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0dollars          2021        2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Charges for estimated                                         \n  awards to                   $    807    $    748    $    683  \n  retirement-eligible                                           \n  colleagues                                                    \n  Amortization of deferred                                      \n  cash awards,                                                  \n  deferred cash stock              384         201         355  \n  units and                                                     \n  performance stock units                                       \n  Immediately vested stock                                      \n  award                             99          95          82  \n  expense(1)                                                    \n  Amortization of                                               \n  restricted and deferred          395         420         404  \n  stock awards(2)                                               \n  Other variable incentive         435         627         666  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Total                       $  2,120    $  2,091    $  2,190  \n                                                                \n(1) Represents expense for\nimmediately vested stock\nawards that generally were\nstock payments in lieu of cash\ncompensation.

These plans,\nwhich\n\nare unfunded, provide\nsupplemental defined pension\nbenefits to certain U.S.\nemployees. With the exception\nof certain employees covered\nunder the prior final pay plan\nformula, the benefits under\nthese plans were frozen in\nprior years.

During 2020, the actuarial loss was\nprimarily due to the decline in global discount rates partially\noffset by favorable asset returns.\n(3) U.S. postretirement benefit plans were net of Employer Group\nWaiver Plan subsidies of $ 11million and $ 40million in 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\n(4) Curtailment and settlement gains relate to repositioning and\ndivestiture activities.\n(5) The U.S. qualified pension plan was fully funded under\nspecified Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)\nfunding rules as of January 1, 2022 and no minimum required\nfunding is expected for 2022.\n(6) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n                              172                               \n(7) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\nThe following table shows the change in AOCI related to the\nCompany\u2019s pension, postretirement and post employment plans:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                                               \n  dollars                       2021         2020         2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Beginning of year                                             \n  balance, net of          $  -6,864    $  -6,809    $  -6,257  \n  tax(1)(2)                                                     \n  Actuarial assumptions                                         \n  changes and plan               963       -1,464       -2,300  \n  experience                                                    \n  Net asset gain (loss)                                         \n  due to difference             -148        1,076        1,427  \n  between actual and                                            \n  expected returns                                              \n  Net amortization               280          318          274  \n  Prior service credit            -7          108           -7  \n  (cost)                                                        \n  Curtailment/settleme\u2026           11           -8            1  \n  gain(3)                                                       \n  Foreign exchange               153         -108          -66  \n  impact and other                                              \n  Change in deferred            -240           23          119  \n  taxes, net                                                    \n  Change, net of tax       $   1,012    $     -55    $    -552  \n  End of year balance,     $  -5,852    $  -6,864    $  -6,809  \n  net of tax(1)(2)                                              \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther discussion of net AOCI balance.\n(2) Includes net-of-tax amounts for certain profit-sharing plans\noutside the U.S.\n(3) Curtailment and settlement relate to repositioning and\ndivestiture activities.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate projected benefit\nobligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation\n(ABO) and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented\nfor all defined benefit pension plans with a PBO in excess of\nplan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an\nABO in excess of plan assets as follows:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                                                                \n(1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, only the nonqualified\nplans\u2019 PBO and ABO exceeded plan assets.\nPlan Assumptions The Company utilizes a number of assumptions to\ndetermine plan obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a\ncombination of these assumptions will have an impact on the\nCompany\u2019s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and\n(benefit) expense. Changes in the plans\u2019 funded status resulting\nfrom changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have\na corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) . The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended\nDecember 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end\nPBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear (period). Since Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are measured on a\nquarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to\ncalculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear\u2019s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement\nprocess, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant\nPlans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the\npreceding quarter-end rates (as shown below for the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. pension and postretirement plans).

However, where\ndeveloped corporate bond\nmarkets do not exist, the\ndiscount rates are selected by\nreference to local government\nbond rates with a premium\nadded to reflect the\nadditional risk for corporate\nbonds in certain countries.\nEffective December 31, 2019,\nthe established rounding\nconvention is to the nearest 5\nbps for all countries.\nExpected Return on Assets The\nCompany determines its\nassumptions for the expected\nreturn on assets for its U.S.\npension and postretirement\nplans using a \u201cbuilding block\u201d\napproach, which focuses on\nranges of anticipated rates of\nreturn for each asset class. A\nweighted average range of\nnominal rates is then\ndetermined based on target\nallocations to each asset\nclass. Market performance over\na number of earlier years is\nevaluated covering a wide\nrange of economic conditions\nto determine whether there are\nsound reasons for projecting\nany past trends. The Company\nconsiders the expected return\non assets to be a long-term\nassessment of return\nexpectations and does not\nanticipate changing this\nassumption unless there are\nsignificant changes in\ninvestment strategy or\neconomic conditions. This\ncontrasts with the selection\nof the discount rate and\ncertain other assumptions,\nwhich are reconsidered\nannually (or quarterly for the\nSignificant Plans) in\naccordance with GAAP. The\nexpected return on assets\nreflects the expected annual\nappreciation of the plan\nassets and reduces the\nCompany\u2019s annual pension\nexpense. The expected return\non assets is deducted from the\nsum of service cost, interest\ncost and other components of\npension expense to arrive at\nthe net pension (benefit)\nexpense.\nThe following table shows the expected return on assets used in\ndetermining the Company\u2019s pension expense compared to the actual\nreturn on assets during 2021, 2020 and 2019 for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement plans:\n                                                                \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  (During the                      2021     2020          2019  \n  year)                                                         \n  Expected return                                               \n  on assets                                                     \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement      5.80%/5.60%/5.60\u2026    6.70%         6.70%  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA trust                       1.50     3.00          3.00  \n  Actual return on                                              \n  assets(1)                                                     \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement                   5.14    12.84         15.20  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA trust                       1.52     2.11    1.91to2.76  \n                                                                \n(1) Actual return on assets is presented net of fees.\nSensitivities of Certain Key\nAssumptions\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                           Discount rate                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2021       2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $                35    $    34    $    28  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      -4        -16        -19  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2021       2020       2019  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               -49    $   -52    $   -44  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      25         25         32  \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Qualified Pension\nPlan was frozen in 2008, and\nas a result, most service\ncosts have been eliminated.\nThe pension expense for the\nU.S. Qualified Pension Plan is\ntherefore driven primarily by\ninterest cost rather than by\nservice cost. An increase in\nthe discount rate generally\nincreases pension expense. For\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans that\nare not frozen (in countries\nsuch as Mexico, the U.K. and\nSouth Korea), there is more\nservice cost. The pension\nexpense for the Non-U.S. Plans\nis driven by both service cost\nand interest cost. An increase\nin the discount rate generally\ndecreases pension expense due\nto the greater impact on\nservice cost compared to\ninterest cost. Since the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan was\nfrozen, most of the\nprospective service cost has\nbeen eliminated and the\ngain/loss amortization period\nwas changed to the life\nexpectancy for inactive\nparticipants. As a result,\npension expense for the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan is\ndriven more by interest costs\nthan service costs, and an\nincrease in the discount rate\nwould increase pension\nexpense, while a decrease in\nthe discount rate would\ndecrease pension expense.\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                         Expected return                        \n                               on assets                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2021       2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $              -124    $  -123    $  -123  \n  Non-U.S. plans                     -70        -66        -64  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2021       2020       2019  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               124    $   123    $   123  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      70         66         64  \n                                                                \n                              175                               \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate\nAssumed health care cost trend\nrates were as follows:\n                                                             \n                                              2021     2020  \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  U.S.\u00a0plans                                                 \n  Following year                             6.25%    6.50%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     5.00     5.00  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate is          2027     2027  \n  reached                                                    \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  non-U.S.\u00a0plans (weighted average)                          \n  Following year                             6.92%    6.85%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     6.92     6.85  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate             2022     2021  \n  is reached                                                 \n                                                             \nInterest Crediting Rate\nThe Company has cash balance\nplans and other plans with\npromised interest crediting\nrates.

is to\ninvest in a prudent manner for\nthe exclusive purpose of\nproviding benefits to\nparticipants. The investment\nstrategies are targeted to\nproduce a total return that,\nwhen combined with the\nCompany\u2019s contributions to the\nfunds, will maintain the\nfunds\u2019 ability to meet all\nrequired benefit obligations.\nRisk is controlled through\ndiversification of asset types\nand investments in domestic\nand international equities,\nfixed income securities and\ncash and short-term\ninvestments. The target asset\nallocation in most locations\noutside the U.S. is primarily\nin equity and debt securities.\nThese allocations may vary by\ngeographic region and country\ndepending on the nature of\napplicable obligations and\nvarious other regional\nconsiderations. The wide\nvariation in the actual range\nof plan asset allocations for\nthe funded non-U.S. plans is a\nresult of differing local\nstatutory requirements and\neconomic conditions. For\nexample, in certain countries\nlocal law requires that all\npension plan assets must be\ninvested in fixed income\ninvestments, government funds\nor local-country securities.\nSignificant Concentrations of\nRisk in Plan Assets The assets\nof the Company\u2019s pension plans\nare diversified to limit the\nimpact of any individual\ninvestment. The U.S. qualified\npension plan is diversified\nacross multiple asset classes,\nwith publicly traded fixed\nincome, publicly traded\nequity, hedge funds and real\nestate representing the most\nsignificant asset allocations.\nInvestments in these four\nasset classes are further\ndiversified across funds,\nmanagers, strategies,\nvintages, sectors and\ngeographies, depending on the\nspecific characteristics of\neach asset class.

As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries\nare currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax\nearnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a\nseparate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also,\ndividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are\neffectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides\nincome taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are\nindefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2021, $\n6.5billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was\nindefinitely invested. At the existing tax rates (including\nwithholding taxes), additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs and\nvaluation allowances) of $ 1.8billion would have to be provided\nif such assertions were reversed. Income taxes are not provided\nfor the Company\u2019s \u201csavings bank base year bad debt reserves\u201d\nthat arose before 1988, because under current U.S. tax rules,\nsuch taxes will become payable only to the extent that such\namounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by\nfederal law. At December 31, 2021, the amount of the base year\nreserves totaled approximately $ 358million (subject to a tax of\n$ 75million).\n                              184                               \nDeferred Tax Assets As of\nDecember 31, 2021, Citi had a\nvaluation allowance of $\n4.2billion, composed of\nvaluation allowances of $\n0.8billion on its general\nbasket FTC carry-forwards, $\n1.7billion on its branch\nbasket FTC carry-forwards, $\n1.0billion on its U.S.\nresidual DTA related to its\nnon-U.S. branches, $\n0.6billion on local non-U.S.\nDTAs and $ 0.1billion on state\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. There was a decrease\nof $ 1.0billion from the\nDecember 31, 2020 balance of $\n5.2billion. The amount of\nCiti\u2019s valuation allowances\n(VA) may change in future\nyears. In 2021, Citi\u2019s VA for\ncarry-forward FTCs in its\nbranch basket decreased by $\n0.7billion and the related VA\nfor the U.S. tax effect on\nnon-U.S. branch temporary\ndifferences was unchanged. Of\nthis total branch-related\nchange of $ 0.7billion, $\n0.3billion impacted the tax\nprovision as discussed below.\nThe remainder of the branch\nbasket-related VA decrease of\n$ 0.4billion was primarily due\nto carry-forward expirations.\nThe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and the allocations of\noverall domestic losses (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to the branch basket\nare the main factors in\ndetermining the branch VA. The\nallocated ODL was enhanced by\nsignificant taxable income\ngenerated in the current year.\nIn addition, the global\ninterest rate environment and\nbalance sheet requirements in\nnon-U.S. branches resulted in\na lower relative allocation of\ninterest expense to non-U.S.\nbranches. The combination of\nthe factors enumerated\nresulted in a VA release of $\n0.2billion in Citi\u2019s full-year\neffective tax rate. Citi also\nreleased branch basket VA of $\n0.1billion with respect to\nfuture years, based upon\nCiti\u2019s Operating Plan and\nestimates of future branch\nbasket factors, as outlined\nabove. In Citi\u2019s general\nbasket for FTCs, changes in\nthe forecasted amount of\nincome in U.S. locations\nderived from sources outside\nthe U.S., in addition to tax\nexamination changes from prior\nyears, could alter the amount\nof VA that is needed against\nsuch FTCs. The VA for the\ngeneral basket decreased by $\n0.2billion to $ 0.8billion,\nprimarily due to audit\nadjustments. Citi continues to\nlook for additional actions\nthat may become prudent and\nfeasible, taking into account\nclient, regulatory and\noperational considerations.\n\nThe VA for U.S. residual DTA\nrelated to its non-U.S.\nbranches was unchanged at $\n1.0billion. In addition, the\nnon-U.S. local VA was\nunchanged at $ 0.6billion.\nThe following table summarizes Citi\u2019s DTAs:\n                                                                \n

the passage of time. Although realization is\nnot assured, Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $ 24.8billion at December 31, 2021 is\nmore-likely-than-not, based upon expectations as to future\ntaxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and\nconsideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined\nin ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority of Citi\u2019s U.S. federal\nnet operating loss carry-forward and all of its New York State\nand City net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to a\ncarry-forward period of 20years. This provides enough time to\nfully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these existing NOL carry-\nforwards. This is due to Citi\u2019s forecast of sufficient U.S.\ntaxable income and because New York State and City continue to\ntax Citi\u2019s non-U.S. income. With respect to the FTCs component\nof the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10years. Utilization of\nFTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% of foreign source\ntaxable income in that year. However, ODL that Citi has incurred\nof approximately $ 15billion as of December 31, 2021 are allowed\nto be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of\n50%\u2013 100% (at taxpayer\u2019s election) of domestic source income\nproduced in subsequent years. Such resulting foreign source\nincome would support the realization of the FTC carry-forwards\nafter VA. As noted in the tables above, Citi\u2019s FTC carry-\nforwards were $ 2.8billion ($ 5.3billion before VA) as of\nDecember 31, 2021, compared to $ 4.4billion as of December 31,\n2020. Citi believes that it will more-likely-than-not generate\nsufficient U.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward\nperiod to be able to utilize the net FTCs after the VA, after\nconsidering any FTCs produced in the tax return for such period,\nwhich must be used prior to any carry-forward utilization.\n                              186                               \n                                                                \n  10.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation.\nThe resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized\nfinancing transactions. Citi executes these transactions\nprimarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate\ncustomer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion\nof Citi\u2019s trading inventory. Transactions executed by Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing\nactivity.\n\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market\nconditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages\nthese activities by taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi\nmanages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions\nby conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in\ncapacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client\nactions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty\ndiversification by establishing concentration triggers and\nassessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\n\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary,\n\nrequire prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to\nmaintain contractual margin protection. For resale and\nrepurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. Collateral typically consists of government and\ngovernment-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds,\nequities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The\nresale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother type of default under the relevant master agreement.\nEvents of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash\nor securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to\nprovide or return cash or securities as used for margining\npurposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to\nanother transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some\ncases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation of obligations\nunder the agreement. The counterparty that receives the\nsecurities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in\nits use of the securities, with the exception of transactions\nexecuted on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is\nmaintained by a custodian and operational limitations may\nrestrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the\nresale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value, as\ndescribed in Notes 24 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of\ncash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as\nspecified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing\nand lending agreements also represent collateralized financing\ntransactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements.\nCollateral typically consists of government and government-\nagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.\nSimilar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities\nborrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother default by the other party under the relevant master\nagreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under\nthe securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to\nthe resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A\nsubstantial portion of securities borrowing and lending\nagreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection.\n                              188                               \nThe enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the\nmaster netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements,\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to\nthe extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained\nfrom counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding the enforceability of these\nagreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting\nparty to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not have\nbeen sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local\nlaw is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the\nenforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may\nbe nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For\nexample, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. The\nfollowing tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and\nthe related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45.\nThe tables also include amounts related to financial instruments\nthat are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but\nwould be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained.\nRemaining exposures continue to be secured by financial\ncollateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to\nobtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the\noffsetting right.\n                                                                \n

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND\nBROKERAGE PAYABLES\n\nThe Company has receivables\nand payables for financial\ninstruments sold to and\npurchased from brokers,\ndealers and customers, which\narise in the ordinary course\nof business. Citi is exposed\nto risk of loss from the\ninability of brokers, dealers\nor customers to pay for\npurchases or to deliver the\nfinancial instruments sold, in\nwhich case Citi would have to\nsell or purchase the financial\ninstruments at prevailing\nmarket prices. Credit risk is\nreduced to the extent that an\nexchange or clearing\norganization acts as a\ncounterparty to the\ntransaction and replaces the\nbroker, dealer or customer in\nquestion.\n\nCiti seeks to protect itself\nfrom the risks associated with\ncustomer activities by\nrequiring customers to\nmaintain margin collateral in\ncompliance with regulatory and\ninternal guidelines.

The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and will be\namortized over the remaining life of the securities.\nThe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these\nsecurities to maturity or, where applicable, until the exercise\nof any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen significant\nchanges in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or\nchanges in regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized\nlosses classified in AOCI for HTM debt securities primarily\nrelate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were\ntransferred to HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge\nadjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also includes any\nnon-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM debt securities\nthat have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The\nAOCI balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an\nadjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion\nof any difference between the carrying value at the transfer\ndate

There were no\npurchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt securities held by the\nCompany as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                              198                               \nEvaluating Investments for Impairment AFS Debt Securities\nOverview\u2014AFS Debt Securities The Company conducts periodic\nreviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to\nevaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit\nlosses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company\u2019s\nintent to sell such securities. An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2021. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities The process for estimating credit losses in\nCitigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on\na credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.\nCiti monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing\ndefault protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance.\nThe average external credit rating, disregarding any insurance,\nis Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other\nindicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-\nspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer\ndefault), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse\nchanges in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              199

value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants.\n\nWhen the qualitative\nassessment indicates that\nimpairment exists, the\ninvestment is written down to\nfair value, with the full\ndifference between the fair\nvalue of the investment and\nits carrying amount recognized\nin earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at December 31, 2021\nand 2020:\n                                                                \n  In millions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2021                   2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value     $            1,413    $               962  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                      Years ended December             \n  Measurement                                   31,             \n  alternative(1):                              2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses        $                     25    $    56  \n  Downward changes for                            \u2014         19  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                            406        144  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                     December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           87  \n  Downward changes for                                       3  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       699  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Consumer\nLoans Consumer loans represent\nloans and leases managed\nprimarily by GCB and\nCorporate/Other. Citigroup has\nestablished a risk management\nprocess to monitor, evaluate\nand manage the principal risks\nassociated with its consumer\nloan portfolio. Credit quality\nindicators that are actively\nmonitored include delinquency\nstatus, consumer credit scores\nunder Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) and loan to value (LTV)\nratios, each as discussed in\nmore detail below. Delinquency\nStatus Delinquency status is\nmonitored and considered a key\nindicator of credit quality of\nconsumer loans. Principally,\nthe U.S. residential first\nmortgage loans use the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n(MBA) method of reporting\ndelinquencies, which considers\na loan delinquent if a monthly\npayment has not been received\nby the end of the day\nimmediately preceding the\nloan\u2019s next due date. All\nother loans use a method of\nreporting delinquencies that\nconsiders a loan delinquent if\na monthly payment has not been\nreceived by the close of\nbusiness on the loan\u2019s next\ndue date. As a general policy,\nresidential first mortgages,\nhome equity loans and\ninstallment loans are\nclassified as non-accrual when\nloan payments are 90days\ncontractually past due. Credit\ncards and unsecured revolving\nloans generally accrue\ninterest until payments are\n180days past due. Home equity\nloans in regulated bank\nentities are classified as\nnon-accrual if the related\nresidential first mortgage is\n90days or more past due.\nMortgage loans, other than\nFederal Housing Administration\n(FHA)-insured loans, are\nclassified as non-accrual\nwithin 60days of notification\nthat the borrower has filed\nfor bankruptcy.\n\nThe policy for re-aging\nmodified U.S. consumer loans\nto current status varies by\nproduct. Generally, one of the\nconditions to qualify for\nthese modifications is that a\nminimum number of payments\n(typically ranging from oneto\nthree) be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-\naged to current status.\nHowever, re-aging practices\nfor certain open-ended\nconsumer loans, such as credit\ncards, are governed by Federal\nFinancial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC)\nguidelines. For open-ended\nconsumer loans subject to\nFFIEC guidelines, one of the\nconditions for a loan to be\nre-aged to current status is\nthat at least threeconsecutive\nminimum monthly payments, or\nthe equivalent amount, must be\nreceived. In addition, under\nFFIEC guidelines, the number\nof times that such a loan can\nbe re-aged is subject to\nlimitations (generally once in\n12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n(VA) loans are modified under\nthose respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines and payments are\nnot always required in order\nto re-age a modified loan to\ncurrent.\n                              204                               \nThe following tables provide Citi\u2019s consumer loans by type:\nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December\n31, 2021\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December\n31, 2020\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(2) Includes $ 12million and $ 14million at December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, of residential first mortgages recorded\nat fair value.\n(3) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies.\n(4) Loans modified under Citi\u2019s consumer relief programs\ncontinue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were\nin at the time of modification.

that all amounts due according to the\noriginal contractual terms of the loan will not be collected.\nImpaired consumer loans include non-accrual loans, as well as\nsmaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified\ndue to the borrower\u2019s financial difficulties and where Citi has\ngranted a concession to the borrower. These modifications may\ninclude interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness.\nImpaired consumer loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous\nloans that have not been modified and are carried on a non-\naccrual basis.

The\nCompany did not have\nsignificant purchases of\ncorporate loans classified as\nheld-for-investment for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021\nor 2020.\n\nLease financing Citi is a\nlessor in the power, railcars,\nshipping and aircraft sectors,\nwhere the Company has executed\noperating, direct financing\nand leveraged leases. Citi\u2019s $\n0.5billion of lease financing\nreceivables, as of December\n31, 2021, is composed of\napproximately equal balances\nof direct financing lease\nreceivables and net\ninvestments in leveraged\nleases. Citi uses the interest\nrate implicit in the lease to\ndetermine the present value of\nits lease financing\nreceivables. Interest income\non direct financing and\nleveraged leases during the\nyear ended December 31, 2021\nwas not material. The\nCompany\u2019s leases have an\naverage remaining maturity of\napproximately three and a half\nyears. In certain cases, Citi\nobtains residual value\ninsurance from third parties\nand/or the lessee to manage\nthe risk associated with the\nresidual value of the leased\nassets. The receivable related\nto the residual value of the\nleased assets is $ 0.2billion\nas of December 31, 2021, while\nthe amount covered by residual\nvalue guarantees is nil. The\nCompany\u2019s operating leases,\nwhere Citi is a lessor, are\nnot significant to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. Delinquency Status\nCiti generally does not manage\ncorporate loans on a\ndelinquency basis. Corporate\nloans are identified as\nimpaired and placed on a cash\n(non-accrual) basis when it is\ndetermined, based on actual\nexperience and a forward-\nlooking assessment of the\ncollectability of the loan in\nfull, that the payment of\ninterest or principal is\ndoubtful or when interest or\nprincipal is 90days past due,\nexcept when the loan is well\ncollateralized and in the\nprocess of collection. Any\ninterest accrued on impaired\ncorporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days and charged\nagainst current earnings, and\ninterest is thereafter\nincluded in earnings only to\nthe extent actually received\nin cash. When there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate\ncollectability of principal,\nall cash receipts are\nthereafter applied to reduce\nthe recorded investment in the\nloan.

past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are\n90days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30days past due are presented as current.\n(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not\nincluded in the various delinquency columns.\n\nCitigroup has a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and\nmanage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan\nportfolio. As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns\nnumeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on\nquantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and\nfacility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or\nmore often if material events related to the obligor or facility\nwarrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings\ninclude financial condition of the obligor, qualitative\nassessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of\nrepayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee\narrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated\nwith the obligor and the obligor\u2019s industry and geography. The\nobligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default\nprobabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges\nof loss norms, which are the product of the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating\ncategories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Loans classified according to the\nbank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the non-\ninvestment-grade categories.\n

payments. Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification. Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                             TDR                        TDR     \n                             loans                      loans   \n                             that                       that    \n                             re-de\u2026                     re-de\u2026  \n                             in                         in      \n                   TDR       2021             TDR       2020    \n               balanc\u2026       within       balanc\u2026       within  \n  In\u00a0               at       one               at       one     \n  milli\u2026       Decemb\u2026       year         Decemb\u2026       year    \n  of\u00a0              31,       of               31,       of      \n  dolla\u2026          2021       modif\u2026          2020       modif\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and       $      236    $  \u2014         $      325    $  \u2014       \n  indus\u2026                                                        \n  Finan\u2026             \u2014       \u2014                  \u2014       \u2014       \n  insti\u2026                                                        \n  Mortg\u2026                                                        \n  and               73       \u2014                 92       \u2014       \n  real                                                          \n  estate                                                        \n  Lease              \u2014       \u2014                  \u2014       \u2014       \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Other             41       \u2014                 33       \u2014       \n  Total\u2026    $      350    $  \u2014         $      450    $  \u2014       \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              218                               \n                                                                \n  15.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test using\ndata as of July 1, 2021, at the level below each operating\nsegment (referred to as a reporting unit). The fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s reporting units as a percentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from approximately 125% to 153%, resulting in\nnoimpairment. While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the\neconomic and business environments continue to evolve as\nmanagement implements its strategic refresh, which includes,\namong others, the exits of consumer businesses in 13 markets in\nAsia and EMEA , as well as the exit of the Mexico consumer,\nsmall business and middle-market banking operations, and Citi\u2019s\nimplementation of its new operating segment and reporting unit\nstructure in the first quarter of 2022. If management\u2019s future\nestimate of key economic and market assumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment charges in the future. Citi expects\nthat the implementation of its new operating segments and\nreporting units in the first quarter of 2022, as well as the\ntiming and sequencing of the sales of its Asia consumer banking\nbusinesses, may result in goodwill impairment.

Banking\nSubsidiaries\u2014Constraints on Dividends There are various legal\nlimitations on the ability of Citigroup\u2019s subsidiary depository\ninstitutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply\nfunds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval\nof the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if\ntotal dividends declared in any calendar year were to exceed\namounts specified by the agency\u2019s regulations. In determining\nthe dividends, each subsidiary depository institution must also\nconsider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and\nleverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the\nfederal bank regulatory agencies that indicate that banking\norganizations should generally pay dividends out of current\noperating earnings. Citigroup received $ 6.2billion and $\n2.3billion in dividends from Citibank during 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n                              228                               \n19.

SECURITIZATIONS AND\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nUses of Special Purpose\nEntities A special purpose\nentity (SPE) is an entity\ndesigned to fulfill a specific\nlimited need of the company\nthat organized it. The\nprincipal uses of SPEs by Citi\nare to assist clients in\nsecuritizing their financial\nassets and to create\ninvestment products for\nclients and to obtain\nliquidity and optimize capital\nefficiency by securitizing\ncertain of Citi\u2019s financial\nassets. SPEs may be organized\nin various legal forms,\nincluding trusts, partnerships\nor corporations. In a\nsecuritization, through the\nSPE\u2019s issuance of debt and\nequity instruments,\ncertificates, commercial paper\nor other notes of\nindebtedness, the company\ntransferring assets to the SPE\nconverts all (or a portion) of\nthose assets into cash before\nthey would have been realized\nin the normal course of\nbusiness. These issuances are\nrecorded on the balance sheet\nof the SPE, which may or may\nnot be consolidated onto the\nbalance sheet of the company\nthat organized the SPE.\nInvestors usually have\nrecourse only to the assets in\nthe SPE, but may also benefit\nfrom other credit\nenhancements, such as a\ncollateral account, a line of\ncredit or a liquidity\nfacility, such as a liquidity\nput option or asset purchase\nagreement. Because of these\nenhancements, the SPE\nissuances typically obtain a\nmore favorable credit rating\nthan the transferor could\nobtain for its own debt\nissuances. This results in\nless expensive financing costs\nthan unsecured debt. The SPE\nmay also enter into derivative\ncontracts in order to convert\nthe yield or currency of the\nunderlying assets to match the\nneeds of the SPE investors or\nto limit or change the credit\nrisk of the SPE. Citigroup may\nbe the provider of certain\ncredit enhancements as well as\nthe counterparty to any\nrelated derivative contracts.\nMost of Citigroup\u2019s SPEs are\nvariable interest entities\n(VIEs).\n\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are described in Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Investors that\nfinance the VIE through debt\nor equity interests or other\ncounterparties providing other\nforms of support, such as\nguarantees, certain fee\narrangements or certain types\nof derivative contracts, are\nvariable interest holders in\nthe entity. The variable\ninterest holder, if any, that\nhas a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary and\nmust consolidate the VIE. The\nCompany must evaluate each VIE\nto understand the purpose and\ndesign of the entity, the role\nthe Company had in the\nentity\u2019s design and its\ninvolvement in the VIE\u2019s\nongoing activities. The\nCompany then must evaluate\nwhich activities most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nVIE and who has the power to\ndirect such activities. For\nthose VIEs where the Company\ndetermines that it has the\npower to direct the activities\nthat most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, the Company must\nthen evaluate its economic\ninterests, if any, and\ndetermine whether it could\nabsorb losses or receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be significant to\nthe VIE. When evaluating\nwhether the Company has an\nobligation to absorb losses\nthat could potentially be\nsignificant, it considers the\nmaximum exposure to such loss\nwithout consideration of\nprobability. Such obligations\ncould be in various forms,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ndebt and equity investments,\nguarantees, liquidity\nagreements and certain\nderivative contracts. In\nvarious other transactions,\nthe Company may (i) act as a\nderivative counterparty (e.g.,\ninterest rate swap, cross-\ncurrency swap or purchaser of\ncredit protection under a\ncredit default swap or total\nreturn swap where the Company\npays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE),\n(ii) act as underwriter or\nplacement agent, (iii) provide\nadministrative, trustee or\nother services or (iv) make a\nmarket in debt securities or\nother instruments issued by\nVIEs. The Company generally\nconsiders such involvement, by\nitself, not to be variable\ninterests and thus not an\nindicator of power or\npotentially significant\nbenefits or losses.\n

2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nre-securitization SPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-\nsecuritizations\u201d below for further discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 100billion and $\n78billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 497million and $\n425million in maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively.\n                              235                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n55.6billion and $ 57.0billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Notes 14 and 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by\nthird parties in which the Company holds securities in\ninventory, as these investments are made on arm\u2019s-length terms;\n\u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities\nheld by the Company, which are classified as Trading account\nassets or Investments , in which the Company has no other\ninvolvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be\nsignificant (for more information on these positions, see Notes\n13 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE).

In general, the third-party\ninvestors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal\nrecourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not\nhave such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has\nprovided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to\ncertain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus,\nCitigroup\u2019s maximum legal exposure to loss related to\nconsolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value\nof the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party\nfinancing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted\nfrom being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from\nthese assets are the only source used to pay down the associated\nliabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi\u2019s general assets.\nSee the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about\nthese Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\n\nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2021                   2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash               $                \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   1.4                    2.0  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                       8.8                   10.6  \n  Total loans,                                                  \n  net of                           35.4                   29.3  \n  allowance                                                     \n  Other                             0.8                    0.3  \n  Total assets       $             46.4    $              42.2  \n                                                                \n                              237                               \nCredit Card Securitizations The Company securitizes credit card\nreceivables through trusts established to purchase the\nreceivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on\na non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving\nsecuritizations: as customers pay their credit card balances,\nthe cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and\nreplenish the receivables in the trust. Substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s credit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority\nthrough the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities\nbecause, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller\u2019s interest\nand certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result\nin exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from\nthe trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables\nremain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet with nogain or loss\nrecognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citi utilizes\nsecuritizations as one of the sources of funding for its\nbusiness in North America .

Once\noriginated, the Company often securitizes these loans through\nthe use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of\ntrust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets.\nThese certificates have the same life as the transferred assets.\nIn addition to providing a source of liquidity and less\nexpensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi\u2019s\ncredit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan\nsecuritizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers\nof the securities issued by the trust. Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in\ncertain instances retains investment securities, interest-only\nstrips and residual interests in future cash flows from the\ntrusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of ICG\nsecuritizations. Citi\u2019s ICG business may hold investment\nsecurities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in\nconnection with secondary market-making activities. The Company\nsecuritizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or\nFreddie Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label\n(non-agency-sponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the\nprimary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization entities because Citigroup does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIEs that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nTherefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored\nmortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the\nconsumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated\ntrusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans.\nRetained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization trusts are classified as Trading account assets ,\nexcept for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup does not\nconsolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power\nto direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is\nthe servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a\nfiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the\nCompany has (i) the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance and (ii)\nthe obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could be potentially significant to its non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and,\ntherefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates\nthe VIE.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage\nsecuritizations:\n                                                                \n          2\u2026                20\u2026                20\u2026              \n  \u2026       U\u2026                U.\u2026                U.\u2026              \n  \u2026       a\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026     \n  \u2026       s\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026     \n  \u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  9.4    $  1\u2026    $  5.3    $  1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       6\u2026       2\u2026       10\u2026       1\u2026       5.5       1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026        \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014        \u2014         \u2014           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.4        \u2014       0.2           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(1) The proceeds from new securitizations in 2019 include $\n0.2billion related to personal loan securitizations.\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the\ntransfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale\naccounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the carrying value of the transferred assets\nand the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial\ninterests or servicing rights).

the\nsecuritization of mortgage\nloans, Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally\nretains the servicing rights,\nwhich entitle the Company to a\nfuture stream of cash flows\nbased on the outstanding\nprincipal balances of the\nloans and the contractual\nservicing fee. Failure to\nservice the loans in\naccordance with contractual\nrequirements may lead to a\ntermination of the servicing\nrights and the loss of future\nservicing fees. These\ntransactions create intangible\nassets referred to as MSRs,\nwhich are recorded at fair\nvalue on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The fair value\nof Citi\u2019s capitalized MSRs was\n$ 404million and $ 336million\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The MSRs\ncorrespond to principal loan\nbalances of $ 47billion and $\n53billion as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:\n                                                              \n  In millions of dollars                     2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, beginning of year              $   336    $   495  \n  Originations                                 92        123  \n  Changes in fair value of MSRs due to         43       -204  \n  changes in inputs and assumptions                           \n  Other changes(1)                            -67        -78  \n  Sales of MSRs                                 \u2014          \u2014  \n  Balance, as of December 31              $   404    $   336  \n                                                              \n(1) Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of\ntime.\nThe fair value of the MSRs is\nprimarily affected by changes\nin prepayments of mortgages\nthat result from shifts in\nmortgage interest rates.\nSpecifically, higher interest\nrates tend to lead to\ndeclining prepayments, which\ncauses the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase. In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets .\nThe Company receives fees during the course of servicing\npreviously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were\nas follows:\n                                                               \n  In millions of dollars       2021       2020        2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Servicing fees            $   131    $   142     $   148     \n  Late fees                       3             5           8  \n  Ancillary fees                  \u2014          \u2014              1  \n  Total MSR fees            $   134    $   147     $   157     \n                                                               \nIn the Consolidated Statement\nof Income these fees are\nprimarily classified as\nCommissions and fees , and\nchanges in MSR fair values are\nclassified as Other revenue .\nRe-securitizations The Company\nengages in re-securitization\ntransactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to\na VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the\n\nyears ended December 31, 2021\nand 2020. These securities are\nbacked by either residential\nor commercial mortgages and\nare often structured on behalf\nof clients. As of December 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nCiti held no retained\ninterests in private label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 46.6billion\nand $ 42.8billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.2billion\n(including $ 641million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2021)\ncompared to $ 1.6billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 (including $\n916million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2020), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020 were\napproximately $ 78.4billion\nand $ 83.6billion,\nrespectively. As of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\ndid not consolidate any\nprivate label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities. Citi-\nAdministered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits The\nCompany is active in the\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduit business as\nadministrator of several\nmulti-seller commercial paper\nconduits and also as a service\nprovider to single-seller and\nother commercial paper\nconduits sponsored by third\nparties. Citi\u2019s multi-seller\ncommercial paper conduits are\ndesigned to provide the\nCompany\u2019s clients access to\nlow-cost funding in the\ncommercial paper markets. The\nconduits purchase assets from\nor provide financing\nfacilities to clients and are\nfunded by issuing commercial\npaper to third-party\ninvestors. The conduits\ngenerally do not purchase\nassets originated by Citi. The\nfunding of the conduits is\nfacilitated by the liquidity\nsupport and credit\nenhancements provided by the\nCompany. As administrator to\nCiti\u2019s conduits, the Company\nis generally responsible for\nselecting and structuring\nassets purchased or financed\nby the conduits, making\ndecisions regarding the\nfunding of the conduits,\nincluding determining the\ntenor and other features of\nthe commercial paper issued,\nmonitoring the quality and\nperformance of the conduits\u2019\nassets and facilitating the\noperations and cash flows of\nthe conduits. In return, the\nCompany earns structuring fees\nfrom customers for individual\ntransactions and earns an\nadministration fee from the\nconduit, which is equal to the\nincome from the client program\nand liquidity fees of the\nconduit after payment of\nconduit expenses. This\nadministration fee is fairly\nstable, since most risks and\nrewards of the underlying\nassets are passed back to the\nclients. Once the asset\npricing is negotiated, most\nongoing income, costs and fees\nare relatively stable as a\npercentage of the conduit\u2019s\nsize.\n                              242                               \nThe conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest in\nliquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The\nassets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that\nare generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than\nactively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on\neach asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper\nissued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the\nclient. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with\ntransaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the\nthird-party client seller, including over-collateralization,\ncash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with\nthe objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above,\nbased on Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 14.0billion and $ 16.7billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of approximately $ 18.3billion and $\n17.1billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of\nthe conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted average remaining lives\nof the commercial paper issued by the conduits were\napproximately 70and 54days, respectively. The primary credit\nenhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit enhancements described above. Each\nasset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party\nclient seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess\nspread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party\nguarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the\nobjective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based\non Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the\ngovernment- guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of\ncredit from the Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the\nconduit\u2019s assets with a minimum of $ 200million. The letters of\ncredit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 1.3billion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n1.5billion as of December 31, 2020. The net result across multi-\nseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the\nevent that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. Citigroup also provides the conduits with two\nforms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding\nto the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other\nevents. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a\ntransaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset\npurchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has\ngenerally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables\nfrom the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to provide\ncredit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit\nthe purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under\nthe APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to\nincreased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the\nconduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term\nlending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has\nagreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term\ndisruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified\nconditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types\nof liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair\nmarket terms. Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in\nthe commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-\nbased fee for providing such services. Along with third-party\ndealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and\nmay from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a\nthird party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the\nmarket, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper\nissued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as\nconduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the\nnormal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper,\nincluding commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company owned $ 4.9billion and $\n6.6billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not driven\nby market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any\nagreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are\nconsolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through\nits roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact\nthe entities\u2019 economic performance. These powers include its\nability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the\nconduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation\nactivities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the\nconduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result\nof all the Company\u2019s involvement described above, it was\nconcluded that Citi has an economic interest that could\npotentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities\nof the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup.\nNo assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors\nof Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries. Collateralized\nLoan Obligations (CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO)\nis a VIE that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting\nprimarily of non-investment grade corporate loans. CLOs issue\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the\nasset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming\nthe CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to\npurchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor\nthe credit risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a\nCLO, the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in\na manner consistent with the CLO\u2019s asset management agreement\nand indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager will have the\npower to direct the activities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the CLO.\nInvestors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt and/or\nequity in it, can also direct certain activities of the CLO,\nincluding removing its asset manager under limited\ncircumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on\namendments to the CLO\u2019s operating documents and other\nactivities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12years. Citi\nserves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the\nCLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the\n                              243                               \nCLOs are sold to third-party\ninvestors. On occasion,\ncertain Citi entities may\npurchase some portion of a\nCLO\u2019s liabilities for\ninvestment purposes. In\naddition, Citi may purchase,\ntypically in the secondary\nmarket, certain securities\nissued by the CLOs to support\nits market-making activities.\nThe Company generally does not\nhave the power to direct the\nactivities that most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nCLOs, as this power is\ngenerally held by a third-\nparty asset manager of the\nCLO. As such, those CLOs are\nnot consolidated.

Those\nloans are subject to the same\ncredit approvals as all other\nloans originated or purchased\nby the Company. Financings in\nthe form of debt securities or\nderivatives are, in most\ncircumstances, reported in\nTrading account assets and\naccounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings.

TOB trusts are\ntypically structured as\nsingle-issuer entities whose\nassets are purchased from\neither the Company or from\nother investors in the\nmunicipal securities market.\nTOB trusts finance the\npurchase of their municipal\nassets by issuing two classes\nof certificates: long-dated,\nfloating rate certificates\n(\u201cFloaters\u201d) that are putable\npursuant to a liquidity\nfacility and residual interest\ncertificates (\u201cResiduals\u201d).\nThe Floaters are purchased by\nthird-party investors,\ntypically tax-exempt money\nmarket funds. The Residuals\nare purchased by the original\nowner of the municipal\nsecurities that are being\nfinanced. From Citigroup\u2019s\nperspective, there are\ntwotypes of TOB trusts:\ncustomer and non-customer.\nCustomer TOB trusts are those\ntrusts utilized by customers\nof the Company to finance\ntheir securities, generally\nmunicipal securities. The\nResiduals issued by these\ntrusts are purchased by the\ncustomer being financed. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\ngenerally used by the Company\nto finance its own municipal\nsecurities investments; the\nResiduals issued by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\npurchased by the Company. With\nrespect to both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts, Citi\nmay provide remarketing agent\nservices. If Floaters are\noptionally tendered and the\nCompany, in its role as\nremarketing agent, is unable\nto find a new investor to\npurchase the optionally\ntendered Floaters within a\nspecified period of time,\nCitigroup may, but is not\nobligated to, purchase the\ntendered Floaters into its own\ninventory. The level of the\nCompany\u2019s inventory of such\nFloaters fluctuates. For\ncertain customer TOB trusts,\nCiti may also serve as a\nvoluntary advance provider. In\nthis capacity, the Company\nmay, but is not obligated to,\nmake loan advances to customer\nTOB trusts to purchase\noptionally tendered Floaters\nthat have not otherwise been\nsuccessfully remarketed to new\ninvestors. Such loans are\nsecured by pledged Floaters.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Citi\nhad no outstanding voluntary\nadvances to customer TOB\ntrusts. For certain non-\ncustomer trusts, the Company\nalso provides credit\nenhancement. At December 31,\n2021 and 2020, noneof the\nmunicipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company.\n                              244                               \nCitigroup also provides\nliquidity services to many\ncustomer and non-customer\ntrusts. If a trust is unwound\nearly due to an event other\nthan a credit event on the\nunderlying municipal bonds,\nthe underlying municipal bonds\nare sold out of the trust and\nbond sale proceeds are used to\nredeem the outstanding trust\ncertificates. If this results\nin a shortfall between the\nbond sale proceeds and the\nredemption price of the\ntendered Floaters, the\nCompany, pursuant to the\nliquidity agreement, would be\nobligated to make a payment to\nthe trust to satisfy that\nshortfall. For certain\ncustomer TOB trusts, Citigroup\nhas also executed a\nreimbursement agreement with\nthe holder of the Residual,\npursuant to which the Residual\nholder is obligated to\nreimburse the Company for any\npayment the Company makes\nunder the liquidity\narrangement. These\nreimbursement agreements may\nbe subject to daily margining\nbased on changes in the market\nvalue of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. In cases\nwhere a third party provides\nliquidity to a non-customer\nTOB trust, a similar\nreimbursement arrangement may\nbe executed, whereby the\nCompany (or a consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company), as\nResidual holder, would absorb\nany losses incurred by the\nliquidity provider. For\ncertain other non-customer TOB\ntrusts, Citi serves as tender\noption provider. The tender\noption provider arrangement\nallows Floater holders to put\ntheir interests directly to\nthe Company at any time,\nsubject to the requisite\nnotice period requirements, at\na price of par. At December\n31, 2021 and 2020, liquidity\nagreements provided with\nrespect to customer TOB trusts\ntotaled $ 1.5billion and $\n1.6billion, respectively, of\nwhich $ 0.6billion and $\n0.8billion, respectively, were\noffset by reimbursement\nagreements. For the remaining\nexposure related to TOB\ntransactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed. Citi\nconsiders both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts to be\nVIEs. Customer TOB trusts are\nnot consolidated by the\nCompany, as the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\ntrust\u2019s economic performance\nrests with the customer\nResidual holder, which may\nunilaterally cause the sale of\nthe trust\u2019s bonds. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts generally\nare consolidated because the\nCompany holds the Residual\ninterest and thus has the\nunilateral power to cause the\nsale of the trust\u2019s bonds. The\nCompany also provides other\nliquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-\nsponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable\ninterest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers\nthat totaled $ 2billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and $\n3.6billion as of December 31,\n2020. These liquidity\nagreements and letters of\ncredit are offset by\nreimbursement agreements with\nvarious term-out provisions.\nMunicipal Investments\nMunicipal investment\ntransactions include debt and\nequity interests in\npartnerships that finance the\nconstruction and\nrehabilitation of low-income\nhousing, facilitate lending in\nnew or underserved markets or\nfinance the construction or\noperation of renewable\nmunicipal energy facilities.\nCiti generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the\nreceipt of tax credits and\n\ngrants earned from the\ninvestments made by the\npartnership. The Company may\nalso provide construction\nloans or permanent loans for\nthe development or operation\nof real estate properties held\nby partnerships. These\nentities are generally\nconsidered VIEs. The power to\ndirect the activities of these\nentities is typically held by\nthe general partner.\nAccordingly, these entities\nare not consolidated by\nCitigroup. Client\nIntermediation Client\nintermediation transactions\nrepresent a range of\ntransactions designed to\nprovide investors with\nspecified returns based on the\nreturns of an underlying\nsecurity, referenced asset or\nindex. These transactions\ninclude credit-linked notes\nand equity-linked notes. In\nthese transactions, the VIE\ntypically obtains exposure to\nthe underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index\nthrough a derivative\ninstrument, such as a total-\nreturn swap or a credit-\ndefault swap. In turn, the VIE\nissues notes to investors that\npay a return based on the\nspecified underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index. The\nVIE invests the proceeds in a\nfinancial asset or a\nguaranteed insurance contract\nthat serves as collateral for\nthe derivative contract over\nthe term of the transaction.\nThe Company\u2019s involvement in\nthese transactions includes\nbeing the counterparty to the\nVIE\u2019s derivative instruments\nand investing in a portion of\nthe notes issued by the VIE.\nIn certain transactions, the\ninvestor\u2019s maximum risk of\nloss is limited and the\nCompany absorbs risk of loss\nabove a specified level. Citi\ndoes not have the power to\ndirect the activities of the\nVIEs that most significantly\nimpact their economic\nperformance and thus it does\nnot consolidate them. Citi\u2019s\nmaximum risk of loss in these\ntransactions is defined as the\namount invested in notes\nissued by the VIE and the\nnotional amount of any risk of\nloss absorbed by Citi through\na separate instrument issued\nby the VIE. The derivative\ninstrument held by the Company\nmay generate a receivable from\nthe VIE (e.g., where the\nCompany purchases credit\nprotection from the VIE in\nconnection with the VIE\u2019s\nissuance of a credit-linked\nnote), which is collateralized\nby the assets owned by the\nVIE. These derivative\ninstruments are not considered\nvariable interests and any\nassociated receivables are not\nincluded in the calculation of\nmaximum exposure to the VIE.\nInvestment Funds The Company\nis the investment manager for\ncertain investment funds and\nretirement funds that invest\nin various asset classes\nincluding private equity,\nhedge funds, real estate,\nfixed income and\ninfrastructure. Citigroup\nearns a management fee, which\nis a percentage of capital\nunder management, and may earn\nperformance fees. In addition,\nfor some of these funds the\nCompany has an ownership\ninterest in the investment\nfunds. Citi has also\nestablished a number of\ninvestment funds as\nopportunities for qualified\ncolleagues to invest in\nprivate equity investments.\nThe Company acts as investment\nmanager for these funds and\nmay provide colleagues with\nfinancing on both recourse and\nnon-recourse bases for a\nportion of the colleagues\u2019\ninvestment commitments.\n                              245                               \n                                                                \n  22. DERIVATIVES                                               \n                                                                \nIn the ordinary course of\nbusiness, Citigroup enters\ninto various types of\nderivative transactions, which\ninclude: \u2022 Futures and forward\ncontracts , which are\ncommitments to buy or sell at\na future date a financial\ninstrument, commodity or\ncurrency at a contracted price\nthat may be settled in cash or\nthrough delivery of an item\nreadily convertible to cash. \u2022\nSwap contracts , which are\ncommitments to settle in cash\nat a future date or dates that\nmay range from a few days to a\nnumber of years, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or financial\ninstruments, as applied to a\nnotional principal amount. \u2022\nOption contracts , which give\nthe purchaser, for a premium,\nthe right, but not the\nobligation, to buy or sell\nwithin a specified time a\nfinancial instrument,\ncommodity or currency at a\ncontracted price that may also\nbe settled in cash, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or prices.\nSwaps, forwards and some\noption contracts are over-the-\ncounter (OTC) derivatives that\nare bilaterally negotiated\nwith counterparties and\nsettled with those\ncounterparties, except for\nswap contracts that are\nnovated and \"cleared\" through\ncentral counterparties (CCPs).\nFutures contracts and other\noption contracts are\nstandardized contracts that\nare traded on an exchange with\na CCP as the counterparty from\nthe inception of the\ntransaction. Citigroup enters\ninto derivative contracts\nrelating to interest rate,\nforeign currency, commodity\nand other market/credit risks\nfor the following reasons: \u2022\nTrading Purposes : Citigroup\ntrades derivatives as an\nactive market maker. Citigroup\noffers its customers\nderivatives in connection with\ntheir risk management actions\nto transfer, modify or reduce\ntheir interest rate, foreign\nexchange and other\nmarket/credit risks or for\ntheir own trading purposes.\nCitigroup also manages its\nderivative risk positions\nthrough offsetting trade\nactivities, controls focused\non price verification and\ndaily reporting of positions\nto senior managers. \u2022 Hedging\n: Citigroup uses derivatives\nin connection with its own\nrisk management activities to\nhedge certain risks or\nreposition the risk profile of\nthe Company. Hedging may be\naccomplished by applying hedge\naccounting in accordance with\nASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging , or by an economic\nhedge. For example, Citigroup\nissues fixed-rate long-term\ndebt and then enters into a\nreceive-fixed, pay-variable-\nrate interest rate swap with\nthe same tenor and notional\namount to synthetically\nconvert the interest payments\nto a net variable-rate basis.\nThis strategy is the most\ncommon form of an interest\nrate hedge, as it minimizes\nnet interest cost in certain\nyield curve environments.\nDerivatives are also used to\nmanage market risks inherent\nin specific groups of on-\nbalance sheet assets and\nliabilities, including AFS\nsecurities, commodities and\nborrowings, as well as other\ninterest-sensitive assets and\nliabilities. In addition,\nforeign exchange contracts are\nused to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-\n\ndenominated debt, foreign\ncurrency-denominated AFS\nsecurities and net investment\nexposures. Derivatives may\nexpose Citigroup to market,\ncredit or liquidity risks in\nexcess of the amounts recorded\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Market risk on a\nderivative product is the\nexposure created by potential\nfluctuations in interest\nrates, market prices, foreign\nexchange rates and other\nfactors and is a function of\nthe type of product, the\nvolume of transactions, the\ntenor and terms of the\nagreement and the underlying\nvolatility. Credit risk is the\nexposure to loss in the event\nof nonperformance by the other\nparty to satisfy a derivative\nliability where the value of\nany collateral held by Citi is\nnot adequate to cover such\nlosses. The recognition in\nearnings of unrealized gains\non derivative transactions is\nsubject to management\u2019s\nassessment of the probability\nof counterparty default.\nLiquidity risk is the\npotential exposure that arises\nwhen the size of a derivative\nposition may affect the\nability to monetize the\nposition in a reasonable\nperiod of time and at a\nreasonable cost in periods of\nhigh volatility and financial\nstress. Derivative\ntransactions are customarily\ndocumented under industry\nstandard master netting\nagreements, which provide that\nfollowing an event of default,\nthe non-defaulting party may\npromptly terminate all\ntransactions between the\nparties and determine the net\namount due to be paid to, or\nby, the defaulting party.\nEvents of default include (i)\nfailure to make a payment on a\nderivative transaction that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods, (ii) breach of\nagreement that remains uncured\nafter applicable notice and\ngrace periods, (iii) breach of\na representation, (iv) cross\ndefault, either to third-party\ndebt or to other derivative\ntransactions entered into\nbetween the parties, or, in\nsome cases, their affiliates,\n(v) the occurrence of a merger\nor consolidation that results\nin the creditworthiness of a\nparty becoming materially\nweaker and (vi) the cessation\nor repudiation of any\napplicable guarantee or other\ncredit support document.\nObligations under master\nnetting agreements are often\nsecured by collateral posted\nunder an industry standard\ncredit support annex to the\nmaster netting agreement. An\nevent of default may also\noccur under a credit support\nannex if a party fails to make\na collateral delivery that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods. The netting and\ncollateral rights incorporated\nin the master netting\nagreements are considered to\nbe legally enforceable if a\nsupportive legal opinion has\nbeen obtained from counsel of\nrecognized standing that\nprovides (i) the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding\nenforceability and (ii) that\nthe exercise of rights by the\nnon-defaulting party to\nterminate and close-out\ntransactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will\nnot be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event\nof default, including\nbankruptcy, insolvency or\nsimilar proceeding. A legal\nopinion may not be sought for\ncertain jurisdictions where\nlocal law is silent or unclear\nas to the enforceability of\nsuch rights or where adverse\ncase law or conflicting\nregulation may cast doubt on\nthe enforceability of such\nrights. In some jurisdictions\nand for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law may\nnot provide the requisite\nlevel of certainty. For\n                              246                               \nexample, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. Exposure\nto credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility,\nwhich may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their\nobligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and\nclosely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives\ntransactions. Citi considers the level of legal certainty\nregarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master\nnetting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important\nfactor in its risk management process. Specifically, Citi\ngenerally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under\nmaster netting agreements where Citi does not have the requisite\nlevel of legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such\nderivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty\ncredit limits than those executed under enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Cash collateral and security collateral in\nthe form of G10 government debt securities are often posted by a\nparty to a master netting agreement to secure the net open\nexposure of the other party; the receiving party is free to\ncommingle/rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course\nof its business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds,\nmunicipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also be\npledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security\ncollateral posted to open and maintain a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or\nsecurities, may from time to time be segregated in an account at\na third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account control\nagreement. Information pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table\nbelow. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e.,\ncredit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial\nstress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover,\nnotional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting\ntrades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed\ninterest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a\ndifferent counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is\nreported, although these offsetting positions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk. In addition, aggregate derivative\nnotional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the\nnormal course of business based on Citi\u2019s market share, levels\nof client activity and other factors. All derivatives are\nrecorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              247                               \nDerivative

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              248                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGross positive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rules adopted by\nclearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n340billion and $ 280billion as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, of derivative\nassets and derivative\nliabilities that previously\nwould have been reported on a\ngross basis, but are now\nlegally settled and not\nsubject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              249

As a\ngeneral rule, hedge accounting\nis permitted where the Company\nis exposed to a particular\nrisk, such as interest rate or\nforeign exchange risk, that\ncauses changes in the fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nor variability in the expected\nfuture cash flows of an\nexisting asset, liability or a\nforecasted transaction that\nmay affect earnings.\nDerivative contracts hedging\nthe risks associated with\nchanges in fair value are\nreferred to as fair value\nhedges, while contracts\nhedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are\ncash flow hedges. Hedges that\nutilize derivatives or debt\ninstruments to manage the\nforeign exchange risk\nassociated with equity\ninvestments in\nnon-U.S.-dollar-functional-\ncurrency foreign subsidiaries\n(net investment in a foreign\noperation) are net investment\nhedges. To qualify as an\naccounting hedge under the\nhedge accounting rules (versus\nan economic hedge where hedge\naccounting is not applied), a\nhedging relationship must be\nhighly effective in offsetting\nthe risk designated as being\nhedged. The hedging\nrelationship must be formally\ndocumented at inception,\ndetailing the particular risk\nmanagement objective and\nstrategy for the hedge. This\nincludes the item and risk(s)\nbeing hedged, the hedging\ninstrument being used and how\neffectiveness will be\nassessed. The effectiveness of\nthese hedging relationships is\nevaluated at hedge inception\nand on an ongoing basis both\non a retrospective and\nprospective basis, typically\nusing quantitative measures of\ncorrelation, with hedge\nineffectiveness measured and\nrecorded in current earnings.\nHedge effectiveness assessment\nmethodologies are performed in\na similar manner for similar\nhedges, and are used\n\nconsistently throughout the\nhedging relationships. The\nassessment of effectiveness\nmay exclude changes in the\nvalue of the hedged item that\nare unrelated to the risks\nbeing hedged and the changes\nin fair value of the\nderivative associated with\ntime value. Citi excludes\nchanges in the cross-currency\nbasis associated with cross-\ncurrency swaps from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income\n. Discontinued Hedge\nAccounting A hedging\ninstrument must be highly\neffective in accomplishing the\nhedge objective of offsetting\neither changes in the fair\nvalue or cash flows of the\nhedged item for the risk being\nhedged. Management may\nvoluntarily de-designate an\naccounting hedge at any time,\nbut if a hedging relationship\nis not highly effective, it no\nlonger qualifies for hedge\naccounting and must be de-\ndesignated. Subsequent changes\nin the fair value of the\nderivative are recognized in\nOther revenue or Principal\ntransactions , similar to\ntrading derivatives, with no\noffset recorded related to the\nhedged item. For fair value\nhedges, any changes in the\nfair value of the hedged item\nremain as part of the basis of\nthe asset or liability and are\nultimately realized as an\nelement of the yield on the\nitem. For cash flow hedges,\nchanges in fair value of the\nend-user derivative remain in\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) and are included in the\nearnings of future periods\nwhen the forecasted hedged\ncash flows impact earnings.\nHowever, if it becomes\nprobable that some or all of\nthe hedged forecasted\ntransactions will not occur,\nany amounts that remain in\nAOCI related to these\ntransactions must be\nimmediately reflected in Other\nrevenue . The foregoing\ncriteria are applied on a\ndecentralized basis,\nconsistent with the level at\nwhich market risk is managed,\nbut are subject to various\nlimits and controls. The\nunderlying asset, liability or\nforecasted transaction may be\nan individual item or a\nportfolio of similar items.\n                              252                               \nFair Value Hedges Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk\nCitigroup\u2019s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate\nlong-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt\nsecurities or loans. For qualifying fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest\nrevenue or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is\nan asset or a liability. Citigroup has executed a last-of-layer\nhedge, which permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk\nof a stated portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable\nfinancial assets that are expected to remain outstanding for the\ndesignated tenor of the hedge. In accordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment risk when measuring the change in\nfair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk\nunder the last-of-layer approach. Similar to other fair value\nhedges, where the hedged item is an asset, the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to interest rate risk will be presented\nin Interest revenue along with the change in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument. Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to\nforeign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of the entity holding the\nsecurities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract. Citigroup considers the premium\nassociated with forward contracts (i.e., the differential\nbetween the spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of\nhedging; this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally reflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in cross-\ncurrency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity Price Risk Citigroup\nhedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price\nmovements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying\ncommodity. In this hedge, the change in the value of the hedged\ninventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the change in\nthe fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change in the fair value of the hedging\ninstrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward\nrates, Citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and\nthe contractual forward rates under the futures contract from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness, and it is generally\nreflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi\nalso excludes changes in forward rates from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income\n.\n                              253

Variable cash flows from those\nliabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows\nby entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps\nand receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate\nswaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash\nflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or\ndollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and on an\nongoing basis. Citigroup hedges the variability from changes in\na contractually specified rate and recognizes the entire change\nin fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments in AOCI . The\nfull change in the value of the hedging instrument is required\nto be recognized in AOCI , and then recognized in earnings in\nthe same period that the cash flows impact earnings. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  d\u2026       20\u2026                 20\u2026                20\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $            -8\u2026    $            2\u2026              $  7\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                 -51                 -\u2026                 -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $            -8\u2026    $            2\u2026              $  7\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n           Ot\u2026       Net       Ot\u2026       N\u2026       Ot\u2026       N\u2026  \n           re\u2026       in\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026  \n                     in\u2026                 i\u2026                 i\u2026  \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $    \u2014    $  1,\u2026    $    \u2014    $  7\u2026    $    \u2014    $  -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026        -4         \u2014        -4        \u2014        -7        \u2014  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $   -4    $  1,\u2026    $   -4    $  7\u2026    $   -7    $  -\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  N\u2026                                                            \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  in                                                            \n  c\u2026              $  -1\u2026              $  1\u2026              $  1\u2026  \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  h\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  w\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest revenue/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) . For all other hedges, the amounts\nreclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue\nand Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the\nhedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified\nto earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash\nflows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) associated with cash\nflow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12\nmonths of December 31, 2021 is approximately $ 614million. The\nmaximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are\nhedged is 10years. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on\nAOCI is shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                              256                               \nNet Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign\nCurrency Matters\u2014Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows\nthe hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in\na foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards,\ncross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated\ndebt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated\nwith Citigroup\u2019s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-\nfunctional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup records the\nchange in the carrying amount of these investments in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment within AOCI . Simultaneously,\nthe effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also\nrecorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment and any\nineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. For\nderivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup\nfollows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35.\nAccording to that method, all changes in fair value, including\nchanges related to the forward-rate component of the foreign\ncurrency forward contracts and the time value of foreign\ncurrency options, are recorded in Foreign currency translation\nadjustment within AOCI . For foreign currency-denominated debt\ninstruments that are designated as hedges of net investments,\nthe translation gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange\nrate between the functional currency of the respective\nsubsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency\nof Citigroup. To the extent that the notional amount of the\nhedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment,\nand the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging\ninstrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional\ncurrency of the net investment and Citigroup\u2019s functional\ncurrency (or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument,\nsuch instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the\nnet investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. The\npretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign currency translation\nadjustment within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was $\n855million, $( 600) million and $( 569) million for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Economic\nHedges Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge\naccounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome.\nEnd-user derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at\nfair value, with changes in value included in either Principal\ntransactions or Other revenue . For asset/liability management\nhedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost\nunder GAAP. For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815\nhedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply\nASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair\nvalue on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair\nvalue recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be\ncarried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are\naffected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that\ncause a change in the swap\u2019s value, but for which no offsetting\nchange in value is recorded on the debt. Citigroup may\nalternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under\nthe fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made\nupon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the\ndebt is reported in earnings. The changes in fair value of the\nrelated interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings, which\nprovides a natural offset to the debt\u2019s fair value change. To\nthe extent that the two amounts differ because the full change\nin the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the\ninterest rate swap, the difference is automatically captured in\ncurrent earnings. Additional economic hedges include hedges of\nthe credit risk component of commercial loans and loan\ncommitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging\nstrategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting\nhedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs\nand benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged\nitem itself is marked to market through current earnings, such\nas hedges of commitments to originate one- to four-family\nmortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs. Credit Derivatives Citi is a\nmarket maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through\nthese contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on\neither a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi\nalso uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its\ncorporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions\nand to facilitate client transactions. Citi monitors its\ncounterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 99% and 97%,\nrespectively, of the gross receivables are from counterparties\nwith which Citi maintains master netting agreements, collateral\nagreements or settles daily. A majority of Citi\u2019s top\n15counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi) are\ncentral clearing houses, banks, financial institutions or other\ndealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include\nratings-based termination events. However, counterparty ratings\ndowngrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the\nthreshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral. The\nrange of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default\nswaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-linked\nnotes. A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee,\na protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for\nany losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a\nreference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms\nof the derivative contract and the reference entity and are\ngenerally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on\nindebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a\nmore limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit\nderivative transactions that reference emerging market entities\nalso typically include additional credit events to cover the\nacceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a\npayment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be\nprovided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed\nsecurities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the\nspecific derivative contract, then the protection seller makes\nno payments to the protection buyer and receives only the\ncontractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs\nas defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the\n                              257                               \nprotection seller will be\nrequired to make a payment to\nthe protection buyer. Under\ncertain contracts, the seller\nof protection may not be\nrequired to make a payment\nuntil a specified amount of\nlosses has occurred with\nrespect to the portfolio\nand/or may only be required to\npay for losses up to a\nspecified amount. A total\nreturn swap typically\ntransfers the total economic\nperformance of a reference\nasset, which includes all\nassociated cash flows, as well\nas capital appreciation or\ndepreciation. The protection\nbuyer receives a floating rate\nof interest and any\ndepreciation on the reference\nasset from the protection\nseller and, in return, the\nprotection seller receives the\ncash flows associated with the\nreference asset plus any\nappreciation. Thus, according\nto the total return swap\nagreement, the protection\nseller will be obligated to\nmake a payment any time the\nfloating interest rate payment\nplus any depreciation of the\nreference asset exceeds the\ncash flows associated with the\nunderlying asset. A total\nreturn swap may terminate upon\na default of the reference\nasset or a credit event with\nrespect to the reference\nentity, subject to the\nprovisions of the related\ntotal return swap agreement\nbetween the protection seller\nand the protection buyer. A\ncredit option is a credit\nderivative that allows\ninvestors to trade or hedge\nchanges in the credit quality\nof a reference entity. For\nexample, in a credit spread\noption, the option writer\nassumes the obligation to\npurchase or sell credit\nprotection on the reference\nentity at a specified \u201cstrike\u201d\nspread level. The option\npurchaser buys the right to\nsell credit default protection\non the reference entity to, or\npurchase it from, the option\nwriter at the strike spread\nlevel. The payments on credit\nspread options depend either\non a particular credit spread\nor the price of the underlying\ncredit-sensitive asset or\nother reference entity. The\noptions usually terminate if a\ncredit event occurs with\nrespect to the underlying\nreference entity. A credit-\nlinked note is a form of\ncredit derivative structured\nas a debt security with an\nembedded credit default swap.\nThe purchaser of the note\neffectively provides credit\nprotection to the issuer by\nagreeing to receive a return\nthat could be negatively\naffected by credit events on\nthe underlying reference\nentity. If the reference\nentity defaults, the note may\nbe cash settled or physically\nsettled by delivery of a debt\nsecurity of the reference\nentity. Thus, the maximum\namount of the note purchaser\u2019s\nexposure is the amount paid\nfor the credit-linked note.\n                              258                               \nThe following tables

For\nnotional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the\ntotal notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it\nmay hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into\noffsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The\nopen risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely\nmatched after certain cash positions in reference assets are\nconsidered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a\nduration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of\nsubordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit\nderivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to\nevaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned\ninternal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be \u201cBaa/BBB\u201d and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. Citigroup\nevaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives\nfor which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit\nrating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit\nderivatives written on an underlying non-investment-grade\nreference entity represent greater payment risk to the Company.\nThe non-investment-grade category in the table above also\nincludes credit derivatives where the underlying reference\nentity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the\nderivative. The maximum potential amount of future payments\nunder credit derivative contracts presented in the table above\nis based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company\nbelieves that the notional amount for credit protection sold is\nnot representative of the actual loss exposure based on\nhistorical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the\nvalue of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In\naccordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a\ncredit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the\ndifference between the protection sold and the value of the\nreference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit\nprotection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral\npaid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be\ncalculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any\ncredit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a\nrelated master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes,\ndetermining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit\nderivative exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively\nmonitors open credit-risk exposures and manages this exposure by\nusing a variety of strategies, including purchased credit\nderivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the\nreferenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured\nin the table above. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in\nDerivatives Certain derivative instruments contain provisions\nthat require the Company to either post additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the\noccurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of\nthe Company. These events, which are defined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit\nratings of the Company and its affiliates. The fair value\n(excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-\nrelated contingent features that were in a net liability\nposition at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 19billion and $\n25billion, respectively. The Company posted $ 16billion and $\n22billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course\nof business as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of December 31, 2021, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 1.3billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 0.1billion\nupon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral requirements of approximately $\n1.4billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers\nThe Company executes total return swaps that provide it with\nsynthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return\nof the securities or other financial assets referenced in the\ncontract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is\naccompanied by the Company\u2019s transfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically\nin response to the derivative counterparty\u2019s desire to hedge, in\nwhole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative\ncontract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In\ncertain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales,\nresulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndiscussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of\nfinancial assets). For a significant portion of the\ntransactions, the Company has also executed another total return\nswap where the Company passes on substantially all of the\neconomic return of the referenced securities to a different\nthird party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is\nnot exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return\nof the referenced securities. These transactions generally\ninvolve the transfer of the Company\u2019s liquid government bonds,\nconvertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities\nfrom the trading portfolio and are executed with third-party\nfinancial institutions. The accompanying derivatives are\ntypically total return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled\nand subject to ongoing margin requirements. When the conditions\nfor sale accounting are met, the Company reports the transfer of\nthe referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports\nthe accompanying derivative transaction. These transactions\ngenerally do not result in a gain\n                              260                               \nor loss on the sale of the\nsecurity, because the\ntransferred security was held\nat fair value in the Company\u2019s\ntrading portfolio. For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 2.9billion and $ 2.0billion\nas of December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.9billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was $\n13million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n58million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.2billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 135million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n7million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              261                               \n                                                                \n  23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK                             \n                                                                \nConcentrations of credit risk\nexist when changes in\neconomic, industry or\ngeographic factors similarly\naffect groups of\ncounterparties whose aggregate\ncredit exposure is material in\nrelation to Citigroup\u2019s total\ncredit exposure. Although\nCitigroup\u2019s portfolio of\nfinancial instruments is\nbroadly diversified along\nindustry, product and\ngeographic lines, material\ntransactions are completed\nwith other financial\ninstitutions, particularly in\nthe securities trading,\nderivatives and foreign\nexchange businesses. In\nconnection with the Company\u2019s\nefforts to maintain a\ndiversified portfolio, the\nCompany limits its exposure to\nany one geographic region,\ncountry or individual creditor\nand monitors this exposure on\na continuous basis. At\nDecember 31, 2021, Citigroup\u2019s\nmost significant concentration\nof credit risk was with the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies. The Company\u2019s\nexposure, which primarily\nresults from trading assets\nand investments issued by the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies, amounted to $\n414.5billion and $\n370.1billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe German, United Kingdom and\nJapanese governments and their\nagencies, which are rated\ninvestment grade by both\nMoody\u2019s and S&P, were the next\nlargest exposures. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to Germany\namounted to $ 48.9billion and\n$ 51.8billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to the\nUnited Kingdom amounted to $\n31.1billion and $ 26.0billion\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The Company\u2019s\nexposure to Japan amounted to\n$ 30.1billion and $\n35.5billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe foreign government\nexposures are composed of\ninvestment securities, loans\nand trading assets. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to states\nand municipalities amounted to\n$ 22.0billion and $\n26.1billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively,\nand was composed of trading\nassets, investment securities,\nderivatives and lending\nactivities.\n                              262                               \n                                                                \n  24. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                    \n                                                                \nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement , defines fair\nvalue, establishes a\nconsistent framework for\nmeasuring fair value and\nrequires disclosures about\nfair value measurements. Fair\nvalue is defined as the price\nthat would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly\ntransaction between market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date, and\ntherefore represents an exit\nprice. Among other things, the\nstandard requires the Company\nto maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs\nwhen measuring fair value.\nUnder ASC 820-10, the\nprobability of counterparty\ndefault is factored into the\nvaluation of derivative and\nother positions, and the\nimpact of Citigroup\u2019s own\ncredit risk is also factored\ninto the valuation of\nderivatives and other\nliabilities that are measured\nat fair value. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022\nLevel 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data driven selection\ncriteria to determine whether\nan instrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2, or Level 3:\n\u2022 The determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based upon the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices / market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nDetermination of Fair Value\nFor assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value, the\nCompany measures fair value\nusing the procedures set out\nbelow, irrespective of whether\nthe assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value as a\nresult of an election, a non-\nrecurring lower-of-cost-or-\nmarket (LOCOM) adjustment, or\nbecause they are required to\nbe measured at fair value.\nWhen available, the Company\nuses quoted market prices from\nactive markets to determine\nfair value and classifies such\nitems as Level 1. In some\nspecific cases where a market\nprice is available, the\nCompany will apply practical\nexpedients (such as matrix\npricing) to calculate fair\nvalue, in which case the items\nmay be classified as Level 2.\nThe Company may also apply a\nprice-based methodology that\nutilizes, where available,\nquoted prices or other market\ninformation obtained from\nrecent trading activity in\npositions with the same or\nsimilar characteristics to the\nposition being valued. If\nrelevant and observable prices\nare available, those\nvaluations may be classified\nas Level 2. However, when\nthere are one or more\nsignificant unobservable\n\u201cprice\u201d inputs, those\nvaluations will be classified\nas Level 3. Furthermore, when\na quoted price is considered\nstale, a significant\nadjustment to the price of a\nsimilar security may be\nnecessary to reflect\ndifferences in the terms of\nthe actual security or loan\nbeing valued, or\nalternatively, when prices\nfrom independent sources may\nbe insufficient to corroborate\na valuation, the \u201cprice\u201d\ninputs are considered\nunobservable and the fair\nvalue measurements are\nclassified as Level 3. If\nquoted market prices are not\navailable, fair value is based\nupon internally developed\nvaluation techniques that use,\nwhere possible, current\nmarket-based parameters, such\nas interest rates, currency\nrates and option volatilities.\nItems valued using such\ninternally generated valuation\ntechniques are classified\naccording to the lowest level\ninput or value driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified as Level 3 even\nthough there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable. Fair value\nestimates from internal\nvaluation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from\nindependent vendors or\nbrokers. Vendors\u2019 and brokers\u2019\nvaluations may be based on a\nvariety of inputs ranging from\nobserved prices to proprietary\nvaluation models, and the\nCompany assesses the quality\nand relevance of this\ninformation in determining the\nestimate of fair value. The\nfollowing section describes\nthe valuation methodologies\nused by the Company to measure\nvarious financial instruments\nat fair value. Where\nappropriate, the description\nincludes details of the\nvaluation models, the key\ninputs to those models and any\nsignificant assumptions.\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nGenerally, the unit of account\nfor a financial instrument is\nthe individual financial\ninstrument. The Company\napplies market valuation\nadjustments that are\nconsistent with the unit of\naccount, which does not\ninclude adjustment due to the\nsize of the Company\u2019s\nposition, except as follows.\nASC 820-10 permits an\nexception, through an\naccounting policy election, to\nmeasure the fair value of a\nportfolio of financial assets\nand financial liabilities on\nthe basis of the net open risk\nposition\n                              263                               \nwhen certain criteria are met.\nCiti has elected to measure\ncertain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments that\nmeet those criteria, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position.\nThe Company applies market\nvaluation adjustments,\nincluding adjustments to\naccount for the size of the\nnet open risk position,\nconsistent with market\nparticipant assumptions.\nValuation adjustments are\napplied to items classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy to ensure that\nthe fair value reflects the\nprice at which the net open\nrisk position could be exited.\nThese valuation adjustments\nare based on the bid/offer\nspread for an instrument in\nthe market. When Citi has\nelected to measure certain\nportfolios of financial\ninvestments, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position,\nthe valuation adjustment may\ntake into account the size of\nthe position. Credit valuation\nadjustments (CVA) and funding\nvaluation adjustments (FVA)\nare applied to the relevant\npopulation of over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivative instruments\nwhere adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit risk, own\ncredit risk and term funding\nrisk are required to estimate\nfair value. This principally\nincludes derivatives with a\nbase valuation (e.g.,\ndiscounted using overnight\nindexed swap (OIS)) requiring\nadjustment for these effects,\nsuch as uncollateralized\ninterest rate swaps. The CVA\nrepresents a portfolio-level\nadjustment to reflect the risk\npremium associated with the\ncounterparty\u2019s (assets) or\nCiti\u2019s (liabilities) non-\nperformance risk. The FVA\nrepresents a market funding\nrisk premium inherent in the\nuncollateralized portion of a\nderivative portfolio and in\ncertain collateralized\nderivative portfolios that do\nnot include standard credit\nsupport annexes (CSAs), such\nas where the CSA does not\npermit the reuse of collateral\nreceived. Citi\u2019s FVA\nmethodology leverages the\nexisting CVA methodology to\nestimate a funding exposure\nprofile. The calculation of\nthis exposure profile\nconsiders collateral\nagreements in which the terms\ndo not permit the Company to\nreuse the collateral received,\nincluding where counterparties\npost collateral to third-party\ncustodians. Citi\u2019s CVA and FVA\nmethodologies consist of two\nsteps: \u2022 First, the exposure\nprofile for each counterparty\nis determined using the terms\nof all individual derivative\npositions and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation or other\nquantitative analysis to\ngenerate a series of expected\ncash flows at future points in\ntime. The calculation of this\nexposure profile considers the\neffect of credit risk\nmitigants and sources of\nfunding, including pledged\ncash or other collateral and\nany legal right of offset that\nexists with a counterparty\nthrough arrangements such as\nnetting agreements. Individual\nderivative contracts that are\nsubject to an enforceable\nmaster netting agreement with\na counterparty are aggregated\nas a netting set for this\npurpose, since it is those\naggregate net cash flows that\nare subject to nonperformance\nrisk. This process identifies\nspecific, point-in-time future\ncash flows that are subject to\nnonperformance and term\nfunding risk, rather than\nusing the current recognized\nnet asset or liability as a\nbasis to measure the CVA and\nFVA. \u2022 Second, for CVA,\nmarket-based views of default\nprobabilities derived from\nobserved credit spreads in the\n\ncredit default swap (CDS)\nmarket are applied to the\nexpected future cash flows\ndetermined in step one. Citi\u2019s\nown credit CVA is determined\nusing Citi-specific CDS\nspreads for the relevant\ntenor. Generally, counterparty\nCVA is determined using CDS\nspread indices for each credit\nrating and tenor. For certain\nidentified netting sets where\nindividual analysis is\npracticable (e.g., exposures\nto counterparties with liquid\nCDSs), counterparty-specific\nCDS spreads are used. For FVA,\na term structure of spreads is\napplied to the expected\nfunding exposures (e.g., the\nmarket liquidity spread used\nto represent the term funding\npremium associated with\ncertain OTC derivatives). The\nCVA and FVA are designed to\nincorporate a market view of\nthe credit and funding risk,\nrespectively, inherent in the\nderivative portfolio. However,\nmost unsecured derivative\ninstruments are negotiated\nbilateral contracts and are\nnot commonly transferred to\nthird parties. Derivative\ninstruments are normally\nsettled contractually or, if\nterminated early, are\nterminated at a value\nnegotiated bilaterally between\nthe counterparties.

Cash flows are\nestimated based on the terms\nof the contract, taking into\naccount any embedded\nderivative or other features.\nThese cash flows are\ndiscounted using interest\nrates appropriate to the\nmaturity of the instrument as\nwell as the nature of the\nunderlying collateral.\nGenerally, when such\ninstruments are recorded at\nfair value, they are\nclassified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, as\nthe inputs used in the\nvaluation are readily\nobservable. However, certain\nlong-dated positions are\nclassified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.\nTrading Account Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Trading Securities\nand Trading Loans When\navailable, the Company uses\nquoted market prices in active\nmarkets to determine the fair\nvalue of trading securities;\nsuch items are classified as\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Examples include\ngovernment securities and\nexchange-traded equity\nsecurities. For bonds and\nsecondary market loans traded\nover the counter, the Company\ngenerally determines fair\nvalue utilizing various\nvaluation techniques,\nincluding discounted cash\nflows, price-based and\ninternal models. Fair value\nestimates from these internal\nvaluation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from\nindependent sources, including\nthird-party vendors. A price-\nbased methodology utilizes,\nwhere available, quoted prices\nor other market information\nobtained from recent trading\nactivity of assets with\nsimilar characteristics to the\nbond or loan being valued. The\nyields used in discounted cash\nflow models are derived from\nthe same price information.\nTrading securities and loans\npriced using such methods are\ngenerally classified as Level\n2. However, when the primary\ninputs to the valuation are\nunobservable, or prices from\nindependent sources are\ninsufficient to corroborate\nvaluation, a loan or security\nis generally classified as\nLevel 3. Fair value estimates\nfrom these internal valuation\ntechniques are verified, where\npossible, to\n\nprices obtained from\nindependent sources, including\nthird-party vendors. When the\nCompany\u2019s principal exit\nmarket for a portfolio of\nloans is through\nsecuritization, the Company\nuses the securitization price\nas a key input into the fair\nvalue of the loan portfolio.\nThe securitization price is\ndetermined from the assumed\nproceeds of a hypothetical\nsecuritization within the\ncurrent market environment.\nWhere such a price\nverification is possible, loan\nportfolios are typically\nclassified as Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy. For most\nof the subprime mortgage\nbacked security (MBS)\nexposures, fair value is\ndetermined utilizing\nobservable transactions where\navailable, or other valuation\ntechniques such as discounted\ncash flow analysis utilizing\nvaluation assumptions derived\nfrom similar, more observable\nsecurities as market proxies.\nThe valuation of certain\nasset-backed security (ABS)\nCDO positions is inferred\nthrough the net asset value of\nthe underlying assets of the\nABS CDO. Trading Account\nAssets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives,\nmeasured at fair value using\nquoted (i.e., exchange) prices\nin active markets, where\navailable, are classified as\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Derivatives without\na quoted price in an active\nmarket and derivatives\nexecuted over the counter are\nvalued using internal\nvaluation techniques. These\nderivative instruments are\nclassified as either Level 2\nor Level 3 depending on the\nobservability of the\nsignificant inputs to the\nmodel. The valuation\ntechniques depend on the type\nof derivative and the nature\nof the underlying instrument.\nThe principal techniques used\nto value these instruments are\ndiscounted cash flows and\ninternal models, such as\nderivative pricing models\n(e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte\nCarlo simulations). The key\ninputs depend upon the type of\nderivative and the nature of\nthe underlying instrument and\ninclude interest rate yield\ncurves, foreign exchange\nrates, volatilities and\ncorrelation. Investments The\ninvestments category includes\navailable-for-sale debt and\nmarketable equity securities\nwhose fair values are\ngenerally determined by\nutilizing similar procedures\ndescribed for trading\nsecurities above or, in some\ncases, using vendor pricing as\nthe primary source. Also\nincluded in investments are\nnonpublic investments in\nprivate equity and real estate\nentities. Determining the fair\nvalue of nonpublic securities\ninvolves a significant degree\nof management\u2019s judgment, as\nno quoted prices exist and\nsuch securities are not\ngenerally traded. In addition,\nthere may be transfer\nrestrictions on private equity\nsecurities. The Company\u2019s\nprocess for determining the\nfair value of such securities\nutilizes commonly accepted\nvaluation techniques,\nincluding guideline public\ncompany analysis and\ncomparable transactions. In\ndetermining the fair value of\nnonpublic securities, the\nCompany also considers events\nsuch as a proposed sale of the\ninvestee company, initial\npublic offerings, equity\nissuances or other observable\ntransactions. Private equity\nsecurities are generally\nclassified as Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\n                              265                               \nIn addition, the Company holds\ninvestments in certain\nalternative investment funds\nthat calculate NAV per share,\nincluding hedge funds, private\nequity funds and real estate\nfunds. Investments in funds\nare generally classified as\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities carried at fair\nvalue. The fair values of\nthese investments are\nestimated using the NAV per\nshare of the Company\u2019s\nownership interest in the\nfunds where it is not probable\nthat the investment will be\nrealized at a price other than\nthe NAV. Consistent with the\nprovisions of ASU 2015-07,\nthese investments are\ncategorized within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are not\nincluded in the tables below.\nSee Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for additional\ninformation. Short-Term\nBorrowings and Long-Term Debt\nWhere fair value accounting\nhas been elected, the fair\nvalue of non-structured\nliabilities is determined by\nutilizing internal models\nusing the appropriate discount\nrate for the applicable\nmaturity. Such instruments are\nclassified as Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy when all\nsignificant inputs are readily\nobservable. The Company\ndetermines the fair value of\nhybrid financial instruments,\nincluding structured\nliabilities, using the\nappropriate derivative\nvaluation methodology\n(described above in \u201cTrading\nAccount Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\u201d)\ngiven the nature of the\nembedded risk profile. Such\ninstruments are classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 depending\non the observability of\nsignificant inputs to the\nmodel.\n                              266                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

In other instances, market changes\nhave resulted in observable equity forward and volatility inputs\nbecoming an insignificant input to the overall valuation of the\ninstrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money). This has resulted in $ 1.9billion of certain Equity\ncontracts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2. \u2022 During\nthe 12 months ended December 31, 2021, transfers of Long-term\ndebt were $ 8.6billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $\n8.6billion transfer in, approximately $ 7.2billion related to\ninterest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable\nand/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $\n1.0billion related to equity volatility inputs (in addition to\nother volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs)\nbecoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall\nvaluation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in\nsome inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable\ninputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money) . This has resulted in $ 9.8billion of certain\nstructured long-term debt products being transferred from Level\n3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. The\nfollowing were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period\nDecember 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020: \u2022 During the 12 months\nended December 31, 2020, transfers of Interest rate contracts of\n$ 1.6billion from Level 2 to Level 3 were due to interest rate\noption volatility becoming an unobservable and/or significant\ninput relative to the overall valuation of inflation and other\ninterest rate derivatives. \u2022 During the 12 months ended December\n31, 2020, $ 6.6billion of Long-term debt containing embedded\nderivatives was transferred from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result\nof interest rate option volatility, equity correlation and\ncredit derivative inputs becoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant input relative to the overall valuation of certain\nstructured long-term debt products.

                      \nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to Unobservable\nInputs Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient\nor disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the\nexit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today\u2019s\nmarket. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value\ninstruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that\nmay be both unobservable and significant to the instrument\u2019s (or\nportfolio\u2019s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties\nassociated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements may not be independent of one another. In\naddition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair\nvalue measurement for a given change in an unobservable input\ndepends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the\nCompany holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For\ncertain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management\nare sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather\nthan on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\nThe following section describes some of the most significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent\nto which two or more variables change in relation to each other.\nA variety of correlation-related assumptions are required for a\nwide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets,\nforeign exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other\ninstruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations\nare not directly observable in the market and must be calculated\nusing alternative sources, including historical information.\nEstimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may\nvary over time, and calculating correlation information from\nmarket data requires significant assumptions regarding the\ninformational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets).\nUncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate\nlevel of correlation as an input into some fair value\nmeasurements is required. Changes in correlation levels can have\na substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of\nan instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default\ncorrelation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising\na CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior\ntranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of\nthe underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior\ntranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater\nlosses in the event of default and a portion of these losses\nwould become attributable to the senior tranche. That same\nchange in default correlation would have a different impact on\njunior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility\nrepresents the speed and severity of market price changes and is\na key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on\nthe tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or\nlevel defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain\ncombinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to\nbe estimated using alternative methods, such as comparable\ninstruments, historical analysis or other sources of market\ninformation. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair\nvalue measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.\nThe general relationship between changes in the value of an\ninstrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also\ndepends on changes in interest rates and the level of the\nunderlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets)\nbenefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option\npositions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are\nmore sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For\nexample, an at-the-money option would experience a greater\npercentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money\noption. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than\none underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of\nequities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying\nsecurities as well as their correlations. Yield In some\ncircumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in\nthe market and must be estimated from historical data or from\nyields of similar securities. This estimated yield may need to\nbe adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being\nvalued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to\nthe value of the security, the fair value measurement is\nclassified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is generally used to\ndiscount the projected future principal and interest cash flows\non instruments, such as asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield\nis impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and\nrelevant credit spreads. Prepayment Voluntary unscheduled\npayments (prepayments) change the future cash flows for the\ninvestor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The\neffect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential\nmortgage-backed securities. Prepayment is generally negatively\ncorrelated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of\nlow prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input\u2019s\nnegative impact on a mortgage securities\u2019 valuation. As\nprepayment speeds change, the weighted average life of the\nsecurity changes, which impacts the valuation either positively\nor negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and the\ndirection of the change in the weighted average life. Recovery\nRecovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a\nbond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation\nscenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial mortgage\nbacked securities), the expected recovery amount of a defaulted\nproperty is typically unknown until a liquidation of the\nproperty is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security may\ndiffer from its actual recovery that will be observable in the\nfuture. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate assumption\nincreases the fair value of the security. An increase in loss\nseverity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount\nof principal available for distribution and, as a result,\ndecreases the fair value of the security.\n                              279                               \nCredit Spread Credit spread is\na component of the security\nrepresenting its credit\nquality. Credit spread\nreflects the market perception\nof changes in prepayment,\ndelinquency and recovery\nrates, therefore capturing the\nimpact of other variables on\nthe fair value. Changes in\ncredit spread affect the fair\nvalue of securities\ndifferently depending on the\ncharacteristics and maturity\nprofile of the security. For\nexample, credit spread is a\nmore significant driver of the\nfair value measurement of a\nhigh yield bond as compared to\nan investment grade bond.\nGenerally, the credit spread\nfor an investment grade bond\nis also more observable and\nless volatile than its high\nyield counterpart.\n                              280                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and,\ntherefore, are not included in\nthe tables above.

If no such quoted\nprice exists, the fair value\nof a loan is determined using\nquoted prices for a similar\nasset or assets, adjusted for\nthe specific attributes of\nthat loan. Fair value for the\nother real estate owned is\nbased on appraisals. For loans\nwhose carrying amount is based\non the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral, the\nfair values depend on the type\nof collateral. Fair value of\nthe collateral is typically\nestimated based on quoted\nmarket prices if available,\nappraisals or other internal\nvaluation techniques.\n\nWhere the fair value of the\nrelated collateral is based on\nan appraised value, the loan\nis generally classified as\nLevel 3. In addition, for\ncorporate loans, appraisals of\nthe collateral are often based\non sales of similar assets;\nhowever, because the prices of\nsimilar assets require\nsignificant adjustments to\nreflect the unique features of\nthe underlying collateral,\nthese fair value measurements\nare generally classified as\nLevel 3. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities under the\nmeasurement alternative is\nbased on observed transaction\nprices for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same\nissuer, or an internal\nvaluation technique in the\ncase of an impairment. Where\nthere are insufficient market\nobservations to conclude the\ninputs are observable, where\nsignificant adjustments are\nmade to the observed\ntransaction prices or when an\ninternal valuation technique\nis used, the security is\nclassified as Level 3. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n                              281                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair\nValue

The tables below therefore exclude items\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the\ntables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate\ninvestments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance\ncontracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the\ndisclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount\nthat could result from offering for sale at one time the entire\nholdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value\nassociated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other\nexpenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In\naddition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets\nand liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise,\nrelationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full\nassessment of Citigroup\u2019s financial position and the value of\nits net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on\nchanges in a wide range of factors, including interest rates,\ncredit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing\nassets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered\ninto.\n                                                                \n            Dec\u2026                   Est\u2026                         \n

See Notes 19 and 24\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              285                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation. Among other variables, the fair value of\nliabilities for which the fair value option has been elected\n(other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is\nimpacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain\nof $ 296million and a loss of $ 616million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in fair value\nresulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were\nestimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads\nobservable in the bond market into the relevant valuation\ntechnique used to value each liability as described above. The\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to\nResell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest revenue and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nrevenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Decemb\u2026                                         \n                    31,                   December              \n                   2021                   31, 2020              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    9,530    $  6,082    $     8,063    $  6,854  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess           -100         226           -915         -14  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           1              \u2014           4  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           \u2014              \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 719million and $\n1,068million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n                              286                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of\n$ 21million and a loss of $ 16million, respectively. Certain\nInvestments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup invests in\nunallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and\npalladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities or to economically hedge certain exposures from\nissuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is\nbifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract\nwithin Trading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts\nacross unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.3billion and $ 0.5billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on\ntrading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, there were approximately $ 15.2billion and $\n10.5billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of          December 31,                          \n  dollars                         2021       December 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the      $         3,035    $              1,742  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate fair                                                \n  value in excess                                               \n  of (less                          70                      91  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans                                             \n  or loans                           1                       \u2014  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance                                             \n  in                                                            \n  excess of fair                                                \n  value for                          \u2014                       \u2014  \n  non-accrual                                                   \n  loans or loans                                                \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For certain contracts meeting the definition of a\nguarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a\nliability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in\nissuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose\nthe maximum potential amount of future payments that the\nguarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\nThe following tables present information about Citi\u2019s\nguarantees:\n

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be $ 119billion and $ 102billion,\nrespectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure\nis not representative of the actual potential loss exposure\nbased on its historical experience. This contingent liability is\nunlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered\nwhen purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned\nto merchants.\n                              290                               \nFinancial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters\nof credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the\nborrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is\nobligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a\nthird party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial\nstandby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of\ninsurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial\nrevenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment\nobligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-\ncounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below),\n(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of\nescrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop\nloans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade\nacceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and\nletters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer\u2019s tender\nbid on a construction or systems-installation project or to\nguarantee completion of such projects in accordance with\ncontract terms. They are also issued to support a customer\u2019s\nobligation to supply specified products, commodities or\nmaintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative\nInstruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional\namount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,\nwhere there is little or no initial investment, and whose terms\nrequire or permit net settlement. For a discussion of Citi\u2019s\nderivatives activities, see Note 22 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Derivative instruments considered to be\nguarantees include only those instruments that require Citi to\nmake payments to the counterparty based on changes in an\nunderlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability\nor an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More\nspecifically, derivative instruments considered to be guarantees\ninclude certain over-the-counter written put options where the\ncounterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-dealer (such\ncounterparties are considered to be dealers in these markets and\nmay, therefore, not hold the underlying instruments). Credit\nderivatives sold by Citi are excluded from the tables above as\nthey are disclosed separately in Note 22 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. In instances where Citi\u2019s maximum\npotential future payment is unlimited, the notional amount of\nthe contract is disclosed. Loans Sold with Recourse Loans sold\nwith recourse represent Citi\u2019s obligations to reimburse the\nbuyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse\nrefers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a\nseller/lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any\nlosses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be\naccomplished by the sellers taking back any loans that become\ndelinquent. In addition to the amounts shown in the tables\nabove, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential\nrepurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential\nmortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole\nloan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and, to a\nlesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve was\napproximately $ 19million and $ 31million at December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities\nLending Indemnifications Owners of securities frequently lend\nthose securities for a fee to other parties who may sell them\nshort or deliver them to another party to satisfy some other\nobligation. Banks may administer such securities lending\nprograms for their clients. Securities lending indemnifications\nare issued by the bank to guarantee that a securities lending\ncustomer will be made whole in the event that the security\nborrower does not return the security subject to the lending\nagreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the\nmarket value of the security. Credit Card Merchant Processing\nCredit card merchant processing guarantees represent the\nCompany\u2019s indirect obligations in connection with (i) providing\ntransaction processing services to various merchants with\nrespect to its private label cards and (ii) potential liability\nfor bank card transaction processing services. The nature of the\nliability in either case arises as a result of a billing dispute\nbetween a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved\nin the cardholder\u2019s favor. The merchant is liable to refund the\namount to the cardholder. In general, if the credit card\nprocessing company is unable to collect this amount from the\nmerchant, the credit card processing company bears the loss for\nthe amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder. With\nregard to (i) above, Citi has the primary contingent liability\nwith respect to its portfolio of private label merchants. The\nrisk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between Citi and the\nmerchant are settled on a net basis, and Citi has the right to\noffset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the\nmerchant. To further mitigate this risk, Citi may delay\nsettlement, require a merchant to make an escrow deposit,\ninclude event triggers to provide Citi with more financial and\noperational control in the event of the financial deterioration\nof the merchant or require various credit enhancements\n(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the\nunlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to\ndeliver products, services or a refund to its private label\ncardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or refund\ncardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential\nliability for bank card transactions where Citi provides the\ntransaction processing services as well as those where a third\nparty provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary\nguarantor, should that processor fail to perform. Citi\u2019s maximum\npotential contingent liability related to both bank card and\nprivate label merchant processing services is estimated to be\nthe total volume of credit card transactions that meet the\nrequirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given\ntime. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be $ 119.4billion and $ 101.9billion,\nrespectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure\nis not representative of the actual potential loss exposure\nbased on its historical experience. This contingent liability is\nunlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered\nwhen\n                              291                               \npurchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to\nmerchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its\ncontingent liability related to merchant processing based on the\nfinancial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and\nnature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss\nexperience. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the losses incurred\nand the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent obligations\nrelated to merchant processing activities were immaterial.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide coverage for certain losses\nassociated with purchased products, and protection for certain\ntravel-related purchases. These guarantees are not included in\nthe table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees\nand Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the actual and\nestimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi\u2019s\nobligations related to these programs were immaterial. Other\nRepresentation and Warranty Indemnifications In the normal\ncourse of business, Citi provides standard representations and\nwarranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with\nnumerous transactions and also provides indemnifications,\nincluding indemnifications that protect the counterparties to\nthe contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed, due\neither to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation\nof the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide\nCiti with comparable indemnifications. While such\nrepresentations, warranties and indemnifications are essential\ncomponents of many contractual relationships, they do not\nrepresent the underlying business purpose for the transactions.\nThe indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms\nrelated to Citi\u2019s own performance under the terms of a contract\nand are entered into in the normal course of business based on\nan assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these\nclauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met\nat inception. Nocompensation is received for these standard\nrepresentations and warranties, and it is not possible to\ndetermine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result\nin a payment. In many cases, there are nostated or notional\namounts included in the indemnification clauses, and the\ncontingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify\nhave not occurred and are not expected to occur. As a result,\nthese indemnifications are not included in the tables above.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 or 2020 for potential\nobligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement with VTN\nassociations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification In 2000,\nTravelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi,\nentered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and\nrewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now\nGenworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the\nGeneral Electric Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the\nreinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance\nsubsidiaries of GE Life, which funded twocollateral trusts with\nsecurities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are\nreferred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE\u2019s spin-off of\nGenworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated\nwith the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a\nreinsurance contract to Genworth through GE\u2019s Union Fidelity\nLife Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the\nTravelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital\nmaintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to\nassure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance\nobligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the\nspin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from\nUFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in\nconnection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the\nGenworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse\nFinancial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor\nCiti are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance\nagreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit\nindirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance\nagreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have\nfunds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\n                              292                               \nIn connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc.\n(MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for\nlosses (including policyholder claims) relating to the LTC\nbusiness for the entire term of the Travelers LTC policies,\nwhich, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of\nGenworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance\nbusiness to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies\nnow reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement\nbetween Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in\nplace and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth\nTrusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral\nto Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities\nof Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The\nassets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted\nperiodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets\ncontinues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these\nestimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over\ntime. If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two\nGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020 related to this indemnification. However, if both\nevents become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but\nless than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and\ndisclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the\nextent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both\nevents become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such\nliability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\nFutures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides\nclearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients\nthat need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are twotypes of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 18.7billion and $ 16.6billion as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Variation margin due from clients\nto the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for\neach trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to\npost variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of\nnon-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              293                               \nCarrying Value\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At December 31,\n2021 and 2020, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.4billion and $\n2.2billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 56.5billion and $\n51.6billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSecurities and other marketable assets held as collateral\namounted to $ 84.2billion and $ 80.1billion at December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 4.1billion and $\n6.6billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other\nproperty may also be available to Citi to cover losses under\ncertain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of\nsuch property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi\nevaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the\nassigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. On certain\nunderlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not\navailable. Such referenced assets are included in the \u201cnot\nrated\u201d category. The maximum potential amount of the future\npayments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to\nbe the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par\namount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below\nare the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are\nclassified based on internal and external credit ratings. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

contingent\nupon customers maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Commercial\nand Similar Letters of Credit\nA commercial letter of credit\nis an instrument by which\nCitigroup substitutes its\ncredit for that of a customer\nto enable the customer to\nfinance the purchase of goods\nor to incur other commitments.\nCitigroup issues a letter on\nbehalf of its client to a\nsupplier and agrees to pay the\nsupplier upon presentation of\ndocumentary evidence that the\nsupplier has performed in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe letter of credit. When a\nletter of credit is drawn, the\ncustomer is then required to\nreimburse Citigroup. One- to\nFour-Family Residential\nMortgages A one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage\ncommitment is a written\nconfirmation from Citigroup to\na seller of a property that\nthe bank will advance the\nspecified sums enabling the\nbuyer to complete the\npurchase. Revolving Open-End\nLoans Secured by One- to Four-\nFamily Residential Properties\nRevolving open-end loans\nsecured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties are\nessentially home equity lines\nof credit. A home equity line\nof credit is a loan secured by\na primary residence or second\nhome to the extent of the\nexcess of fair market value\nover the debt outstanding for\nthe first mortgage. Commercial\nReal Estate, Construction and\nLand Development Commercial\nreal estate, construction and\nland development include\nunused portions of commitments\nto extend credit for the\npurpose of financing\ncommercial and multifamily\nresidential properties as well\nas land development projects.\n\nBoth secured-by-real-estate\nand unsecured commitments are\nincluded in this line, as well\nas undistributed loan\nproceeds, where there is an\nobligation to advance for\nconstruction progress\npayments. However, this line\nonly includes those extensions\nof credit that, once funded,\nwill be classified as Total\nloans, net on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Credit Card\nLines Citigroup provides\ncredit to customers by issuing\ncredit cards. The credit card\nlines are cancelable by\nproviding notice to the\ncardholder or without such\nnotice as permitted by local\nlaw. Commercial and Other\nConsumer Loan Commitments\nCommercial and other consumer\nloan commitments include\noverdraft and liquidity\nfacilities as well as\ncommercial commitments to make\nor purchase loans, purchase\nthird-party receivables,\nprovide note issuance or\nrevolving underwriting\nfacilities and invest in the\nform of equity. Other\nCommitments and Contingencies\nOther commitments and\ncontingencies include all\nother transactions related to\ncommitments and contingencies\nnot reported on the lines\nabove. Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020,\nCitigroup had approximately $\n126.6billion and $ 71.8billion\nof unsettled reverse\nrepurchase and securities\nborrowing agreements, and\napproximately $ 41.1billion\nand $ 62.5billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively. For a further\ndiscussion of securities\npurchased under agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed, and securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase\nand securities loaned,\nincluding the Company\u2019s policy\nfor offsetting repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsee Note 11 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                              295                               \n                                                                \n  27. CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nAccounting and Disclosure\nFramework ASC 450 governs the\ndisclosure and recognition of\nloss contingencies, including\npotential losses from\nlitigation, regulatory, tax\nand other matters. ASC 450\ndefines a \u201closs contingency\u201d\nas \u201can existing condition,\nsituation, or set of\ncircumstances involving\nuncertainty as to possible\nloss to an entity that will\nultimately be resolved when\none or more future events\noccur or fail to occur.\u201d It\nimposes different requirements\nfor the recognition and\ndisclosure of loss\ncontingencies based on the\nlikelihood of occurrence of\nthe contingent future event or\nevents. It distinguishes among\ndegrees of likelihood using\nthe following three terms:\n\u201cprobable,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe\nfuture event or events are\nlikely to occur\u201d; \u201cremote,\u201d\nmeaning that \u201cthe chance of\nthe future event or events\noccurring is slight\u201d; and\n\u201creasonably possible,\u201d meaning\nthat \u201cthe chance of the future\nevent or events occurring is\nmore than remote but less than\nlikely.\u201d These three terms are\nused below as defined in ASC\n450. Accruals . ASC 450\nrequires accrual for a loss\ncontingency when it is\n\u201cprobable that one or more\nfuture events will occur\nconfirming the fact of loss\u201d\nand \u201cthe amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated.\u201d\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. When the reasonable\nestimate of the loss is within\na range of amounts, the\nminimum amount of the range is\naccrued, unless some higher\namount within the range is a\nbetter estimate than any other\namount within the range. Once\nestablished, accruals are\nadjusted from time to time, as\nappropriate, in light of\nadditional information. The\namount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters. Disclosure . ASC 450\nrequires disclosure of a loss\ncontingency if \u201cthere is at\nleast a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss or an additional\nloss may have been incurred\u201d\nand there is no accrual for\nthe loss because the\nconditions described above are\nnot met or an exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, if Citigroup has not\naccrued for a matter because\nCitigroup believes that a loss\nis reasonably possible but not\nprobable, or that a loss is\nprobable but not reasonably\nestimable, and the reasonably\npossible loss is material, it\ndiscloses the loss\ncontingency. In addition,\nCitigroup discloses matters\nfor which it has accrued if it\nbelieves a reasonably possible\nexposure to material loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure includes an\nestimate of the reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss\nfor those matters as to which\nan estimate can be made. ASC\n450 does not require\ndisclosure of an estimate of\nthe reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss where an\nestimate cannot be made.\nNeither accrual nor disclosure\nis required for losses that\nare deemed remote.\n\nLitigation, Regulatory and\nOther Contingencies Overview.\nIn addition to the matters\ndescribed below, in the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup, its affiliates and\nsubsidiaries, and current and\nformer officers, directors and\nemployees (for purposes of\nthis section, sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties)\nroutinely are named as\ndefendants in, or as parties\nto, various legal actions and\nproceedings. Certain of these\nactions and proceedings assert\nclaims or seek relief in\nconnection with alleged\nviolations of consumer\nprotection, fair lending,\nsecurities, banking,\nantifraud, antitrust, anti-\nmoney laundering, employment\nand other statutory and common\nlaws. Certain of these actual\nor threatened legal actions\nand proceedings include claims\nfor substantial or\nindeterminate compensatory or\npunitive damages, or for\ninjunctive relief, and in some\ninstances seek recovery on a\nclass-wide basis. In the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso are subject to\ngovernmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-\ngathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal),\ncertain of which may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties,\nrestitution, disgorgement,\ninjunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, certain\naffiliates and subsidiaries of\nCitigroup are banks,\nregistered broker-dealers,\nfutures commission merchants,\ninvestment advisors or other\nregulated entities and, in\nthose capacities, are subject\nto regulation by various U.S.,\nstate and foreign securities,\nbanking, commodity futures,\nconsumer protection and other\nregulators. In connection with\nformal and informal inquiries\nby these regulators, Citigroup\nand such affiliates and\nsubsidiaries receive numerous\nrequests, subpoenas and orders\nseeking documents, testimony\nand other information in\nconnection with various\naspects of their regulated\nactivities. From time to time\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso receive grand jury\nsubpoenas and other requests\nfor information or assistance,\nformal or informal, from\nfederal or state law\nenforcement agencies\nincluding, among others,\nvarious United States\nAttorneys\u2019 Offices, the Asset\nForfeiture and Money\nLaundering Section and other\ndivisions of the Department of\nJustice, the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network of the\nUnited States Department of\nthe Treasury, and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation\nrelating to Citigroup and its\ncustomers. Because of the\nglobal scope of Citigroup\u2019s\noperations and its presence in\ncountries around the world,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nare subject to litigation and\ngovernmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-\ngathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal) in\nmultiple jurisdictions with\nlegal, regulatory and tax\nregimes that may differ\nsubstantially, and present\nsubstantially different risks,\nfrom those Citigroup and\nRelated Parties are subject to\nin the United States. In some\ninstances, Citigroup and\nRelated Parties may be\ninvolved in proceedings\ninvolving the same subject\nmatter in multiple\njurisdictions, which may\nresult in overlapping,\ncumulative or inconsistent\noutcomes. Citigroup seeks to\nresolve all litigation,\nregulatory, tax and other\nmatters in the manner\nmanagement believes is in the\nbest interests of Citigroup\nand its shareholders, and\ncontests liability,\nallegations of wrongdoing and,\nwhere applicable, the amount\nof damages or scope of any\npenalties or other relief\nsought as appropriate in each\npending matter.\n                              296                               \nInherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the\nmatters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or\nindeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters\ntypically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and\nsometimes a wide range of business activities, and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 or claimants\u2019 alleged damages frequently are not\nquantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement\nof claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or\nproceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for\nquantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other\nremedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the\nloss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case,\nproceeding or investigation have yielded additional information\nsufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among\nother things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties,\nrulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts\nand engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range\nof factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of\nthe legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court\u2019s\nscheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse\nparty\u2019s, regulator\u2019s or other authority\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or\nyears after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding\nor an investigation before an estimate of the range of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an\nEstimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below,\nCitigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For\nsome of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual\nhas been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and\nreasonably estimable, but an exposure to loss exists in excess\nof the amount accrued. In these cases, the estimate reflects the\nreasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued\namount. For other matters included within this estimation, no\naccrual has been made because a loss, although estimable, is\nbelieved to be reasonably possible, but not probable; in these\ncases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss. As of December 31, 2021, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges\nup to approximately $ 1.5billion in the aggregate. These\nestimates are based on currently available information. As\navailable information changes, the matters for which Citigroup\nis able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition, while many estimates presented in\nfinancial statements and other financial disclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may be subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss\narising from litigation, regulatory and tax proceedings are\nsubject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of\nmaking an estimate, (i) Citigroup may have only preliminary,\nincomplete or inaccurate information about the facts underlying\nthe claim, (ii) its assumptions about the future rulings of the\ncourt, other tribunal or authority on significant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators or other\nauthorities, may prove to be wrong and (iii) the outcomes it is\nattempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of\nstatistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition,\nfrom time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not\naccounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an\noutcome to be remote. For all of these reasons, the amount of\nloss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for\nwhich an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or\nlower than the range of loss included in the estimate. Matters\nas to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made . For other matters\ndisclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able to estimate the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss. Many of these matters\nremain in very preliminary stages (even in some cases where a\nsubstantial period of time has passed since the commencement of\nthe matter), with few or no substantive legal decisions by the\ncourt, tribunal or other authority defining the scope of the\nclaims, the class (if any) or the potentially available damages\nor other exposure, and fact discovery is still in progress or\nhas not yet begun. In many of these matters, Citigroup has not\nyet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its\ndefenses, nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the\nadverse party (whether a regulator, taxing authority or a\nprivate party). For all these reasons, Citigroup cannot at this\ntime estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if\nany, for these matters. Opinion of Management as to Eventual\nOutcome. Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of\nCitigroup\u2019s management, based on current knowledge and after\ntaking into account its current accruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters described in this Note would not likely\nhave a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or\nindeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and\nthe inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse\noutcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time,\nhave a material adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or\nannual periods. ANZ Underwriting Matter On February 11, 2022,\nthe Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions\ndiscontinued the prosecution of charges that were brought\nagainst Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (CGMA)\nand two Citi employees for alleged criminal cartel offenses in\nrelation to CGMA\u2019s role as a joint underwriter and lead manager\nwith other banks in the 2015 institutional share placement by\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ).

As part of the\nresolution, CGMAL agreed to pay a civil penalty of $\n44.6million. Citigroup is cooperating with related\ninvestigations and inquiries by other government and regulatory\nagencies in Asia Pacific countries and elsewhere. Foreign\nExchange Matters Regulatory Actions : Government and regulatory\nagencies in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are conducting\ninvestigations or making inquiries regarding Citigroup\u2019s foreign\nexchange business. Citigroup is cooperating with these and\nrelated investigations and inquiries. Antitrust and Other\nLitigation : In 2018, a number of institutional investors who\nopted out of the previously disclosed August 2018 final\nsettlement filed an action against Citigroup, Citibank,\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) and other defendants,\ncaptioned ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS, ET AL. v. BANK OF AMERICA\nCORP., ET AL., in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York. Plaintiffs allege that defendants\nmanipulated, and colluded to manipulate, the foreign exchange\nmarkets. Plaintiffs assert claims under the Sherman Act and\nunjust enrichment claims, and seek consequential and punitive\ndamages and other forms of relief. On July 28, 2020, plaintiffs\nfiled a third amended complaint. Additional information\nconcerning this action is publicly available in court filings\nunder the docket number 18-CV-10364 (S.D.N.Y.) (Schofield, J.).\nIn 2018, a group of institutional investors issued a claim\nagainst Citigroup, Citibank and other defendants, captioned\nALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS GMBH AND OTHERS v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC\nAND OTHERS, in the High Court of Justice in London. Claimants\nallege that defendants manipulated, and colluded to manipulate,\nthe foreign exchange market in violation of EU and U.K.\ncompetition laws. In December 2021, the High Court ordered that\nthe case be transferred to the U.K.\u2019s Competition Appeal\nTribunal. Additional information concerning this action is\npublicly available in court filings under the case number\nCL-2018-000840 in the High Court and under the case number\n1430/5/7/22 (T) in the Competition Appeal Tribunal. In 2015, a\nputative class of consumers and businesses in the U.S. who\ndirectly purchased supracompetitive foreign currency at\nbenchmark exchange rates filed an action against Citigroup and\nother defendants, captioned NYPL v. JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., ET\nAL., in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California (later transferred to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York).\nSubsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint\nagainst Citigroup, Citibank and Citicorp as defendants.\nPlaintiffs allege that they suffered losses as a result of\ndefendants\u2019 alleged manipulation of, and collusion with respect\nto, the foreign exchange market. Plaintiffs assert claims under\nfederal and California antitrust and consumer protection laws,\nand seek compensatory damages, treble damages and declaratory\nand injunctive relief.

Interbank Offered Rates-Related Litigation\nIn May 2019, three putative class actions filed against\nCitigroup, Citibank, CGMI and other defendants were\nconsolidated, under the caption IN RE ICE LIBOR ANTITRUST\nLITIGATION, in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. Plaintiffs allege that defendants\nsuppressed ICE LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert\n                              298                               \nclaims under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and unjust\nenrichment, and seek compensatory damages, disgorgement, and\ntreble damages. In March 2020, the court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, which\nplaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit. Additional information concerning this\naction is publicly available in court filings under the docket\nnumbers 19-CV-439 (S.D.N.Y.) (Daniels, J.) and 20-1492 (2d\nCir.). In August 2020, individual borrowers and consumers of\nloans and credit cards filed an action against Citigroup,\nCitibank, CGMI and other defendants, captioned MCCARTHY, ET AL.\nv. INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE, INC., ET AL., in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California.\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix ICE LIBOR,\nassert claims under the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, and\nseek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and treble damages.\nAdditional information concerning this action is publicly\navailable in court filings under the docket number 20-CV-5832\n(N.D. Cal.) (Donato, J.). Interchange Fee Litigation Beginning\nin 2005, several putative class actions were filed against\nCitigroup, Citibank and Citicorp, together with Visa, MasterCard\nand other banks and their affiliates, in various federal\ndistrict courts and consolidated with other related individual\ncases in a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York. This\nproceeding is captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND\nMERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The plaintiffs,\nmerchants that accept Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards,\nand various membership associations that claim to represent\ncertain groups of merchants, allege, among other things, that\ndefendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of\ninterchange and merchant discount fees on credit and debit card\ntransactions and to restrain trade unreasonably through various\nVisa and MasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in\nviolation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California\nstatutes. Plaintiffs further alleged violations of Section 2 of\nthe Sherman Act. Supplemental complaints also were filed against\ndefendants in the putative class actions alleging that Visa\u2019s\nand MasterCard\u2019s respective initial public offerings were\nanticompetitive and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and\nthat MasterCard\u2019s initial public offering constituted a\nfraudulent conveyance. In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed\nthe district court\u2019s approval of a class settlement and remanded\nfor further proceedings. The district court thereafter appointed\nseparate interim counsel for a putative class seeking damages\nand a putative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended or new\ncomplaints on behalf of the putative classes and various\nindividual merchants were subsequently filed, including a\nfurther amended complaint on behalf of a putative damages class\nand a new complaint on behalf of a putative injunctive class,\nboth of which named Citigroup and Related Parties. In addition,\nnumerous merchants have filed amended or new complaints against\nVisa, MasterCard, and in some instances one or more issuing\nbanks, including Citigroup and affiliates. In 2019, the district\ncourt granted the damages class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for final\napproval of a new settlement with the defendants. The settlement\ninvolves the damages class only and does not settle the claims\nof the injunctive relief class or any actions brought on a non-\nclass basis by individual merchants. The settlement provides for\na cash payment to the damages class of $ 6.24billion, later\nreduced by $ 700million based on the transaction volume of class\nmembers that opted out from the settlement. Several merchants\nand merchant groups have appealed the final approval order. On\nSeptember 27, 2021, the court granted the injunctive relief\nclass plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify a non-opt-out class.\nAdditional information concerning these consolidated actions is\npublicly available in court filings under the docket number MDL\n05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Brodie, J.). Interest Rate and Credit\nDefault Swap Matters Regulatory Actions : The Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (CFTC) is conducting an investigation into\nalleged anticompetitive conduct in the trading and clearing of\ninterest rate swaps (IRS) by investment banks. Citigroup is\ncooperating with the investigation. Antitrust and Other\nLitigation : Beginning in 2015, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML\nand numerous other parties were named as defendants in a number\nof industry-wide putative class actions related to IRS trading.\nThese actions have been consolidated in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York under the\ncaption IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The\nactions allege that defendants colluded to prevent the\ndevelopment of exchange-like trading for IRS and assert federal\nand state antitrust claims and claims for unjust enrichment.\nAlso consolidated under the same caption are individual actions\nfiled by swap execution facilities, asserting federal and state\nantitrust claims, as well as claims for unjust enrichment and\ntortious interference with business relations. Plaintiffs in\nthese actions seek treble damages, fees, costs and injunctive\nrelief. Lead plaintiffs in the class action moved for class\ncertification in 2019, and subsequently filed an amended\ncomplaint. Additional information concerning these actions is\npublicly available in court filings under the docket numbers\n18-CV-5361 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.) and 16-MD-2704 (S.D.N.Y.)\n(Oetken, J.). In 2017, Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI, CGML and\nnumerous other parties were named as defendants in an action\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York under the caption TERA GROUP, INC., ET AL.\nv. CITIGROUP, INC., ET AL. The complaint alleges that defendants\ncolluded to prevent the development of exchange-like trading for\ncredit default swaps and asserts federal and state antitrust\nclaims and state law tort claims. In January 2020, plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint, which defendants later moved to\ndismiss.

Amounts reclassified for\neach quarter were $ 295million for 4Q21, $ 293million for 3Q21,\n$ 279million for 2Q21, $ 340million for 1Q21, $ 333million for\n4Q20, $ 375million for 3Q20, $ 270million for 2Q20 and $\n225million for 1Q20.

In addition, due to averaging of shares, quarterly\nearnings per share may not sum to the totals reported for the\nfull year.\n     End of Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to      \n               Consolidated Financial Statements                \n                                                                \n                              314                               \nFINANCIAL DATA SUPPLEMENT\nRATIOS\n                                                                \n                                 2021       2020       2019     \n  Return on average assets       0.94  %    0.50  %    0.98  %  \n  Return on average common                                      \n  stockholders\u2019                  11.5        5.7       10.3     \n  equity(1)                                                     \n  Return on average total                                       \n  stockholders\u2019                  10.9        5.7        9.9     \n  equity(2)                                                     \n  Total average equity to                                       \n  average                         8.6        8.7        9.9     \n  assets(3)                                                     \n  Dividend payout ratio(4)         20         43         24     \n                                                                \n(1) Based on Citigroup\u2019s net\nincome less preferred stock\ndividends as a percentage of\naverage common stockholders\u2019\nequity.

Citi is also\nsubject to anti-money\nlaundering and financial\ntransparency laws, including\nstandards for verifying client\nidentification at account\nopening and obligations to\nmonitor client transactions\nand report suspicious\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Securities and Commodities Regulation                         \n                                                                \nCiti conducts securities\nunderwriting, brokerage and\ndealing activities in the U.S.\nthrough Citigroup Global\nMarkets Inc. (CGMI), its\nprimary broker-dealer, and\nother broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, which are\nsubject to regulations of the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC), the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority and certain\nexchanges. Citi conducts\nsimilar securities activities\noutside the U.S., subject to\nlocal requirements, through\nvarious subsidiaries and\naffiliates, principally\nCitigroup Global Markets\nLimited in London (CGML),\nwhich is regulated principally\nby the U.K.\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority\nand Prudential Regulation\nAuthority (PRA), and Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Japan Inc. in\nTokyo, which is regulated\nprincipally by the Financial\nServices Agency of Japan.\n\nCiti also has subsidiaries\nthat are members of futures\nexchanges and derivatives\nclearinghouses. In the U.S.,\nCGMI is a member of the\nprincipal U.S. futures\nexchanges and clearinghouses,\nand Citi has subsidiaries that\nare registered as futures\ncommission merchants and\ncommodity pool operators with\nthe Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (CFTC). Citibank,\nCGMI, Citigroup Energy Inc.,\nCitigroup Global Markets\nEurope AG (CGME) and CGML are\nalso registered as swap\ndealers with the CFTC (for\nadditional information, see\nbelow). CGMI is also subject\nto SEC and CFTC rules that\nspecify uniform minimum net\ncapital requirements.\nCompliance with these rules\ncould limit those operations\nof CGMI that require the\nintensive use of capital and\nalso limits the ability of\nbroker-dealers to transfer\nlarge amounts of capital to\nparent companies and other\naffiliates. See \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d and Note 18 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for a further\ndiscussion of capital\nconsiderations of Citi\u2019s non-\nbanking subsidiaries.\n\nRecent Rules Regarding Swap\nDealers/Security-Based Swap\n\nDealers\n\nOn July 22, 2020, the CFTC\nadopted final rules\nestablishing\n\ncapital and financial\nreporting requirements for\nswap dealers\n\nthat took effect in October\n2021.\n\nIn addition, the SEC has\nadopted rules governing the\n\nregistration and regulation of\nsecurity-based swap dealers.\nThe\n\nregulations include\nrequirements related to (i)\ncapital, margin\n\nand segregation, (ii) record-\nkeeping, reporting and\nnotification\n\nand (iii) risk management\npractices for uncleared\nsecurity based swaps and the\ncross-border application of\ncertain\n\nsecurity-based swap\nrequirements. These\nrequirements also\n\ntook effect in November 2021.\nCitibank, CGML and CGME\nregistered with the SEC as\nsecurities-based swap dealers.\n                                                                \n  Transactions with Affiliates                                  \n                                                                \nTransactions between Citi\u2019s\nU.S. subsidiary depository\ninstitutions and their non-\nbank affiliates are regulated\nby the FRB, and are generally\nrequired to be on arm\u2019s-length\nterms.

Citi\u2019s\ncompetitors include a variety\nof financial services and\nadvisory companies, as well as\ncertain non-financial services\nfirms. Citi competes for\nclients and capital (including\ndeposits and funding in the\nshort- and long-term debt\nmarkets) with some of these\ncompetitors globally and with\nothers on a regional or\nproduct basis. Citi\u2019s\ncompetitive position depends\non many factors, including,\namong others, the value of\nCiti\u2019s brand name, reputation,\nthe types of clients and\ngeographies served; the\nquality, range, performance,\ninnovation and pricing of\nproducts and services; the\neffectiveness of and access to\ndistribution channels,\nmaintenance of partner\nrelationships, emerging\ntechnologies and technology\nadvances, customer\n                              316                               \nservice and convenience; the\neffectiveness of transaction\nexecution, interest rates,\nlending limits and risk\nappetite; regulatory\nconstraints and compliance;\nand changes in the\nmacroeconomic business\nenvironment or societal norms.\nCiti\u2019s ability to compete\neffectively also depends upon\nits ability to attract new\ncolleagues and retain and\nmotivate existing colleagues,\nwhile managing compensation\nand other costs.
