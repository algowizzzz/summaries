Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts of\napproximately $1 billion,\nprimarily consisting of a gain\nfrom the sale of the India\nconsumer business in the\nprior-year period, revenues\nincreased 3%, driven by growth\nacross Banking , U.S. Personal\nBanking ( USPB ) and Services\n, partially offset by declines\nin Markets and Wealth .\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased 7%\nversus the prior-year period.\nThe increase included\nrepositioning costs of $258\nmillion, an incremental FDIC\nspecial assessment of $251\nmillion and net restructuring\ncharges of $225 million.\nExcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts in both the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod and the incremental\nFDIC special assessment,\nexpenses increased 5%, largely\ndriven by inflation and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings (see\n\u201cExpenses\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\napproximately $2.4 billion\nversus $2.0 billion in the\nprior-year period. The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby higher cards net credit\nlosses in Branded Cards and\nRetail Services in USPB ,\nlargely reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of cards\nloan vintages originated\nduring the pandemic, as well\nas the impact of the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment, partially offset\nby a lower build in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) in the current quarter\n(see \u201cCost of Credit\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $1.5 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends ($1.0\nbillion) and share repurchases\n($0.5 billion).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach was 13.5% as of March\n31, 2024 (compared to 13.4% as\nof March 31, 2023) (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below).\nThis compares to Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio of 12.3% as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and 12.0% as of\nMarch 31, 2023 under the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress with the wind-downs\nof the Korea and China\nconsumer banking businesses\nand the Russia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbusinesses, as well as the\nseparation involving Citi\u2019s\nconsumer banking and small\nbusiness and middle-market\nbanking operations in Mexico\nin preparation for a planned\ninitial public offering in\n2025.\n                                                                \n  First Quarter of 2024 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. Net income decreased\n27% versus the prior-year\nperiod, driven by the higher\nexpenses, the higher cost of\ncredit and the lower revenues.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas approximately 25% in both\nthe current and prior-year\nperiods. Average diluted\nshares outstanding decreased\n1%.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $21.1\nbillion in the first quarter\nof 2024 decreased 2% versus\nthe prior-year period on a\nreported basis. Excluding the\ndivestiture-related impacts in\nboth quarters, primarily\nconsisting of the gain from\nthe sale of the India consumer\nbusiness in the prior-year\nperiod, revenues of $21.1\nbillion increased 3%, driven\nby growth across Banking ,\nUSPB and Services , partially\noffset by declines in Markets\nand Wealth . (For additional\ninformation on the\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nsee \u201c All Other \u2014Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling\nItems)\u201d below.) (As used\nthroughout this Form 10-Q,\nCiti\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.) Banking revenues\nreflected a recovery of the\nglobal investment banking\nwallet, Services revenues were\ndriven by higher revenues in\nboth Treasury and Trade\nSolutions (TTS) and Securities\nServices and USPB revenues\nbenefited from strong loan\ngrowth in cards. The decline\nin Markets revenues was\nprimarily due to lower Fixed\nIncome markets revenues, while\nWealth revenues were largely\nimpacted by higher mortgage\nfunding costs and lower\ndeposit spreads.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $675 billion, up 3%\nversus the prior-year period,\nlargely reflecting the growth\nin cards and mortgages in USPB\nand higher loans in Markets .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, down 2% versus\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndue to a reduction in Services\n, reflecting quantitative\ntightening.

As\ndiscussed above, results for\nthe first quarter of 2024\nincluded the following notable\nitems recorded in operating\nexpenses in Corporate/Other\nwithin All Other (managed\nbasis):\n\n\u2022 $251 million charge to\noperating expenses related to\nthe FDIC\u2019s notification to\nCiti that it had increased its\nestimated loss attributable to\nthe protection of uninsured\ndepositors at Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank (see\nNote 27)\n\n\u2022 $225 million of net\nrestructuring charges related\nto actions taken as part of\nCiti\u2019s organizational\nsimplification initiatives\n(see Note 9)\n                               4                                \nIn the first quarter of 2024,\nexpenses also included\nrepositioning costs of $258\nmillion and divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $110\nmillion (compared to $73\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod). Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts in\nboth periods and the\nincremental FDIC special\nassessment, expenses increased\n5% versus the prior-year\nperiod, driven by inflation\nand volume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings. (As used\nthroughout this Form 10-Q,\nCiti\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts and the incremental\nFDIC special assessment are\nnon-GAAP financial measures.)\n\nAs previously announced, Citi\nexpects to incur additional\nrepositioning costs during the\nremainder of 2024.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $2.4\nbillion, compared to $2.0\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher net\ncredit losses in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services, largely\nreflecting continued\nmaturation of cards loan\nvintages originated during the\npandemic, with delayed losses\ndue to unprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus, as well\nas macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios, partially\noffset by a lower build in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL). For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $2.3\nbillion increased 77% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $2.1\nbillion increased 67%, largely\nreflecting the rise in cards\nnet credit loss rates.\nCorporate net credit losses\nincreased to $164 million from\n$22 million.\n\nAs previously announced, Citi\nexpects full-year net credit\nloss rates for both Branded\nCards and Retail Services to\nbe higher in 2024. The higher\nnet credit loss expectations\nare already reflected in the\nACL on loans for outstanding\nbalances at March 31, 2024.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nincreased modestly to 13.5% as\nof March 31, 2024, compared to\n13.4% as of March 31, 2023,\nbased on the Basel III\nStandardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets (RWA). The increase was\nprimarily driven by net\nincome, interest rate impacts\non Citigroup\u2019s investment\nportfolio, impacts from the\nsales of certain Asia consumer\nbanking (Asia Consumer)\nbusinesses and a decrease in\nRWA, partially offset by the\npayment of common dividends\nand share repurchases and\nhigher disallowed deferred tax\nassets.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024,\nCiti repurchased $0.5 billion\nof common shares and paid $1.0\nbillion of common dividends\n(see \u201cUnregistered Sales of\nEquity Securities, Repurchases\nof Equity Securities and\nDividends\u201d below). Citi will\ncontinue to assess common\nshare repurchases on a\nquarterly basis given\nuncertainty regarding\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.

Cost of\ncredit was $64 million,\ncompared to a net benefit of\n$14 million in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nServices revenues of $4.8\nbillion increased 8%, largely\ndriven by continued momentum\nacross TTS and Securities\nServices. Net interest income\nincreased 6%, driven by higher\ndeposit and trade loan\nspreads, and non-interest\nrevenue increased 14%, largely\ndriven by continued strength\nacross underlying fee drivers.\n\nTTS revenues of $3.5 billion\nincreased 5%, driven by a 4%\nincrease in net interest\nincome, primarily driven by\nhigher spreads, and a 9%\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue, reflecting continued\ngrowth in underlying drivers,\nincluding cross-border\nvolumes, U.S. dollar clearing\nvolumes and commercial card\nspend.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $1.3 billion increased 18%,\ndriven by a 16% increase in\nnet interest income on higher\ndeposit spreads, and a 21%\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue, primarily driven by\nhigher assets under custody\nand administration (AUC/AUA)\nbalances from higher market\nvaluations, as well as new\nclient onboarding, and\nelevated corporate activity in\nIssuer Services.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nServices in the first quarter\nof 2024, see \u201c Services \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Markets                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets net income of $1.4\nbillion decreased 25% from the\nprior-year period, driven by\nlower revenues, higher\nexpenses and higher cost of\ncredit. Markets expenses of\n$3.4 billion increased 7%,\nlargely driven by the absence\nof a legal reserve release in\nthe prior-year period. Cost of\ncredit increased to $200\nmillion from $83 million in\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting a higher net ACL\nbuild, primarily driven by\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariable assumptions related\nto loans in spread products,\nand higher net credit losses.\n\nMarkets revenues of $5.4\nbillion decreased 7%, driven\nby a 10% decrease in Fixed\nIncome markets, partially\noffset by a 5% increase in\nEquity markets. The decrease\nin Fixed Income markets was\nlargely driven by a decline in\nrates and currencies, largely\nreflecting lower volatility,\ndecreased institutional client\nactivity and a strong prior-\nyear comparison, partially\noffset by strength in spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome, up 26%, primarily\nreflecting an increase in\nclient\n                               5                                \nactivity.

Banking expenses of\n$1.2 billion decreased 4%,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nfrom repositioning actions and\nother actions to lower the\nexpense base, partially offset\nby business-led investments.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.7\nbillion increased 49%, driven\nby growth in Investment\nBanking and Corporate Lending,\nas well as lower losses on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nlosses on loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $1.8 billion\nincreased 35%. Investment\nBanking revenues increased\n35%, driven by the Debt\nCapital Markets (DCM) and\nEquity Capital Markets (ECM)\nbusinesses, as improved market\nsentiment led to an increase\nin issuance activity. This\nincrease in revenues was\npartially offset by lower\nAdvisory revenues, reflecting\nthe impact of lower merger\nactivity announced in the\nsecond half of 2023. Corporate\nLending revenues increased\n68%, including the impact of\nlosses on loan hedges.\nExcluding the losses on loan\nhedges, Corporate Lending\nrevenues increased 34%,\nlargely driven by higher\nrevenue share.

Cost of credit\nof $185 million decreased 59%,\nlargely driven by the absence\nof a net ACL build in the\nprior-year period, partially\noffset by higher net credit\nlosses in Mexico Consumer.\n\nAll Other (managed basis)\nrevenues decreased 9% from the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by higher funding costs\nin Corporate/Other.\n\nLegacy Franchises (managed\nbasis) revenues of $1.8\nbillion were largely unchanged\nfrom the prior-year period, as\nhigher revenues in Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM (managed basis),\nmainly due to higher volumes\nand Mexican peso appreciation,\nwere offset by lower revenues\nin Asia Consumer (managed\nbasis), reflecting the impacts\nof the closed exits and wind-\ndowns.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nAll Other (managed basis) in\nthe first quarter of 2024, see\n\u201c All Other \u2014Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling\nItems)\u201d and \u201c All Other\n(Managed Basis)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and regulatory\nchallenges and uncertainties\ncontinue to adversely affect\neconomic conditions in the\nU.S. and globally, including,\namong others, continued\nelevated interest rates and\ninflation, and economic and\ngeopolitical challenges\nrelated to China, the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war and\nescalating conflicts in the\nMiddle East.

and cost of credit.\n\nRevenues increased 8%, driven\nby higher revenues in both TTS\nand Securities Services,\nlargely driven by both net\ninterest income and non-\ninterest revenue growth.\n\nTTS revenues increased 5%,\nreflecting 4% growth in net\ninterest income and 9%\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue. The increase in net\ninterest income was primarily\ndriven by higher spreads,\npartially offset by lower\ndeposits. The growth in non-\ninterest revenue was largely\ndriven by continued strength\nacross underlying fee drivers,\nincluding higher cross-border\nflows (up 9%), U.S. dollar\nclearing volumes (up 3%) and\ncommercial card spend (up 5%).\nAverage deposits were down 3%,\nas the impact of quantitative\ntightening more than offset\nnew client acquisitions and\ndeepening with existing\nclients.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nincreased 18%, due to 16%\ngrowth in net interest income,\ndriven by higher deposit\nspreads, and 21% growth in\nnon-interest revenue. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by fee\ngrowth, primarily due to\nhigher AUC/AUA balances from\nhigher market valuations, as\nwell as new client onboarding\nalong with continued elevated\nlevels of corporate activity\nin Issuer Services.\n\nExpenses were up 11%,\nprimarily driven by\ninvestments in technology,\nother risk and controls and\nproduct innovation.\n\nProvisions were $64 million,\ncompared to $(14) million in\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by an ACL\nbuild for loans, compared to a\nrelease in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nThe net ACL build was\nprimarily due to changes in\nloan portfolio mix.

The range of services includes market-\nmaking across asset classes, risk management solutions,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and\nsettlement.\n\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including\nholding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the\ndifferential between the price at which it buys and sells the\nproducts. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and\nlosses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions .\nOther primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity\nsecurities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring\ngains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less\ninterest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding\ntransactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest\nincome.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market variables such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor\nconfidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues\ninclude revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue\nsharing arrangement with Banking \u2014Corporate Lending for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in\nclient activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. Management of the\nMarkets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of\nthe above factors.\n\nMarkets international presence is supported by trading floors in\napproximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95\ncountries and jurisdictions.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n

Rates and\ncurrencies revenues decreased\n21%, largely reflecting lower\nvolatility, decreased\ninstitutional client activity\nand a strong prior-year\nperformance. Spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues increased 26%, driven\nby spread products, primarily\ndue to increased client\nactivity, particularly in\nasset-backed lending. The\nincrease was partially offset\nby a decline in commodities\nrevenues.\n\nEquity markets revenues\nincreased 5%, driven by growth\nin cash equity trading, due to\nhigher volumes and increased\ntrading activity, and higher\nequity derivatives revenues,\ndue to increased corporate\nclient activity. Equity\nmarkets also continued to\nexperience an increase in\nprime balances.\n\nExpenses increased 7%,\nprimarily driven by the\nabsence of a legal reserve\nrelease in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nProvisions were $200 million,\ncompared to $83 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by a\nnet ACL build of $122 million,\ncompared to $79 million in the\nprior-year period, and net\ncredit losses of $78 million,\ncompared to $4 million in the\nprior-year period. The net ACL\nbuild was primarily driven by\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariable assumptions related\nto loans in spread products.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see

Gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by\nthe mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market\non credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate\nloan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of these hedges\nare netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the\ncost of credit protection.

DCM underwriting\nfees increased 62%, driven by\nelevated debt issuance\nactivity, particularly\ninvestment grade. ECM\nunderwriting fees increased\n57%, primarily driven by an\nincrease in convertibles\nissuance. The increase in DCM\nand ECM underwriting fees was\npartially offset by lower\nAdvisory fees (down 17%),\ndriven by the impact of low\nmerger activity announced in\nthe second half of 2023.\n\nCorporate Lending revenues\nincreased 68%, including the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof losses on loan hedges,\nCorporate Lending revenues\nincreased 34%, largely driven\nby higher revenue share.\n\nExpenses decreased 4%,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nfrom repositioning actions and\nother actions to lower the\nexpense base, partially offset\nby business-led investments.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $129 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $123 million in the\nprior-year period. Net credit\nlosses increased to $66\nmillion, compared to $12\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL release\nwas $195 million, compared to\na net release of $135 million\nin the prior-year\n\nperiod, primarily driven by\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition.

million in\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting higher cost of\ncredit, partially offset by\nhigher revenues.\n\nRevenues increased 10%, due to\nhigher net interest income (up\n8%), largely driven by strong\nloan growth in cards, as well\nas higher non-interest revenue\n(up 66%). The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was largely\ndriven by lower partner\npayments in Retail Services,\ndue to higher net credit\nlosses.\n\nCards revenues increased 11%.\nBranded Cards revenues\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby the higher net interest\nincome, reflecting the strong\nloan growth. Branded Cards\naverage loans increased 11%,\nreflecting the higher card\nspend volumes and lower card\npayment rates. Branded Cards\ncard spend volumes increased\n4%, driven by more affluent\ncustomers.\n\nRetail Services revenues\nincreased 18%, primarily\ndriven by higher non-interest\nrevenue due to the lower\npartner payments, driven by\nhigher net credit losses (see\n\u201cProvisions\u201d below and Note\n5), as well as higher net\ninterest income on higher loan\nbalances. Retail Services\naverage loans increased 6%,\nlargely reflecting lower card\npayment rates, and credit card\nspend volumes decreased 4%,\nprimarily due to lower in-\nstore foot traffic.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\nincreased 1%, primarily driven\nby the higher deposit spreads,\nloan growth and improved\nmortgage margins, largely\noffset by the impact of the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth . Average mortgage\nloans increased 18%, primarily\ndriven by lower refinancings\ndue to high interest rates and\nmortgage originations\nexceeding prepayments. Average\ndeposits decreased 10%,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth ($16 billion over the\nlast 12 months).\n\nExpenses were largely\nunchanged, as lower\ncompensation costs were offset\nby higher repositioning costs\nand volume-related expenses.\n\nProvisions were $2.2 billion,\ncompared to $1.6 billion in\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndriven by higher net credit\nlosses, partially offset by a\nlower ACL build for loans. Net\ncredit losses increased 74%,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of cards\nloan vintages originated\nduring the pandemic, with\ndelayed losses due to\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus, as well\nas macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios. Branded\nCards net credit losses were\nup 87% to $1 billion and\nRetail Services net credit\nlosses were up 65% to $0.8\nbillion.\n\nThe net ACL build was $0.3\nbillion, compared to $0.6\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL build in\nthe current quarter primarily\nreflected the impact of\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment and the seasonal\nmix shift from transactors to\nrevolvers, partially offset by\nlower end-of-period cards\nbalances.

largely offset\nby lower cost of credit.\n\nRevenues decreased 4%, largely\ndriven by lower net interest\nincome (down 13%), due to\nlower deposit spreads and\nhigher mortgage funding costs.\nThe decrease in revenues was\npartially offset by an\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue (up 11%), largely\ndriven by higher investment\nfee revenues.\n\nClient balances increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by higher\nclient investment assets (up\n12%) across regions,\nreflecting the benefit of\nhigher market valuations and\nnet new investment asset\nflows.\n\nAverage loans were largely\nunchanged, as the business\ncontinued to optimize\nregulatory capital usage.\nAverage deposits decreased 1%,\nprimarily reflecting lower\ndeposits in Private Bank and\nWealth at Work and the\ncontinued transfers to higher-\nyielding investments on Citi\u2019s\nplatform. This decrease in\ndeposits was largely offset by\nthe transfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances\nfrom USPB ($16 billion over\nthe last 12 months).\n\nPrivate Bank revenues\nincreased 1%, primarily driven\nby improved deposit spreads\nand investment fee revenues,\nlargely offset by higher\nmortgage funding costs.\n\nWealth at Work revenues\ndecreased 6%, driven by the\nlower deposit spreads and the\nhigher mortgage funding costs,\npartially offset by the higher\ninvestment fee revenues.\n\nCitigold revenues decreased\n6%, driven by the lower\ndeposit spreads, partially\noffset by the higher\ninvestment fee revenues and\nhigher deposit volumes.\n\nExpenses increased 3%,\nprimarily driven by technology\ninvestments focused on risk\nand controls and platform\nenhancements, partially offset\nby initial benefits from\nrepositioning and\nrestructuring actions.\n\nProvisions were a benefit of\n$170 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $58 million in the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by a higher net ACL\nrelease.\n\nThe higher net ACL release was\nprimarily driven by a change\nin ACL associated with the\nmargin lending portfolio.

The\ncapital proposal would also\nreplace the current market\nrisk framework with a new\nstandardized methodology and a\nnew models-based methodology\nfor calculating risk-weighted\nassets for market risk. Large\nbanking organizations, such as\nCiti, would be required to\ncalculate their risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized\nApproach and use the lower of\nthe two for each risk-based\ncapital ratio for determining\nthe binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nasset amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nrisk-weighted asset amounts\nwould also affect several\nother requirements including\nTLAC, external long-term debt\nand the short-term wholesale\nfunding score included in the\nGSIB surcharge under method 2\n(see \u201cGSIB Surcharge\u201d below).\nThe proposal has a three-year\ntransition period that would\nbegin on July 1, 2025.

In\naddition, the proposal would\nnarrow surcharge bands under\nmethod 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps\nto reduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the\nFederal Reserve Board issued a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking\nto amend the TLAC rule to\nchange the haircuts (i.e., the\npercentage reductions) that\nare applied to eligible long-\nterm debt. Under the proposed\nrule, only 50% of eligible\nlong-term debt with a maturity\nof one year or more but less\nthan two years would count\ntoward the TLAC requirement,\ninstead of the current 100%.\nThese proposed revisions are\nestimated to decrease the TLAC\npercentage of Advanced\nApproaches RWA as well as the\nTLAC percentage of Total\nLeverage Exposure. The\nproposed rule in its current\nform has no proposed\ntransition period for its\nimplementation and is not\nexpected to be material to\nCiti.\n                               37                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)). Return on tangible\ncommon equity (RoTCE)\nrepresents annualized net\nincome available to common\nshareholders as a percentage\nof average TCE. Tangible book\nvalue per share (TBVPS)\nrepresents average TCE divided\nby average common shares\noutstanding. Other companies\nmay calculate these measures\ndifferently.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of March 31,\n2024. Citi has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been observed.\n                               41                               \nAs obligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe first quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nUSPB increased quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of cards\nloan vintages originated\nduring the pandemic, with\ndelayed losses due to\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus as well as\nthe macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios.\n                 \n  Branded Cards  \n                 \nUSPB \u2019s Branded Cards\nportfolio includes proprietary\nand co-branded cards. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe first quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nBranded Cards increased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily\nreflecting the continued\nmaturation of cards loan\nvintages originated during the\npandemic, with delayed losses\ndue to unprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus as well as\nthe impact of macroeconomic\npressures related to the\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios.\n                   \n  Retail Services  \n                   \nUSPB \u2019s Retail Services\npartners directly with more\nthan 20 retailers and dealers\nto offer private label and co-\nbranded cards.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 14. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe net credit loss rate in\nRetail Banking for the first\nquarter of 2024 increased\nquarter-over-quarter, driven\nby consumer overdraft loans,\nand was broadly stable year-\nover-year. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nlower delinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nAs indicated above, Wealth\nprovides consumer mortgages,\nmargin lending, cards and\nother lending products to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom affluent to ultra-high\nnet worth through the Private\nBank, Wealth at Work and\nCitigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies and\nincludes loans that are\ndelinquency managed or\nclassifiably managed. The\ndelinquency-managed portfolio\nconsists primarily of\nmortgages, margin lending and\ncards.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024,\napproximately $44 billion, or\n30%, of the portfolios were\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 81% is rated\ninvestment grade. While the\ndelinquency rate in the chart\nabove is calculated only for\nthe delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe first quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nWealth was broadly stable\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year. The low net credit\nloss and 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolio.\n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a more\nmass-market segment in Mexico\nand focuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As presented\nin the chart above, the first\nquarter of 2024 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of loss rates\nfrom post-pandemic lows. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate was broadly stable\nquarter-over-quarter and\nincreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the\nongoing normalization from\npost-pandemic lows.

The FICO\ndistribution of both card\nportfolios declined slightly\nfrom the prior quarter and the\nprior year, primarily\nreflecting continued\nmaturation of cards loan\nvintages originated during the\npandemic, as well as\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios. The FICO\ndistribution continued to\nreflect strong underlying\ncredit quality of the\nportfolios.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $64 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $80 million ($0.6 billion) at March 31, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $66 million, $73 million and $57 million at March\n31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail\nServices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status and therefore,\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March\n31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, 81%, 85% and 93%\nof Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment\ngrade. For additional information on the credit quality of the\nWealth portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see\n\u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and\nRussia for all periods presented.\n\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nConsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and, hence, the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nmost recent reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and\nIndonesia in 1Q22; Taiwan closed in 3Q23 and Indonesia closed in\n4Q23. In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the\nfirst quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second\nquarter of 2023. See Note 2.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n                               50                               \n(EOP loans) were $66 million ($0.2 billion), $67 million ($0.2\nbillion) and $81 million ($0.3 billion) at March 31, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $33 million, $36 million and $30

Corporate non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 61%, 50%, 62%, 51% and 61% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal\npayments at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, September 30,\n2023, June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n(3) The March 31, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.51% of total corporate loans.\n\n(4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to\ntwo commercial real estate loans.\n\n(5) Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all\nperiods presented.\n                               56                               \nThe changes in Citigroup\u2019s non-accrual loans were as follows:\n                                                                \n           Th\u2026                           T\u2026                     \n           Mo\u2026                           M\u2026                     \n           En\u2026                           E\u2026                     \n           Ma\u2026                           M\u2026                     \n           31,                           3\u2026                     \n           20\u2026                           2\u2026                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026       Co\u2026       Co\u2026       To\u2026       C\u2026       Co\u2026       T\u2026  \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  N\u2026                                                            \n  l\u2026                                                            \n  at    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2\u2026  \n  b\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  q\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026       238       418       656       4\u2026       442       8\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026                                                            \n  t\u2026       -2\u2026        -4       -2\u2026       -\u2026        -6       -\u2026  \n  to                                                            \n  H\u2026                                                            \n  R\u2026                                                            \n  to        -2       -57       -59       -\u2026       -48       -\u2026  \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  P\u2026       -3\u2026       -1\u2026       -4\u2026       -\u2026       -1\u2026       -\u2026  \n  C\u2026       -1\u2026       -2\u2026       -3\u2026       -\u2026       -1\u2026       -\u2026  \n  O\u2026        -2       -32       -34       -8        18       10  \n  E\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  2\u2026  \n  b\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \nThe table below summarizes Citigroup\u2019s other real estate owned\n(OREO) assets.

In general, a\nbank\u2019s available stable\nfunding includes portions of\nequity, deposits and long-term\ndebt, while its required\nstable funding will be based\non the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings are\nrequired to be applied to the\nvarious asset and liability\nclasses.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup) and Citi\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\n(including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated\ninto Citigroup. As of March 31, 2024, non-bank included $89.4\nbillion of long-term debt issued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer and\nother subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain\nCitigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in\nthis line. (2) Local country and other includes debt issued by\nCiti\u2019s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within\nnon-bank, certain secured financing is also included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by\nBranded Cards receivables.\n\nCiti\u2019s total long-term debt outstanding increased 2% year-over-\nyear, largely driven by issuance of subordinated debt in the\nnon-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark debt\nand FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially\noffset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the non-bank\nentities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding was largely\nunchanged. As part of its liability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market\npurchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and\nrepurchases help reduce Citi\u2019s overall funding costs. During the\nfirst quarter of 2024, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate\nof approximately $9.4 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.\n                               60

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $299\nbillion as of March 31, 2024\nincreased 16% year-over-year\nand 8% sequentially, largely\ndriven by additional financing\nto support increases in\ntrading-related assets within\nCiti\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. As of the\nquarter ended March 31, 2024,\non an average basis, secured\nfunding was $311 billion. The\nportion of secured funding in\nthe broker-dealer subsidiaries\nthat funds secured lending is\ncommonly referred to as\n\u201cmatched book\u201d activity and is\nprimarily secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other \u201cmatched\nbook\u201d activity is secured by\nless liquid securities,\nincluding equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-\nbacked securities, the tenor\nof which is generally equal to\nor longer than the tenor of\nthe corresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $32 billion as of March 31,\n2024 decreased 21% year-over-\nyear and 15% sequentially,\nboth reflecting lower\ncommercial paper issuances at\nthe broker-dealer subsidiaries\n(see Note 18 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               62                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of March 31, 2024.\nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of March 31,\n2024, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.6 billion, compared to $0.5\nbillion as of December 31,\n2023. As detailed under \u201cHigh-\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of March 31,\n2024, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$11.1 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits (compared to $11.0\nbillion at December 31, 2023)\n(see Note 21).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               63                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market-implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas) are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa. Citi manages EVS\nwithin risk limits approved by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\nthat are aligned with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite.\n                               64                               \nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\non AOCI\n\nCiti measures the potential\nimpacts of changes in interest\nrates on the value of its AOCI\n, which can in turn impact\nCiti\u2019s common equity and\ntangible common equity. This\nwill impact Citi\u2019s CET1 and\nother regulatory capital\nratios. Citi seeks to manage\nits exposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential\n\nchanges in AOCI (and the\ncorresponding impact on the\nCET1 Capital ratio) relative\nto Citi\u2019s capital generation\ncapacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates, as\npotential monetary policy\ndecisions and changes in\neconomic conditions may be\nreflected in current market-\nimplied forward rates.

At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity. Currency-specific\ninterest rate changes and\nbalance sheet factors may\ndrive quarter-to-quarter\nvolatility in Citi\u2019s estimated\nIRE.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $1.2 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately six\nmonths.\n                               65                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and\nCET1 Capital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under six\ndifferent scenarios of changes\nin interest rates for the U.S.\ndollar and all other\ncurrencies in which Citi has\ninvested capital as of March\n31, 2024. The 100 bps downward\nrate scenarios are impacted by\nthe low level of interest\nrates in several countries and\nthe assumption that market\ninterest rates, as well as\nrates paid to depositors and\ncharged to borrowers, do not\nfall below zero (i.e., the\n\u201cflooring assumption\u201d).

Changes\nin interest rates for\nmaturities between the\novernight rate and the 10-year\nrate are interpolated. The\ninterest rate exposure in the\ntable above assumes no change\nin deposit size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast included\nin the different interest\nscenarios presented. As a\nresult, in higher interest\nrate scenarios, customer\nactivity resulting in a shift\nfrom non-interest-bearing and\nlow interest rate deposit\nproducts to higher-yielding\ndeposits would reduce the\nexpected benefit to net\ninterest income. Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) Scenario 1 includes the\nimpact from the following top\nfive non-U.S. dollar\ncurrencies, which represents\napproximately 50% of the total\nnon-U.S. dollar currency\nimpact: approximately $0.2\nbillion each from the British\npound sterling and Japanese\nyen, and approximately $0.1\nbillion each from the Indian\nrupee, Singapore dollar and\nSouth Korean won. These\nimpacts per currency are\ngenerally in the same\ndirection (estimated positive\nimpact in the +100 bps shock\nscenario) and not offsetting.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger under Scenario 2 than\nScenario 3, as Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook has relatively higher\ninterest rate exposure to the\nshort end of the yield curve.\nFor U.S. dollars, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is larger\nin magnitude than to upward\nrate shocks. This is because\nof the lower benefit to net\ninterest income from Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base at higher rate\nlevels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. For other non-U.S.\ndollar currencies, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because the combination of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nchanges related to Citi\u2019s\npension liabilities, results\nin a net position that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               66                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro, Singapore\ndollar and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies.\n\nThis, coupled with Citi\u2019s\nforeign currency hedging\nstrategies, such as foreign\ncurrency borrowings, foreign\ncurrency forwards and other\ncurrency hedging instruments,\nlessens the impact of foreign\ncurrency movements on Citi\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are presented\nin the table below.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of March 31, 2024, there were two back-\ntesting exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n                               74                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of March 31, 2024.\n(Including the U.S., Citi\u2019s\ntop 25 exposures by country\nwould represent approximately\n99% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries as of March 31,\n2024.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China.

In accordance\nwith a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all\nbalances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred\nto the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n(5) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with the dividends under footnote 4 and domestic deposit\nliabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.\n\n(6) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its\nindirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above\ntable, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would\nbe recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings only upon either the\nsubstantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank.\nCiti has separately described these risks in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               76                               \nDuring the first quarter of\n2024, Citi\u2019s Russia-related\nexposures increased by $0.4\nbillion, as presented in the\ntable above. The increase in\nexposure was driven by inflows\nfrom dividends received from\nRussian corporations on behalf\nof Citi\u2019s clients.\nApproximately 73% of Citi\u2019s\n$7.0 billion of total Russia\nexposure are corporate\ndividends that Citi cannot\nremit to its clients due to\nrestrictions imposed by the\nRussian government, of which\n$4.6 billion is held with the\nDeposit Insurance Agency as of\nMarch 31, 2024.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $0.2\nbillion as of March 31, 2024\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2023).\n\nCiti hedges its ruble/USD spot\nFX exposure in AOCI through\nthe purchase of FX\nderivatives. The ongoing mark-\nto-market of the hedging\nderivatives is also reported\nin AOCI . When the ruble\ndepreciates against the USD,\nthe USD equivalent value of\nCitigroup\u2019s investment in AO\nCitibank also declines. This\nchange in value is offset by\nthe change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nServices , Markets , Banking ,\nUSPB and All Other results\nhave been impacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.1 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct\nRussian counterparties\n(largely unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2023). This\nbalance does not include the\nadditional reserves for\ntransfer risk for exposures in\nRussia.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $65 million to-\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $54 million in\nestimated charges\n(approximately $1 million in\nBanking and $53 million in All\nOther , excluding the impact\nfrom any portfolio sales).\nThis estimate was revised down\nduring the first quarter of\n2024 from $58 million at\nDecember 31, 2023.

As of\nMarch 31, 2024, Citi continued\nto consolidate AO Citibank\nbecause none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi\u2019s foreign\nentity in Russia, Citi would\nbe required to (i) write off\nthe net investment of\napproximately $0.2 billion\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2023), (ii) recognize a CTA\nloss of approximately $1.6\nbillion (unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2023) through\nearnings and (iii) recognize a\nloss of $0.6 billion\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2023) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or\n                               77                               \nblock the funds until\napplicable sanctions are\nlifted or the payment is\notherwise authorized under\napplicable law.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its remaining\npresence in Russia and\nassociation with Russian\nindividuals or entities,\nwhether subject to sanctions\nor not, including Citi\u2019s\ninability to support its\nglobal clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 220\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, Citi had $1.4\nbillion of direct exposures\nrelated to Ukraine (compared\nto $1.5 billion at December\n31, 2023).\n                               78                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.6 billion (compared to $1.0\nbillion at December 31, 2023).\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar\n(USD) as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries such as Argentina\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary in accordance\nwith GAAP. Citi therefore\nrecords the impact of exchange\nrate fluctuations on its net\nArgentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings. Citi\nuses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net ARS-\ndenominated assets into USD.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the\nofficial ARS exchange rate was\n858.00, which devalued by 6%\nagainst the USD during the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina during\nthe quarter was primarily due\nto earnings associated with\nincreased client activity,\nCiti\u2019s normal onshore\noperations and interest income\nearned on the net investment,\nof which a significant portion\nis invested at high local\novernight rates in Argentina.\nAll of these effects\nsignificantly exceeded\ntranslation losses (net of\nhedges) of $55 million\nrecognized during the quarter.\n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina\nmaintains certain capital and\ncurrency controls that\ngenerally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access USD in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nTo the extent that such\ncontrols remain in place,\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nArgentina will, as a result,\ncontinue to be exposed to\nadditional foreign currency\ntranslation losses if it is\ndenominated in ARS and is\nunable to be remitted or\nexchanged. Furthermore, the\ncapital and currency controls\nhave resulted in indirect\nforeign exchange mechanisms\nthat some Argentine entities\nmay use to obtain USD,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\ngenerally precluded from\naccessing these alternative\nmechanisms, and under U.S.\nGAAP, these exchange\nmechanisms cannot be used to\nre-measure Citi\u2019s net monetary\nassets into USD. If\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate further converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations.\n\nOf the $1.6 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nMarch 31, 2024, Citi\u2019s net ARS\nexposure was approximately\n$0.9 billion. The net ARS\nexposure was reduced as of the\nend of the quarter as a result\nof Citi holding approximately\n$100 million of USD-\ndenominated loans as well as\napproximately $600 million of\ncertain local government bonds\nthat are indexed to the higher\nof the USD exchange rate or\nthe local inflation index. If\nCiti had not invested in such\ninstruments to reduce its ARS\nexposure, Citi would have\nrecognized additional\ntranslation losses during the\nfirst quarter of 2024. Given\ncurrent economic conditions\nand the local capital,\ncurrency and regulatory\nlimitations, Citi cannot\nguarantee the availability or\neffectiveness of such\nmechanisms to reduce its ARS\nexposure in the future.\n\nIn addition to reducing the\nARS exposure, Citi also seeks\nto economically hedge the\nexposure to the extent\npossible and prudent using\nnon-deliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of March 31,\n2024, Citi was unable to hedge\na substantial portion of the\nremaining ARS exposure, given\nthat the\n\noffshore NDF market remained\nilliquid. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute additional NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net ARS-denominated assets\nin earnings, without any\nbenefit from a change in the\nfair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure. Citi\ncannot predict the\navailability of hedging\ninstruments in the future nor\ncan it predict changes in\nforeign exchange rates and the\nresulting impact on earnings.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of March\n31, 2024.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.\n                               80                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the first\nquarter of 2024.

These items in the\ntable above represent the 2024\nquarterly ACL builds\n(releases) only. See \u201c All\nOther \u2014Divestiture-Related\nImpacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d\nabove.\n\n(2) As of March 31, 2024, in\nUSPB , Branded Cards ACLL/EOP\nloans was 6.4% and Retail\nServices ACLL/EOP loans was\n11.9%.\n\n(3) Includes ACL on Other\nassets and Held-to-maturity\ndebt securities . The ACL on\nOther assets includes ACL\nrelated to transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. for safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables are reflected in\nOther assets . These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover a R&S\n\ntimeframe. The R&S forecast\nperiod for consumer and\ncorporate loans is eight\nquarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n                               81                               \nFor its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that\nconsider the borrowers\u2019 probability of default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood\nand severity models used for estimating expected credit losses\nare sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including\nhousing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry, product and business segments. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s models determine expected credit losses based\non leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies,\nchanges in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends. Qualitative\nComponent The qualitative management adjustment component\nincludes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include but are not limited to portfolio\ncharacteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within\nhistorical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in\nthe credit environment and other factors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these\nare the following: \u2022 Transfer risk associated with exposures\noutside the U.S. for certain safety and soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law \u2022 Potential impacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and\nuncertainties, including those related to potential global\nrecession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and\ngeopolitical tensions \u2022 Normalization of portfolio performance\nand consumer behavior from low losses as a result of government\nstimulus and market liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic As of\nthe first quarter of 2024, Citi\u2019s qualitative component of the\nACL decreased quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily\ndriven by (i) a release of COVID-19\u2013related uncertainty\nreserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and losses continue to\nincrease and as these risks are captured in the quantitative\ncomponent of the ACL, and (ii) a release related to reserves for\nspecific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries\nand regions. Macroeconomic Variables As further discussed below,\nCiti considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic\nscenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative\ncomponent of the ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment\nrate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The tables below present Citi\u2019s forecasted\nquarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S.\nreal GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic\nforecast for Citi\u2019s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from\n1Q23 to 1Q24:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            2Q24       4Q24       2Q25       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.6  %     4.5  %     4.4  %         4.3  %  \n  at 1Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.5        4.5        4.4            4.3     \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.4        4.3            4.2     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.2        4.3        4.3            4.2     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.9        4.1        4.1            4.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2024       2025       2026     \n  Citi forecast                   1.0  %     1.0  %     2.0  %  \n  at 1Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.3        0.7        2.0     \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.1        1.0        2.0     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.4        1.4        1.7     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.5        2.3        1.8     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 1Q24, U.S. real GDP growth\nis expected to decline during\n2024, while the unemployment\nrate is expected to increase\nmodestly over the eight-\nquarter forecast horizon,\nbroadly returning to pre-\npandemic levels. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.4% in the third quarter\nof 2025. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2024 of 0.8%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.3%. Citi\u2019s ACL\nis sensitive to the various\nmacroeconomic scenarios that\ndrive the quantitative\ncomponent of expected credit\nlosses, due to changes in the\nlength and severity of\nforecasted economic variables\nor events in the respective\nscenarios. To demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of March 31, 2024\nto reflect the most severe\neconomic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions; therefore,\napplying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result\nin a hypothetical increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $5.4\nbillion related to\n                               82                               \nlending exposures, except for\nloans individually evaluated\nfor credit losses and other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of March 31,\n2024.\n\n1Q24 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe first quarter of 2024 was\n$21.8 billion, largely\nunchanged from December 31,\n2023. The net build of less\nthan $0.1 billion in the\nquarter was primarily driven\nby (i) a build of $0.3 billion\nin USPB , reflecting the\nimpact of macroeconomic\npressures related to the\nhigher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment, as\nwell as the seasonal mix shift\nfrom transactors to revolvers\nin U.S. cards, and (ii) a\nbuild of $0.1 billion in\nMarkets , due to changes in\nmacroeconomic variable\nassumptions related to loans\nin spread products. These\nbuilds were largely offset by\n(i) a $0.2 billion release in\nWealth , driven by a change in\nACL associated with the margin\nlending portfolio, and (ii) a\nrelease of $0.1 billion for\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition in Banking . Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof March 31, 2024. See Note 15\nfor additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL build was\n$0.1 billion in the first\nquarter of 2024, primarily\nreflecting the impact of\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment, as well as the\nseasonal mix shift from\ntransactors to revolvers,\nlargely offset by a release in\nWealth driven by a change in\nACL associated with the margin\nlending portfolio. This\nresulted in a March 31, 2024\nACLL balance of $15.5 billion,\nor 4.07% of total funded\nconsumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans increased to\n8.16% at March 31, 2024,\nprimarily related to seasonal\nvolume and mix changes, as\nwell as the impact of\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment, compared to 7.67%\nat December 31, 2023. For the\nremaining consumer exposures,\nthe level of reserves relative\nto total funded loans was\n1.16% at March 31, 2024,\ncompared to 1.25% at December\n31, 2023.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of $0.1 billion in the\nfirst quarter of 2024, largely\ndriven by Markets due to the\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariable assumptions related\nto loans in spread products,\nlargely offset by changes in\nthe portfolio composition in\nBanking . This resulted in a\nMarch 31, 2024 ACLL balance of\n$2.8 billion, or 0.97% of\ntotal funded corporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.1 billion in the first\nquarter of 2024, which reduced\nthe ACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $1.6 billion. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby a release for specific\nrisks and uncertainties\nimpacting vulnerable\nindustries and regions.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build of less\nthan $0.1 billion on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost for the first\nquarter of 2024. Including\nFX/Other, the ACL reserve\nbalance decreased $0.1 billion\nto $1.8 billion as of March\n31, 2024, compared to $1.9\nbillion as of December 31,\n2023. See Note 15 for\nadditional information.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti elected the modified CECL\ntransition provision for\nregulatory capital purposes\nprovided by the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 final rule.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from the adoption of\nCECL, as well as the ongoing\nadjustments for 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021, started to\nbe phased in on January 1,\n2022 and will be fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 15 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests for goodwill\nimpairment annually as of\nOctober 1 (the annual test)\nand conducts interim\nassessments between annual\ntests if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that\nwould more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nThe impairment tests performed\nin the fourth quarter of 2023\nresulted in the fair values of\nCiti\u2019s reporting units\nexceeding their carrying\nvalues for all reporting\nunits. Additionally, the tests\nresults showed that the fair\nvalue of the Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM reporting unit\nas a percentage of its\ncarrying value was 106%, with\nthe carrying value including\napproximately $1.1 billion of\ngoodwill. For each of the\nremaining reporting units,\nfair value exceeded carrying\nvalue by at least 10%.\n\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nexecutes on its transformation\nand strategy. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

The increase for the first quarter was from temporary\ndifferences and the year-over-year increase was primarily a\nresult of Citi\u2019s geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi\u2019s $29.9\nbillion of net DTAs, $14.1 billion (compared to $12.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023) was deducted in calculating Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital, and the remaining $15.8 billion was appropriately risk\nweighted under the Basel III rules. The $14.1 billion of DTAs\ndeducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.9 billion\nrelated to tax carry-forwards, with $3.6 billion of temporary\ndifferences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations,\nreduced by $1.4 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily\nassociated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets\nthat were separately deducted from capital. DTA Realizability\nCiti believes that realization of the net DTAs of $29.9 billion\nat March 31, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on management\u2019s\nexpectations of future taxable income generation in the\njurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration\nof available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic\n740, Income Taxes ).\n                               84                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nMarch 31, 2024. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure is generally\nrequired even where the\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings were conducted in\ncompliance with applicable\nlaw. To the extent that\ntransactions or dealings for\nits clients are permitted by\nU.S. law, Citi may continue to\nengage in such activities.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2024, Citigroup identified one\ntransaction that was\nreportable pursuant to Section\n219. On January 12, 2024,\nCitibank, N.A. processed a\ntransaction between the\nCentral Bank of Iran (the CBI)\nand an international\norganization. The CBI sent\nfunds in yen, through\nCitibank, N.A., Tokyo Branch,\nwhich were then converted to\nU.S. dollars and transferred\nto the international\norganization\u2019s U.S. dollar\n(USD) account at Citibank,\nN.A., New York Branch. The\ntotal value of the payment was\nUSD 19,616,884.32. The\ntransaction represented a\npayment for the Government of\nIran\u2019s membership dues to the\ninternational organization and\nwas processed pursuant to\ngeneral licenses issued by the\nU.S. Department of the\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign\nAssets Control. Citibank\nrealized approximately USD\n5,905.00 for incoming and\noutgoing payments fees and a\nforeign exchange transaction\nfee.\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nForm 10-Q, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations, are \u201cforward-\nlooking statements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995. In addition,\nCitigroup may make forward-\nlooking statements in its\nother documents filed or\nfurnished with the SEC, and\nits management may make\nforward-looking statements\norally to analysts, investors,\nrepresentatives of the media\nand others.\n\nGenerally, forward-looking\nstatements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead\nrepresent Citigroup\u2019s and its\nmanagement\u2019s beliefs regarding\nfuture events.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer.\n\n(4) Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities represent non-cash investing and financing\nactivities, respectively, and are not included in the non-cash\ninvesting activities presented here.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND\nACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements as of March 31, 2024 and for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the opinion\nof management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes included within\nCitigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). Certain financial\ninformation that is normally included in annual financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim\nreporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted. Management\nmust make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While\nmanagement uses its best judgment, actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates. As noted above, the Notes to these\nConsolidated Financial Statements are unaudited. Throughout\nthese Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to\nCitigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates have been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements and notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation. Cash equivalents are defined as\nthose amounts included in Cash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk\nmanagement activities are classified in the same category as the\nrelated assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due\nfrom banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities\nSubject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual\nSale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in\npractice whereby certain entities included the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it\nclarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an\nequity security should not be considered part of the unit of\naccount of the equity security and, therefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature\nand remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances\nthat could cause a lapse in the restrictions. Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial\nstatements of the Company. Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic\n323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expands the scope\nof tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional\namortization method of accounting. Under the proportional\namortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is\namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits that are received by the investor, with the\namortization of the investment and the income tax credits being\npresented net in the income statement as components of income\ntax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the Company to elect to\nuse the proportional amortization method to account for an\nexpanded range of eligible tax-incentivized investments if\ncertain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1,\n2024, which did not have a material impact to the financial\nstatements of the Company. TDRs and Vintage Disclosures In March\n2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and\nmeasurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.\nAdopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of\n$ 352million and an increase in other assets related to held-\nfor-sale businesses of $ 44million, with a corresponding\nincrease to retained earnings of $ 290million and a decrease in\ndeferred tax assets of $ 106million on January 1, 2023. The ACL\nfor corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement\napproach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this\nASU.\n                               98                               \nASU 2022-02 eliminated the accounting and disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With\nthe elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term\nover which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for\nmodified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the collateral. Consumer Loans Upon\nadoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the\nuse of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered\nTDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate\ndiscounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the\nborrowers\u2019 probability of default, loss given default and\nexposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates smaller-balance homogeneous loans\nformerly considered TDRs for expected credit losses, whereas\npreviously those loans had been individually evaluated. The ASU\nalso requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves\nprincipal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-\nthan-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a\ncombination of those types of modifications. In addition, the\nASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs\nby year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to\ndisclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning\nas of the date of adoption. See Note 13 for these new\ndisclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.\nLong-Duration Insurance Contracts In August 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services\u2014Insurance: Targeted\nImprovements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts ,\nwhich changes the existing recognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued\nby an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves\nthe timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for\nfuture policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based\noptions or guarantees associated with deposit (or account\nbalance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of\ndeferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-\nduration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance\npolicies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted\nby the requirements of ASU 2018-12. Citi adopted the targeted\nimprovements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $\n39million decrease in Other liabilities and a $ 27million\nincrease in AOCI , after-tax. Fair Value Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer\nMethod In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01,\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method , intended to better align hedge\naccounting with an organization\u2019s risk management strategies.\nSpecifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer\nmethod to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed\nportfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable\nand non-prepayable assets. Upon the adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to reclassify securities held-to-maturity to\nthe available-for-sale category provided that the reclassified\nsecurities are designated in a portfolio hedge. Coincident with\nthe adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred\nHTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair\nvalue of approximately $ 3.3billion and $ 3.4billion,\nrespectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and\nhedged them under the portfolio layer method. FUTURE ACCOUNTING\nCHANGES Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets In\nDecember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08,\nIntangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60):\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to\nimprove the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an\nentity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting\nperiod, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The\namendments also improve the information provided to investors\nabout an entity\u2019s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure\nabout significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and\nchanges during the reporting period. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.\nCiti does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the\nguidance. Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness\nof income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public\nbusiness entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate\nreconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by\nnature and for foreign tax effects by jurisdiction that meet a\n5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax\nrate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include\nstate and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect;\nforeign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws or tax credits;\neffect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances;\nnontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in\nunrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include\nqualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions\nthat contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect\nof the state and local income tax category and explanation of\nthe nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling\nitems. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose\nincome taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by\nfederal, state and foreign taxes and\n                               99                               \nby jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative\nthreshold. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective\nwith the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the\nASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1,\n2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures , intended to improve reportable\nsegments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes\na requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM)\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or\nloss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how\nthe CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss\nin assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources, and all segments\u2019 profit or loss and assets\ndisclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with\nthose introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis.\nThe amendments also clarified that public entities are not\nprecluded from reporting additional measures of a segment\u2019s\nprofit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM. The ASU is\nrequired to be adopted on a retrospective basis and will be\neffective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31,\n2024 and interim periods for the interim period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2025. Citi is currently evaluating the impact of the\nstandard on its disclosure of reportable segments and related\ndisclosures.\n                              100                               \n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,\nSIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND\nOTHER BUSINESS EXITS\n\nSummary of Discontinued\nOperations The Company\u2019s\nresults from Discontinued\noperations consisted of\nresidual activities related to\nthe sales of the Egg Banking\nplc credit card business in\n2011 and the German retail\nbanking business in 2008. All\nDiscontinued operations\nresults are recorded within\nAll Other . The Company\u2019s\nIncome (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations, net\nof taxes was $( 1) million and\n$( 1) million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Cash\nflows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n                              101                               \nSignificant Disposals\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Citi had closed the sales of nineconsumer\nbanking businesses within All Other \u2014Legacy Franchises.\nAustralia closed in the second quarter of 2022, the Philippines\nclosed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and\nThailand closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, India and Vietnam\nclosed in the first quarter of 2023, Taiwan closed in the third\nquarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the fourth quarter of\n2023.

See operating segment details in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain\ncustomer balances between All Other\u2014 Legacy Franchises, Services\n, Markets and Banking in preparation for the IPO of the Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial\nreclassifications.

Citi's consolidated results\nremain unchanged for all periods presented.\n\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with each respective\nbusiness segment or component are included in determining\nrespective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that\nare attributable to a particular business segment or component\nare generally allocated from All Other based on respective net\nrevenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.\nRevenues and expenses from transactions with other operating\nsegments or components are treated as transactions with external\nparties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding\ncharges paid by operating segments and funding credits received\nby Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in net\ninterest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations\nwithin All Other to reconcile the operating segment results to\nCiti\u2019s consolidated results. The accounting policies of these\nreportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K.\n\nThe following tables present certain information regarding the\nCompany\u2019s continuing operations by reportable operating segments\nand All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-\nrelated impacts.

Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                              110

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 15.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K. When the qualitative\nassessment indicates that the\nequity security is impaired,\nits fair value is determined.\nIf the fair value of the\ninvestment is less than its\ncarrying value, the investment\nis written down to fair value\nthrough earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 :\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                    March 31, 2024               2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value          $           1,706    $         1,639  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                        Three Months Ended             \n  Measurement                             March 31,             \n  alternative(1):                              2024       2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses        $                     16    $    35  \n  Downward changes for                            \u2014         20  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                             49         30  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 23 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                        March 31, 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          351  \n  Downward changes for                                      34  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       999  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a third-\nparty subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage\nloans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a three-monthperiod during\nwhich the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with their original contractual terms.\nUpon successful completion of the trial period, and the\nborrower\u2019s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the\nborrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the\nmajority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be\nenrolled in a permanent modification. During the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023, $ 11million and $ 25million of\nmortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs, respectively.\nMortgage loans of $ 2million and $ 1million had gone through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n                              142                               \nTypes of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect\nThe following tables provide details on permanent consumer loan\nmodifications granted during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by\ntype of modification granted and the financial effect of those\nmodifications:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) The above tables reflect activity for loans outstanding as\nof the end of the reporting period.

allowance for credit losses on\nloans, leases and unfunded lending commitments as of March 31,\n2024 was $ 19,925million, an increase from $ 19,873million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in the ACLL was primarily driven\nby macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary\nand interest rate environment impacting both card portfolios and\nchanges in macroeconomic assumptions impacting loan spread\nproducts, as well as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to\nrevolvers, partially offset by lower card balances in Branded\nCards and Retail Services and a change in ACL associated with\nthe margin lending portfolio.

The increase was primarily driven by\nmacroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary and\ninterest rate environment impacting both card portfolios, as\nwell as the seasonal mix shift from transactors to revolvers,\npartially offset by lower U.S. card volumes. Corporate ACLL\nCiti\u2019s total corporate ACLL as of March 31, 2024 was $\n2,772million, an increase from $ 2,714million at December 31,\n2023.

Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current presentation. See Note 3.\nCiti tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the\nannual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual\ntest if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-\nlikely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were\nidentified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of\nMarch 31, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nWhile the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key\nassumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic\nand business environments continue to evolve as management\nexecutes on its transformation and strategy. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to\ndiffer from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.\n\nIntangible Assets\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows:\n                                                                \n           Ma\u2026

The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              158                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets\ninclude those assets that can only be used to settle obligations\nof consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In\naddition, the assets include third-party assets of consolidated\nVIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities\nof consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts\nwhere creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to\nthe general credit of Citigroup.\n

In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets .\n\nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages. The amounts of\nthese fees were as follows:\n                                                                \n                                 Three Months Ended             \n  In millions of                          March 31,             \n  dollars                                      2024       2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Servicing fees          $                      32    $    33  \n  Late fees                                       \u2014          1  \n  Total MSR fees          $                      32    $    34  \n                                                                \nIn the Consolidated Statement\nof Income these fees are\nprimarily classified as\nCommissions and fees , and\nchanges in MSR fair values are\nclassified as Other revenue .\n                              162                               \nRe-securitizations The Company engages in re-securitization\ntransactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE\nin exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer\nnon-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization\nentities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThese securities are backed by either residential or commercial\nmortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients. As of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi held noretained\ninterests in private label re-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes U.S.\ngovernment-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency)\nsecurities. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Citi\ntransferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately\n$ 4.4billion to re-securitization entities, compared to\napproximately $ 5.3billion for the three months ended March 31,\n2023. As of March 31, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by\nCiti totaled approximately $ 1.8billion (including $ 732million\nrelated to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024),\ncompared to $ 1.7billion as of December 31, 2023 (including $\n930million related to re-securitization transactions executed in\n2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained interest as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 were approximately $ 69billion and $\n84.1billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the Company did not consolidate any private label or\nagency re-securitization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Conduits At March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 19.1billion and $ 21.1billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded commitments\nwith clients of approximately $ 17.8billion and $ 16.7billion,\nrespectively. Substantially all of the funding of the conduits\nis in the form of short-term commercial paper. At March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities\nof the commercial paper issued by the conduits were\napproximately 71and 68days, respectively. Each asset purchased\nby the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit\nenhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess\nspread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party\nguarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of\napproximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit\nfrom the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s\nassets with a minimum of $ 200million to $ 350million. The\nletters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 1.9billion and $ 2.1billion as of March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across\nmulti-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in\nthe event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany owned $ 8.0billion and $ 10.1billion, respectively, of\nthe commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and\nthe Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits. Municipal Securities\nTender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB\ntrusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the\nCompany. The Company provides other liquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable interest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers that totaled $ 1.2billion and $\n1.2billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit\nare offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out\nprovisions.\n                              163                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below.

Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market\nvaluation adjustments that may be required on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n                                                                \n               Hedgi\u2026                                           \n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset.

Gross\npositive fair values are offset against gross negative fair\nvalues by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in\nrespect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given\ncounterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in\nthe offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the\nCompany\u2019s balance sheet presentation, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians,\nbut which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an\nevent of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting and collateral rights has

For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented\nbelow:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Amount                                                        \n  of             Three                                          \n  gain          Months                                          \n  (loss)         Ended                                          \n  recog\u2026         March                                          \n  inAOC\u2026           31,                                          \n  deriv\u2026          2024                       2023               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inter\u2026                                                        \n  rate      $                   306    $                    21  \n  contr\u2026                                                        \n  Forei\u2026                                                        \n  excha\u2026                          1                        -12  \n  contr\u2026                                                        \n  Total                                                         \n  gain                                                          \n  (loss)    $                   307    $                     9  \n  recog\u2026                                                        \n  inAOCI                                                        \n                 Other          Net         Other          Net  \n               revenue       inter\u2026       revenue       inter\u2026  \n                             income                     income  \n  Amount                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  gain                                                          \n  (loss)                                                        \n  recla\u2026                                                        \n  fromA\u2026                                                        \n  earni\u2026                                                        \n  Inter\u2026                                                        \n  rate      $        \u2014    $    -342    $        \u2014    $    -469  \n  contr\u2026                                                        \n  Forei\u2026                                                        \n  excha\u2026            -1            \u2014            -1            \u2014  \n  contr\u2026                                                        \n  Total                                                         \n  gain                                                          \n  (loss)    $       -1    $    -342    $       -1    $    -469  \n  recla\u2026                                                        \n  fromA\u2026                                                        \n  earni\u2026                                                        \n  Net                                                           \n  pretax                                                        \n  change                                                        \n  in                                                            \n  cash                    $     650                  $     479  \n  flow                                                          \n  hedges                                                        \n  inclu\u2026                                                        \n  withi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) .

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nwas $ 13billion and $\n15billion, respectively. The\nCompany posted $ 11billion and\n$ 12billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of March\n31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of March 31, 2024, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n0.5billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 34million upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n5.1billion and $ 4.3billion as\nof March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively. At\nMarch 31, 2024, the fair value\nof these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n4.9billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nMarch 31, 2024 was $\n104million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n40million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n4.3billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 121million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n29million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              174                               \n23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n26 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nvalue drivers are observable\nin the market. \u2022 Level 3:\nValuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which\none or more significant inputs\nor value drivers are\nunobservable . As required\nunder the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven criteria to\ndetermine whether an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based on the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA) and funding

See Notes 19 and 23.\n                              191                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $( 750) million and $( 433) million for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk\nwere estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit\nspreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest income and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest income and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                   March                       31,              \n                31, 2024                      2023              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     4,452    $  8,854    $    4,518    $  7,594  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess              26         -13            88          10  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014           \u2014             \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           1             \u2014           1  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 375million and $\n391million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n                              192                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2024\nand 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a\nloss of $( 16) million and a gain of $ 9million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades\nunallocated precious metals investments and executes forward\npurchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading\ncounterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals\ninvestment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid\nand Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious\nmetal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. Certain\nMortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option for certain purchased and originated prime\nfixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans\nHFS.

as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n121billion and $ 138billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n(3) Includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\nunder the sponsored member repo program.\n                              195                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse In addition to the amounts presented in\nthe tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $\n11million and $ 11million at March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Futures and Over-\nthe-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services\non central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and\nremitted in this manner was approximately $ 17.1billion and $\n17.8billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying amounts\nof the liabilities related to the guarantees and\nindemnifications included in the tables above amounted to\napproximately $ 0.9billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively. The\ncarrying value of financial and performance guarantees is\nincluded in Other liabilities . For loans sold with recourse,\nthe carrying value of the liability is included in Other\nliabilities . Collateral Cash collateral available to Citi to\nreimburse losses realized under these guarantees and\nindemnifications amounted to $ 55.1billion and $ 52.5billion at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Securities\nand other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $\n74.3billion and $ 67.7billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 3.0billion and $\n3.1billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to\ncover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications;\nhowever, the value of such property has not been determined.\n\nPerformance Risk\nPresented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts\nof future payments that are classified based on internal and\nexternal credit ratings. The determination of the maximum\npotential future payments is based on the notional amount of the\nguarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged.

Such fees (net of certain\ndirect costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the commitment period.\nThe table below summarizes Citigroup\u2019s credit commitments:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0                                                           \n  milli\u2026                     Outsi\u2026         March       Decem\u2026  \n  of\u00a0                            of           31,          31,  \n  dolla\u2026          U.S.       U.S.(\u2026          2024         2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  simil\u2026    $      691    $   4,038    $    4,729    $   5,345  \n  lette\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  credit                                                        \n  One-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026           859          726         1,585        1,245  \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026                                                        \n  Revol\u2026                                                        \n  open-\u2026                                                        \n  loans                                                         \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  by             5,415           23         5,438        5,495  \n  one-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026                                                        \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  prope\u2026                                                        \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  real                                                          \n  estat\u2026                                                        \n  const\u2026        13,524        1,392        14,916       15,266  \n  and                                                           \n  land                                                          \n  devel\u2026                                                        \n  Credit                                                        \n  card         618,246       65,104       683,350       677,0\u2026  \n  lines                                                         \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  other        212,591       104,4\u2026       317,058       312,3\u2026  \n  consu\u2026                                                        \n  loan                                                          \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n  Other                                                         \n  commi\u2026         4,918          223         5,141        5,146  \n  and                                                           \n  conti\u2026                                                        \n  Total     $  856,244    $  175,9\u2026    $  1,032,\u2026    $  1,021\u2026  \n                                                                \n(1) Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries\nunder sales agreements are reflected in their original\ncategories until the respective sales are completed.\n(2) Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nOther Commitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank.

LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment. These leases may\ncontain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination\nfeatures; however, these\noptions do not impact the\nlease term unless the Company\nis reasonably certain that it\nwill exercise options.

CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nThe following information supplements and amends, as applicable,\nthe disclosure in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note,\nCitigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and\nformer officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties. In\naccordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for\ncontingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax\nmatters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable\nthat a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted\nfrom time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional\ninformation. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation\nto those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously\nincurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties\naffecting recognition are resolved. If Citigroup has not accrued\nfor a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure\nto loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular\nmatter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably\npossible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of\nthe aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in\nexcess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an\nestimate can be made. At March 31, 2024, Citigroup estimates\nthat the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters\nranges up to approximately $ 1.2billion in the aggregate. As\navailable information changes, the matters for which Citigroup\nis able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition, while many estimates presented in\nfinancial statements and other financial disclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may be subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss\narising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are\nsubject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of\nmaking an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or\nincomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future rulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives\nof adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to\nbe wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often\nnot amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate. Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of\nCitigroup\u2019s management, based on current knowledge and after\ntaking into account its current accruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters described in this Note would not be\nlikely to have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition\nof Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or\nindeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the\ninherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters could, from time to time, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s consolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup\u2019s\naccounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including\nfor any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K. Equities Trading Incident Matters\nGovernment and regulatory agencies in the U.K. and Europe are\nconducting investigations or making inquiries regarding an\nequity desk trading error that occurred on May 2, 2022.\nCitigroup is cooperating with these investigations and\ninquiries. FDIC Special Assessment On November 29, 2023, the\nFDIC published a final rule implementing a special assessment to\nrecover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, estimated to be\napproximately $16.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2024, Citi\nreceived notification from the FDIC that the estimate increased\nto $20.4 billion, which may be further adjusted by subsequent\nrecoveries. The FDIC plans to provide institutions subject to\nthe special assessment with an updated estimate of each\ninstitution\u2019s quarterly and total special assessment expense\nwith its first-quarter 2024 special assessment invoice. In the\nfirst quarter of 2024, Citi increased its total accrued\nestimated liability to $ 2.0billion within Other liabilities and\nreported the corresponding incremental expense of $ 251million\nin Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome (and within Corporate/Other in All Other ) for the\nspecial assessment. Foreign Exchange Litigation On February 8,\n2024, in MICHAEL O\u2019HIGGINS FX CLASS REPRESENTATIVE LIMITED v.\nBARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS, Michael O\u2019Higgins FX Class\nRepresentative Limited withdrew its application requesting\npermission to commence collective proceedings against the\ndefendants.

Interchange Fee\nLitigation On February 22, 2024, the district court issued\ndecisions on several summary judgment motions, including denials\nof both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 motions. On March 26, 2024,\nVisa, MasterCard and the injunctive relief class plaintiffs\nfiled a motion seeking preliminary approval of the parties\u2019\nagreement to settle, and the court scheduled a preliminary\napproval hearing for June 13, 2024.
